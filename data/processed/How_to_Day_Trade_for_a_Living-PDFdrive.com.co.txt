Figure 1.1 - “COVID-19” and “stock market” keyword 
Google search trends between April 2019 and April 
2020. As you can see, there is a clear correlation. 
As the stock market drop hit the news cycles, people 
started searching more and more about the stock 
market in Google!

Figure 1.2 - Comparison between the bull market of 
2019 and the bear market of 2020, as shown by the 
change in share value of 500 of the largest American 
companies. These companies are tracked by the S&P 
500 and are t raded in an Exchange-traded fund known 
as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ticker: SPY). For 
your information, S&P refers to Standard & Poor’s, 
one of the companies which used to track this

Figure 3.1 - Screenshot of my trade on MOH on 
February 16, 2017 showing my entry, exit and stop

3 to 1.

Figure 3.2 - Screenshot of MOH on February 16, 2017. 
This is the example of a bad risk/reward. As you 
can see, the profit-to-loss ratio is less than 2 to 
1 and is not tradeable. You have missed the 
opportunity.

 Andrew’s 10 Rules of Day Trading  
Rule 1:  Day trading is not a strategy to get rich quickly.  
Rule 2:  Day trading is not easy. It is a serious business, and 
you should treat it as such.  
Rule 3:  Day traders do not hold positions overnight. If 
necessary, you must sell with a loss to m ake sure you do not 
hold onto any stock overnight.  
Rule 4:  Always ask, “Is this stock moving because the overall 
market is moving, or is it moving because it has a unique 
fundamental catalyst?”  
Rule 5: Success  in day trading comes from risk management 
- finding low -risk entries with a high potential reward. The 
minimum win:lose ratio for me is 2:1.  
Rule 6:  Your broker will buy and sell stocks for you at the 
Exchange. Your only job as a day trader is to manage risk. 
You cannot be a successful day trader with out excellent risk 
management skills, even if you are the master of many 
effective strategies.  
Rule 7:  Retail traders trade only Stocks in Play, high relative 
volume stocks that have fundamental catalysts and are being 
traded regardless of the overall mark et. 
Rule 8:  Experienced traders are like guerrilla soldiers. They 
jump out at just the right time, take their profit, and get out.  
Rule 9:  Hollow candlesticks, where the close is greater than 
the open, indicate buying pressure. Filled candlesticks, where 
the close is less than the open, indicate selling pressure.  
Rule 10: Profitable trading does not involve emotion. If you 
are an emotional trader, you will lose your money.
