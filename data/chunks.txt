Author’s Acknowledgments

My wife, Nancy, is always there ready with an encouraging pat or a suggestion for the perfect word that is eluding me. My assignment editor, David Craig, and other USA TODAY editors have been supportive of my writing and journalism career from the start. Steve Minihan, a fi  nancial advisor and professor for UCLA Extension, has provided invaluable instruction and

Finally, I wanted to thank my family for giving me the tools and determination

If someone gave you a dollar for every newfangled stock-picking method 
invented every year, well, you probably wouldn’t need a book on invest-
ing. You’d already be rich. 
Investors are constantly barraged with new ways to pick stocks and buy

Chunk 118 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
stocks. There’s no shortage of pundits, professional investors, and traders who all claim to know the best ways to invest. The trouble is, most of their advice is conflicting and often confusing. 
Maybe it’s this constant swirl of investment babble that tempted you to pick

Chunk 119 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
up this book. And if so, you made a wise decision. This book will help you get back to the basics of investing and understanding business. Rather than chasing hot stocks that whip around, Fundamental Analysis For Dummies will show you how to study the value of a business. You’ll then use that informa-tion to make intelligent decisions about how to invest. 
While faddish stock-picking systems come and go, fundamental analysis has

Chunk 120 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
been around for decades. The ability to pore over a company’s most basic data and get a good idea of how a company is doing, how skilled the management team is, and whether or not a company has the resources to stay in business is a valuable skill to have. 
Fundamental analysis is best known as a tool for investors trying to get a

Chunk 121 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
very detailed assessment of what a company is worth. But you might be sur-prised to learn you don’t have to be an investor to use fundamental analysis. If you buy a warranty from a company and want to know if the company will be able to honor it, that calls for fundamental analysis. If you just want to know “how well” a company is doing, you might also want to use fundamental analysis. And journalists, too, can use fundamental analysis to find stories that will interest readers.

Chunk 122 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The aim of this book is to show you what fundamental analysis is and help 
you use it as a way to better understand business and investment.

Fundamental Analysis For Dummies is one of the most approachable texts

Chunk 123 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
to tackle this somewhat complex topic. Rather than bog you down with the nitty-gritty details that academics pull their hair over, I’ve attempted to lay out all the main topics and techniques you’ll need to apply fundamental anal-ysis to a variety of business tasks. 
And while fundamental analysis is useful for anyone with an interest in busi-

Chunk 124 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
ness, I appreciate the fact you are likely hoping to make some money from fundamental analysis. And for that reason, the book is largely targeted toward investors who are either hoping to use fundamental analysis to manage their portfolios or to enhance their current system of selecting stocks. 
As the author, I can share the tricks, tips, and secrets I’ve learned from a

career writing about online investing for readers just like you. In the course of writing for USA TODAY, including a daily online column about investing called “Ask Matt” at USATODAY .com, I’ve answered thousands of reader ques-tions that may be the same ones you have. 
Fundamental Analysis For Dummies gives you all the tools you need to access

Chunk 126 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
fundamental data, process them, and make decisions. The book, however, stops short at showing you how to actually buy or sell stocks by choosing a broker and entering orders. If you’re interested in the actual process of buying or selling stocks, that topic is covered exhaustively in my Investing 
Online For Dummies (Wiley). 
Conventions Used in This Book
I want to help you get the information you need as quickly as possible. To help you, I use several conventions:

Chunk 127 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Monofont is used to signal a Web address. This is important, since there are so many Web addresses in the book.
 ✓ Italics signal a word is a unique and important term for online investors.
 ✓ Boldfaced words make the key terms and phrases in bulleted and num-bered lists jump out and grab your attention.

Chunk 128 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Sidebars, text separated from the rest of the type in gray boxes, are interesting but slightly tangential to the subject at hand. Sidebars are generally fun and optional reading. You won’t miss anything critical if you skip the sidebars. If you choose to read the sidebars, though, I think you’ll be glad you did.

What You’re Not to Read

Chunk 129 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
What You’re Not to Read
This book is a reference, which means you don’t have to read it from begin-
ning to end (any more than you have to read a dictionary from beginning to end to get what you need from it). If you’re in a hurry, you can even skip cer-tain pieces of information and still get the gist of what you need. Here’s what you can safely skip: 
 ✓ Anything marked with a Technical Stuff icon: For more on this icon, see the “Icons Used in This Book” section, later in this Introduction.

Chunk 130 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Text in gray boxes, which are known as sidebars: Sidebars contain interesting — but not essential — information. 
 ✓ The copyright page: Sure, the publisher’s attorneys’ feelings will be hurt, but you can skip the fine print without missing out on anything important. Shh! I won’t tell. 
Foolish Assumptions

spare you from technical terms, I stick to plain English as much as possible. (When I have no choice but to use investing jargon, I tell you what it means.) But I also assume more advanced investors might pick up this book too, looking to discover a few things they didn’t already know about fundamental analysis. The book takes on more advanced topics as you progress through it, and it carefully selects online resources that will add new tools to your investing toolbox.

How the Book Is Organized
All the chapters in this book are self-contained and can be read by them-selves. If you’ve been dying to learn how to do a discounted cash flow analy-sis, go on, skip ahead and dive in.

to read about for years. And don’t fear that you’ll get in over your head if

Chunk 135 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
you read the back of the book first. If there are concepts you need to know at any point, I’ve carefully added references to those pages in the book, so you can jump around. This book is a reference, and you shouldn’t feel as if you need to suffer through topics you already know or don’t care to know. With that said, though, the book is assembled in a logical order. My goal is to start simple, and then ramp things up as the book goes on.

Chunk 136 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The book is divided into five parts, and the following sections give you a brief 
description of what you can find within each part.
Part I: What Fundamental Analysis 
Is and Why You Should Use It
If you’ve heard investors talk about fundamental analysis, but were never

Chunk 137 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
quite sure what it was, this part is for you. You’ll discover not only what fun-damental analysis is, but also why it’s so powerful. You’ll even find out how fundamental analysis might help boost your investment success even if you have other methods of buying and selling stocks. After reading the chapters in this part, you should have a good idea of what’s entailed in fundamental analysis and how it can benefit you.
Part II: How to Perform 
Fundamental Analysis

Chunk 138 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Part II: How to Perform 
Fundamental Analysis
Here’s where we roll up our sleeves and start getting into specifics.

Chunk 139 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Fundamental analysis starts with the fundamental data companies provide about themselves. You’ll uncover what kinds of data companies generate and provide to the public, as well as what the numbers mean. And rather than set-ting you on a wild goose chase to find the data yourself, I give you very spe-cific instructions on the best ways to retrieve all the fundamental data you’ll need. In this part, too, you’ll get an understanding of how to start not just reading fundamental data, but digging

Chunk 140 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
not just reading fundamental data, but digging in and gleaning insights from them.

Part III: Making Money from 
Fundamental Analysis
Look. I’m not going to flatter myself and believe you’re reading this book 
because you want to read all my clever analogies. You’re probably interested in fundamental analysis because you want to make money or at least get a

better understanding on how to gauge the health and success of companies.

Chunk 142 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Investors who use fundamental analysis to get a solid understanding of busi-nesses and their values get a huge advantage over those who blindly chase stocks. In this part, you’ll get exposed to some of the more advanced tech-niques fundamental analysts use to get insights about companies that aren’t apparent to some investors. 
Part IV: Getting Advanced with 
Fundamental Analysis
The chapters in this part take fundamental analysis even further, highlighting

Chunk 143 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
some of the more thorough techniques available. You’ll find how to analyze an industry, the broad economy, and even how to marry fundamental analy-sis with other methods of evaluating investments. 
Part V: The Part of Tens

Chunk 144 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Part V: The Part of Tens
The tens chapters break down concepts in a top-ten list structure. You can discover what financial secrets fundamental analysis allows you to uncover (Chapter 20), you can zero in on the things you should look at when analyz-ing a company (Chapter 21), and you can find out once and for all what fun-damental analysis can’t do (Chapter 22).

Chunk 154 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
a bowl of super-sweetened cereal that looks like it was made by Willy 
Wonka himself, you probably do something first. More times than not, you just might take a glance at the nutrition label that spells out what’s in the box. 
You might not know what guar gum, guarana, or other ingredients that often

Chunk 155 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
show up on the labels of such processed foods are, but you can get a pretty good idea of what’s good for you and what’s not. If a bottle of apple juice, for instance, has a list of ingredients longer than your arm and is filled with stuff you can’t pronounce, you know you’re not drinking squeezed apples. Being aware of what’s in a food may or may not sway your decision to eat it, but at least you know what you’re putting into your body.

Chunk 156 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Companies and stocks, too, come with similar labels. All companies that are 
publicly traded, or that lure money from the investing public, are required to disclose what they’re all about. Just as food processors must list all the ingre-dients that go into their products, companies must tell investors what they’re composed of. 
Unfortunately, though, a giant multinational company can’t put all the infor-

Chunk 157 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

Reading these critical financial statements and gleaning insights from them

Chunk 158 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
are the most basic goals of fundamental analysis. Fundamental analysis is the skill of reading through all the information companies provide about them-selves to make intelligent decisions. Just as you’d want to know what’s in that Frankenfood you’re about to bite into, you want to know what’s in an invest-ment you’re thinking about adding to your portfolio. 
Why Bother with Fundamental Analysis?

Chunk 159 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Why Bother with Fundamental Analysis?
You might wonder why you need to hassle with fundamental analysis. After all, at every family picnic there’s undoubtedly the loudmouthed relative who’s filled with all sorts of can’t-go-wrong stock tips. Why bother with tech-nical things like net income or discounted cash flow analysis when you can just turn on the TV, write down a couple of stock symbols, buy the stocks and hope for the best?

Chunk 160 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Similarly, you might figure learning how companies operate is just needless 
information. After all, you don’t need to know about fuel injection systems, suspensions, and car battery technology to drive a car. And you don’t need to know what’s going on behind the curtain to enjoy a play. Some investors figure they can just pick a couple of hot stocks, buy them, and drive off to riches. 
 If the vicious bear market that began in 2007 taught investors anything, it’s

Chunk 161 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
that blindly buying stocks just because you might “like” a company or its products was hardly a sound way to tune up a portfolio. Chasing hunches and personal opinion about stocks is often not a great way to invest, as you’ll find out in Chapter 20. 
Some of the real values of 
fundamental analysis
Ever notice how there’s always a new wonder diet promising to make you

Chunk 162 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
skinny, and a new pill to make you healthier? More times than not, though, it seems these things never work. Getting healthy comes back to the basics — a balanced diet and exercise. 
The same goes with investing. Believe it or not, investing can be somewhat 
full of fads. There’s always a new investment pundit or economist with a new way to pick winning stocks. And just as an hour on the treadmill will do you

Chunk 163 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

more good than a bottle full of miracle pills, successfully choosing stocks 
often comes back to fundamental analysis. 
Fundamental analysis is the classic way to examine companies and invest-
ments for a variety of reasons, including the fact it is:

Chunk 164 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Based on fact, not opinion: It’s easy to get caught up in general enthu-siasm about what a company is doing or the products it’s selling. But fundamental analysis blinds you to this investment hype and gets you focused on cold-hard business realities. It doesn’t matter if all the kids in your neighborhood are buying a company’s products, if the company isn’t making any money at selling them.

Chunk 165 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Good at pinpointing shifts in the business’ health: If a company’s suc-cess is starting to fade, you’ll see it show up on the fundamentals. No, there won’t be a giant sign saying “Sell this stock.” But there are clues if you know how to look, as you’ll discover in Chapter 18. Companies are required to disclose key aspects of their business, so if there’s a prob-lem, a fundamental analyst will often be early at spotting some trouble.

Chunk 166 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ All about execution: Companies’ CEOs are usually good at getting inves-tors focused on the future and how things are going to get better next quarter. But the fundamentals are based in reality. Just think of children who say how hard they’re working at school. The report card is still the tangible evidence of how things are actually going.

Chunk 167 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ A way to put price tags on companies: What’s a painting worth? What’s a used car worth? Just as with anything else with subjective value, the price is generally what someone is willing to pay for it. The stock market, an auction of buyers and sellers, does a good job putting price tags on companies. But fundamental analysis gives you another way to see just how much investors, by buying or selling stock, are paying for a stock. 
Driving home an example

Chunk 168 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Driving home an example
One of the best recent examples of how fundamental analysis can help you and your portfolio is General Motors. For decades, GM represented the might of U.S. industriousness, know-how, and creativity. GM commanded a mas-sive market value of $3.5 billion in 1928, says Standard & Poor’s. I’ll step you through what market value means in more detail in Chapter 3, but for now, just know that GM was the most valuable company by far in 1928.

Chunk 169 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

For decades, investors figured a dollar invested in GM was money in the 
bank. The company slugged through upturns and downturns and was a last-ing power that helped drive the U.S. economy. The company kept paying fat dividends and kept powering profits higher. 
But investors who blindly bet GM would remain a lasting force and ignored

Chunk 170 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the fundamental signs of trouble suffered a brutal blow on June 1, 2009. On that day, which will forever remain one of the lowlights of capitalism, GM became the fourth-largest public company to seek bankruptcy protection, according to BankruptcyData.com. Shares of GM stock collapsed to just 75 cents a share, down 97% from their level just three years before.
Fundamental analysis may not have helped you predict this shocking out-

Chunk 171 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
come of GM. Concrete elements from the company’s financial statements, though, could have tipped you off to just how challenged GM was well before it became a penny stock. GM vs. Ford 
Even months before GM filed for bankruptcy protection, fundamental analysis could have served you well. 
Back in January 2009, seeing both GM and Ford

Chunk 172 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Back in January 2009, seeing both GM and Ford 
facing intense financial strain, many investors wondered if either one was worth taking a bet on. Some helpful fundamental analysis tools, including an analysis of the statement of cash flows, could have determined whether you lost a fortune or enjoyed a big gain. 
I’ll show you how to read the statement of cash

Chunk 173 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
I’ll show you how to read the statement of cash 
flow in detail in Chapter 7. But for now, I’m just giving you a real example of why fundamental analysis matters to whet your appetite. At the beginning of 2009, both Ford and GM were con-stantly in the news. Both faced a tough busi-ness climate and both had depressed stock prices: Ford began 2009 at $2.46 a share and GM $3.65. 
But a quick fundamental analysis showed Ford

Chunk 174 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But a quick fundamental analysis showed Ford 
was the much better bet. Ford ended the quarter with $27.5 billion in cash and burnt $600 million in cash. Don’t let the numbers scare you at this point. I’m just exposing you to a basic free cash flow analysis, as you’ll learn about later. Just for now, know that at the quarterly rate, Ford had enough cash to last nearly 46 quarters. 
Over at GM, however, the company ended

Chunk 175 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Over at GM, however, the company ended 
the quarter with just $15.9 billion in cash. Meanwhile, it burnt through $8.9 billion during the quarter. A fundamental analyst knew right away the company wasn’t going to make it through the year at that rate. That’s critical information to have known.
Knowing how to do this one type of fundamen-

Chunk 176 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Knowing how to do this one type of fundamen-
tal analysis may make a world of difference for investors. In the following six months, shares of Ford jumped 149% to $6.13. Ford also did not accept government funding assis-tance. Meanwhile, shares of GM crashed 79% to 75 cents.

Chunk 177 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Putting fundamental analysis to work
It’s easy to get consumed with the fast-money trading aspects of stocks. 
Exciting TV reports about stocks on the move and companies that have new products practically turn investing into a sporting event. In fact, if you listen to some traders talk, they rattle off companies’ ticker symbols in rapid-fire delivery just as sports fans talk about teams. Flashing arrows and rapid trad-ing can become an addiction for people who get into it.

Chunk 178 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
And it’s exactly the headache and insanity fundamental analysis is trying

Chunk 179 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
to help you avoid. After all, stocks rise and fall each minute, day, and week based on a random flow of news. The constant ups and downs of stocks can sometimes confound logic and reason. Many readers of my Ask Matt column at USATODAY .com are baffled when a stock falls even after the company reports what appears to be good news. Trying to profit from these short-term swings is a game for gamblers and speculators. It’s futile on a long-term basis.

Chunk 180 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But that’s not to say investing is gambling. Remember that those stock sym-
bols you see flashing red and green aren’t dice, horses, or cards. They’re more than just the two, three, or four letters of their ticker symbol. 
When you buy a stock, you’re buying a piece of ownership in companies that 
make and sell products and services. You’re buying a claim to the companies’ future profits. Owning a piece of a real business over time isn’t gambling, it’s capitalism.

Chunk 181 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Fundamental analysis forces you to focus on investing in businesses, not stocks. 
You’re not buying a lottery ticket, but a piece of ownership in a company. 
If jumping in and out of stocks at the right time isn’t the way to riches, then

Chunk 182 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
what is the trick to successful investing? The answer is to stop thinking of stocks as just symbols that gyrate each day. The goal of fundamental analysis is to help you step away from the short-term trading and gambling of stocks. Instead, you approach investing as if you’re buying a business, not rolling the dice. 
Fundamental analysis ideally helps you identify businesses that sell goods

Chunk 183 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
and services for more than what they paid to produce them. Fundamental analysis is your tool to evaluate how good a company is at turning raw mate-rials into profits. 
Certainly, famed investor Warren Buffett is one of the best-known users of 
fundamental analysis. You will read more about how Buffett applies funda-mental analysis to investing in Chapter 3.

 No matter how you choose investments currently, you can likely apply funda-
mental analysis. Even if you’re the kind of investor who likes to buy diversified mutual funds and hold onto them forever, called a passive investor, it can be 
helpful to understand basic financial characteristics of the companies.

Chunk 185 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Knowing what fundamentals to look for
Knowing what makes a company tick isn’t as convoluted as it may sound. Companies are so regulated and scrutinized, all the things you need to pay attention to are usually listed and published for all to see. Generally, when you hear about a company’s fundamentals, the key elements to be concerned with fall into several categories including:

Chunk 186 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Financial performance: Here you’re looking at how much a company collects from customers who buy its products or services, and how much it keeps in profit. Terms you probably hear quite a bit about, such as earnings and revenue, are examples of ways fundamental analysts evaluate a company’s financial performance.

Chunk 187 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Financial resources: It’s not enough for a company to sell goods and services. It’s not even enough to turn a profit. Companies must also have the resources to invest themselves and keep their businesses going and growing. Aspects of a business, such as its assets and liabilities, are ways to measure a company’s resources.

Chunk 188 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Management team: When you invest in a company, you’re entrusting your money with the CEO and other managers to put your cash to work. Fundamental analysis helps you separate the good managers from the bad.

Chunk 189 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Valuation: It’s not enough to identify which companies are the best. What’s a “good” company anyway? Definitions of “good” can run the gamut. You also need to consider how much you’re paying to own a piece of a company. If you overpay for the best company on the planet, it’s still likely you’ll end up losing money on the investment. You’ll read more about this in Chapter 10 and Chapter 11.

Chunk 190 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Macro trends: No company operates in a vacuum. A company’s perfor-mance is highly influenced by actions of competitors or the condition of the economy. These broad factors need to be incorporated into funda-mental analysis, as you’ll discover in Chapter 15 and Chapter 16.

Knowing what you need
One of the great things about running as a hobby is all you need is a pair 
of decent shoes. And basketball? Just grab a ball and find a hoop. No fancy equipment is required. The same goes with fundamental analysis. Much of the data you need is provided free by companies and can be accessed in sec-onds from any computer connected to the Internet. 
Fundamental analysis can get pretty involved. But at its most basic form,

Chunk 192 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
there are just a few basic ideas behind fundamental analysis, including:

Chunk 193 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Awareness of the benefits of fundamental analysis: Since fundamental analysis takes some know-how and time spent learning a bit, you’ll want to know ahead of time why you’re going to the trouble. Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 highlight the payoff of fundamental analysis. Even if you’re a passive investor, or one who simply buys a basket of stocks and holds on, there are reasons why fundamental analysis might be worth your while.

Chunk 194 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Retrieval of financial data: Getting all the key data you need to apply fundamental analysis is easy, if you know where to look. Chapter 4 gives you quick tips on how to round up all the data you’ll need.

Chunk 195 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Basic math: There it is: The M word. There’s no way around the fact there will be some number crunching involved in some aspects of fun-damental analysis. Don’t worry, I’ll guide you to help keep the math as painless as possible. One of the key tools you’ll need is for trend analy-sis, which you will read about in Chapter 4.

The same importance of execution is part of fundamental analysis. You may

Staying focused on the bottom line
If there’s one thing investors may agree is of upmost importance, it’s the 
company’s profitability. When it comes down to it, when you invest in a stock you’re buying a piece of the company’s profitability. Knowing how to read and understand how much profit a company is making is very important when it comes to knowing whether or not to invest. 
The income statement, described in full detail in Chapter 5, will be your guide

Chunk 199 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
when you’re trying to determine how profitable a company is. What might also surprise you is that the income statement can tell you a great deal about a company, in addition to just how much income it brings in. 
Sizing up what a company has to its name

Chunk 200 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Sizing up what a company has to its name
During times of intense financial stress, investors often make a very impor-tant mental shift. They’re not so concerned about making money as they are about just getting their money back. Similarly, when things get tough in the economy, investors are less interested in how profitable a company is and are more mindful of whether a company will survive.
When you’re trying to understand the lasting power of a company, fundamen-

Chunk 201 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
tal analysis is of great value. By reading the company’s balance sheet, you can get a rundown of what a company has — its assets — and what is owes — its liabilities. Monitoring these items give you a very good picture of how much dry powder a company has to endure a tough period. Chapter 6 explores the balance sheet in more detail. 
Burn baby burn: Cash burn

Chunk 202 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Burn baby burn: Cash burn
One of the biggest killers of companies, especially smaller firms just starting out, is cash flow. While a company might have a great product concept, excel-lent management, and even dedicated financial backers, timing is everything. If a company is using up cash to pay its bills and employees but not bringing in enough cold hard cash from customers, it can run into a giant financial headache very quickly.

Chunk 203 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
If there’s one thing I hope you pick up from this book, it’s how fundamental 
analysis helps you keep a close eye on how much cash is coming into and out of a company. Monitoring cash flow is critical to know if a company is running perilously empty on cash, which you’ll dig into in more detail in Chapter 7. But cash flow is also a very important way fundamental analysis helps you put a price tag on a company, as you will find out about in Chapter 11.

Financial ratios: Your friend in 
making sense of a company
As you flip through the book and jump around to different topics that interest

Chunk 205 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
you, you might be a bit bewildered by just how many pieces of data funda-mental analysts must deal with. You’ve got the financial statements that mea-sure just about every aspect of the company. It can be intimidating to decide what numbers matter most and which ones can be ignored. 
Financial ratios will be a great help here, as you’ll see in Chapter 8. These 
ratios draw all sorts of fundamental data from different sources and put them into perspective.

Chunk 206 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Financial ratios are also important because they form the vocabulary of fun-
damental analysts. If you’re ever at a cocktail party where analysts are talking about gross margins and accounts receivable turnover, I want you to be pre-pared. By the way, that sounds like a pretty boring party. 
I’ll show you a whole host of financial ratios in Chapter 8 that are the favor-

Chunk 207 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
ites used by many fundamental analysts. You’ll soon be using seemingly unre-lated pieces of financial data about a company to glean some very important conclusions about the company. 
Making Fundamental Analysis 
Work For You
Imagine a young child who memorized an entire dictionary, but can’t use

Chunk 208 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
a single word in a sentence. That’s a basic analogy of some investors’ fun-damental analysis knowledge. You might, too, know some things about the income statement and balance sheet and have a great knowledge of what’s contained in the statements. But when it comes to applying your know-how, that can be a bit trickier. 
Putting fundamental analysis in action requires taking everything you know

Chunk 209 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
about a company and mixing in some estimates and best guesses about the future to arrive at a decent expectation of whether or not to invest in a company.

Using fundamentals as 
signals to buy or sell
Buying a stock at the right time is very difficult. But knowing when to sell it

Chunk 210 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
is even tougher. And while fundamental analysis won’t tell you the exact best time and day to buy or sell, it can at least give you a better understanding of things to look out for when it comes to making decisions. 
 If you’re a passive investor and buy large diversified baskets of dozens of

Chunk 211 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
stocks, you can afford to buy and hold stocks. Even if one company runs into big-time trouble, it’s just one holding in a large basket of stocks. However, if you choose to invest in individual stocks, monitoring the fundamentals is criti-cal. If you start noticing a company’s trend deteriorating, you don’t want to be the last investor to get out.

 If there’s a primary goal of fundamental analysis, it’s avoiding stock disasters 
like the ones listed above. Losses that large are nearly impossible to recover from in a single person’s lifetime. You can read more about why avoiding investment disasters is so critical in Chapter 18.

Using fundamental analysis as your guide
As Table 1-1 shows, investing in individual stocks is very risky. Losses can be 
sizeable. That’s why you want to invest with your eyes wide open. Just as you probably wouldn’t dare fire a loaded weapon or jump out of an airplane with-out proper training, the same goes with investing in individual stocks.

Chunk 215 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Luckily, fundamental analysis provides investors with a host of very specific 
tools to help them protect themselves. And while the tools of fundamental analysts aren’t foolproof, as you will see in Chapter 22, they give investors guidance of when a stock might be getting a little dangerous or the underly-ing trends might be changing.

Try to remember what it was like being a beginner at something you’re 
good at now. Whether it was karate, ballet, or basketball, as a beginner, 
you may have been tempted to bypass all the basics and go straight for the advanced techniques. For instance, it’s natural to want to try breaking boards with your bare hands or doing pirouettes or slam-dunks on your first day of trying something new. 
Good coaches, though, encourage you to slow down and start from the

What Is Fundamental Analysis?

Chunk 223 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
What Is Fundamental Analysis?
Ask 20 people how they choose their investments, and you’ll probably hear 
20 different methods. Some like to buy stocks recommended by a friend or broker. Others think it’s wise to invest in companies making products they personally enjoy and use. A few even consult with astrologers (seriously). What most people, though, have in common is that they feel they’re always paying too much for stocks and selling them when they’re too cheap.

Chunk 224 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Perhaps you swing between different investment strategies like some folks

Chunk 225 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
switch diets to lose weight. Experimenting with different ways of picking stocks may have worked fine as stocks made breathtaking advances in the 1990s. But the crash of 2008 changed everything, making 2008 a harsh reminder that it’s possible to overpay for stocks. Not realizing that ahead of time can be hazard-ous to your portfolio, and perhaps after losing money a few too many times, you’re looking for a method with a little more science behind it.

Chunk 226 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
That’s where fundamental analysis comes in. Fundamental analysis is one of 
the most sound and primary ways to evaluate investments. As a fundamen-tal analyst, you carefully and thoroughly study every aspect of a company’s operations. Much of your analysis will be focused on financial statements companies provide, as described briefly in this chapter and in more detail later in this book. 
Going beyond betting

Chunk 227 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Going beyond betting
If you’re like most investors, even the words fundamental analysis may turn you off a bit. Fundamental analysis sounds somewhat stuffy and academic. And it’s true that fundamental analysis finds much of its roots in academia. But you might be surprised to find you probably are using some basic forms of funda-mental analysis in your life, perhaps even in places you wouldn’t expect. 
One of my favorite examples of where a type of fundamental analysis is used

Chunk 228 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
is at the horse races. Before a race, you’ll notice groups of bettors doing some serious work trying to pick the day’s winning horses. Some may pore over the life histories of horses in the race, getting to know the jockeys and their techniques, and even studying how wet or dry the track is. 
While investing isn’t exactly like horse racing, the analogy is a helpful way to

Chunk 229 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
understand fundamental analysis. For instance, some fundamental analysts will study a company like a bettor will study a horse. How successful has the com-pany been recently, and is it healthy and well-cared for? Next, in fundamental analysis you might study a company’s management like a bettor would consider 
06 506455-ch02.indd   2206 506455-ch02.indd   22 9/24/09   10:06:02 PM9/24/09   10:06:02 PM23  Chapter 2: Getting up to Speed with Fundamental Analysis

Chunk 230 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the jockey. Is the management experienced, and has it competed against expe-
rienced players? Lastly, you must evaluate the broad economic climate, just like a bettor will consider the weather and condition of the track. 
But here’s where things get even trickier. It’s not good enough to find the

Chunk 231 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
best company, or horse, to take the metaphor a little further. After all, if all the other bettors at the track did the same work and picked the same horse that you selected, you have a problem. The odds would be adjusted so that the payout on the favorite horse will fall. Bettors know that picking a favorite horse to win doesn’t pay off much. And you’re also taking a chance that the favorite will lose and cost you money. Similarly, if you invest in a company that’s widely considered to be a

Chunk 232 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
in a company that’s widely considered to be a darling with other investors, your payoff is reduced for reasons you can discover in Chapter 3.

Chunk 233 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Now that you see what fundamental analysis is, broadly speaking, consider 
how it can be applied to investing. Fundamental analysis is used to size up investments in several key ways:

Chunk 234 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Analyzing the financial statements: Fundamental analysts pore over public documents companies provide to understand how the business is performing. Many fundamental analysts’ starting point is digging into a company’s financial statements to see how profitable a company is, how rapidly it is growing, what kind of financial health it’s in, and whether it has the ability to withstand tough economic times.

Chunk 235 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Getting an idea of how solid a company is: Many fundamental ana-lysts are fixed-income investors. These investors have loaned money to companies, usually by buying bonds. Bond investors give money to a company in exchange for an agreed-upon payment each month, quarter, or year. Since bond investors get a fixed amount pay, they don’t care if a company is wildly successful. Bond investors, unlike stock investors, don’t get a share of future earnings and growth. Bond investors just want to know

Chunk 236 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
and growth. Bond investors just want to know the company is healthy enough so it can keep paying inter-est and return the money it borrowed.

Chunk 237 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Understanding the value of a company: Stock investors use fundamen-tal analysis to gauge whether a company’s stock is a good deal or not. By studying financial statements, financial analysts determine whether a stock’s price undervalues or overvalues the company.

Chunk 238 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Going beyond the financials: Fundamental analysis goes beyond where accounting stops. While accountants wish to precisely measure business activity, fundamental analysts want to analyze it in a way to help make decisions. Using fundamental analysis, you will evaluate other factors that affect a company’s prospects. Common factors you might consider include sizing up a company against its rivals, determining how skilled a company’s management team is in navigating through boom and bust times,

Chunk 239 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
is in navigating through boom and bust times, and understanding the broad economic climate.

Chunk 240 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

 Fundamental analysts take all the intelligence they gather to arrive at an 
investment decision and to take action. The most common question funda-mental analysts ask themselves is whether a stock, at its current price, is cheap or expensive. The answer to that question will determine whether you choose to invest or not.

Chunk 241 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Understanding how fundamental 
analysis works
 Fundamental analysts often dig well beyond a company’s financial statements 
and try to unearth things. Sometimes fundamental analysts might spot a trend

Chunk 242 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
forming before a company’s management acknowledges it. A fundamental ana-lyst, for instance, might visit a retailer’s stores and see how crowded they are to get an idea of what earnings might be in the future. Similarly, the fundamen-tal analyst may try to get an idea of future demand by considering how busy a company’s suppliers are. The goal of fundamental analysis is to measure how much a company is worth by using any shred of information possible.

Chunk 243 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The way you use fundamental analysis to understand what a company is 
worth gets down to the core essence of what a business is. With fundamental analysis, your goal is to monitor a company to see how it brings in money by selling goods and services to generate revenue. Next, you’ll determine how much of revenue a company manages to keep after paying its expenses. What’s left after paying all the bills is profit, or earnings.

Chunk 244 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The fact that fundamental analysts take action on their research is what sepa-
rates them from accountants. Fundamental analysts compare what they think a company is worth with what other investors think. If the stock is underval-ued, the fundamental analyst will buy the stock. Accountants, on the other hand, have the job of recording sales and revenue, but not trying to profit off their findings.

 Fundamental analysis isn’t perfect. But as you’ll discover in this chapter, funda-
mental analysis is rigorous and rooted in understanding the most basic elements 
of business. So even if you have no plans to be a fundamental analyst, knowing how fundamental analysis works can only boost your investment success.

Chunk 248 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Who can perform fundamental analysis?
You don’t have to be a high-powered investor to use fundamental analysis. If you 
have an interest in finding out more deeply about how companies work, you’re a candidate for learning about fundamental analysis. In fact, knowing how to read, analyze, and take action from information you glean about a company can be helpful for many users, including:

Chunk 249 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Stock investors: Those looking to take an ownership stake in a company have a great financial incentive to master fundamental analysis. What they find out about companies may help them to decide when a good time to buy or sell may be.

Chunk 250 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Lenders: When you give someone a loan, you want to make sure they have the ability to pay you back. If you lend money to a company, per-haps by buying bonds they issue, you’re more concerned about getting your money back than about making a killing on the investment.

Chunk 251 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Mutual fund investors: Even if you don’t pick individual stocks or bonds to invest in, you probably own mutual funds that do. Mutual funds are investments that invest in a basket of individual securities. Using fun-damental analysis, you can investigate some of the stocks your mutual funds may own. You might take a look at the top holdings of your mutual fund and question why your mutual fund owns them.

Chunk 252 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Employees: Workers may be anxious about the health of their company for several reasons. Using the same techniques an investor would use, you can study your company’s financial resources and roughly estimate how likely it might be to pursue aggressive cost-cutting, like layoffs. Employees who depend on a pension paid by a former employer might also want to study the health of the company.

Chunk 253 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Board members: Whether you’re a board member of a large company, your local museum, or your condominium association, understanding how to understand the flow of money in and out can make you more valuable. Understanding fundamental analysis will help you be a solid watchdog of the organization’s management by looking at the facts, not the promises.

 ✓ Donors: Even some nonprofit charities disclose their financial standing. 
Fundamental analysis will help you see where donations are being spent and whether or not money is getting to those in need or being soaked up by the bureaucracy.

Chunk 255 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Consumers: As a consumer, you might not think of yourself as investing in a company. And in most cases, you’re not. Sometimes, even when you buy a product, you’re forming a long-term relationship with a company. When you buy a car or an insurance product, you’re probably going to be connected with the company for many years. It’s a good idea to know how to analyze a company if you plan on relying on its products for a long time.

Following the money

Chunk 259 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Following the money
One of the basic rules of investigative journalism is following the money. Tracing the movement of dollars through an organization will quickly show you the motives of the leaders, availability of resources, and vulnerabilities. Regulators will often follow the movement of money to pinpoint illegal car-tels, Ponzi schemes, and other frauds. 
 All this might sound very cloak-and-dagger. But there’s something to be

Chunk 260 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
learned from approaching fundamental analysis with the mind of an investiga-tor. Your job is to take available information and attempt to dig up data your-self to get a complete picture of a company and whether or not it’s a suitable place for you to entrust your money. Following the way money moves through a company will tell you more about it than just about anything else. 
While no two companies are the same, the basics of business are universal.

Chunk 261 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
That’s why fundamental analysis is such a powerful tool you can apply to high-tech companies, low-tech companies, and everything in between.

The trade cycle begins with a business idea, but more specifically when a

or overhead, to make all this happen. Overhead costs include everything from advertising, to research and development, to hiring skilled managers. 
Now here’s where fundamental analysis comes in. A few questions a funda-

What Fundamental Analysis Isn’t
Fundamental analysis is a well-known way of choosing investments. It’s often the preferred method taught in business schools, largely due to its roots in things that can be measured and understood. But it’s not, by any means, the only method of choosing stocks. 
 If you’re still a little foggy on what fundamental analysis is, comparing it with 
other ways of evaluating investments might clear things up for you.

How fundamental analysis stacks 
up against index investing
If fundamental analysis seems like a lot of work, you can probably identify

Chunk 267 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
with index investors. Index investors think taking the time to pore over com-panies’ financial statements is a whole lot of trouble for nothing. Index inves-tors figure any information to be gleaned from company reports has already been extracted by other investors and acted upon. 
For instance, if a company’s stock was truly undervalued, other investors will

Chunk 268 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
have already recognized it and bought the stock. If enough investors buy a stock, they push the price up, and the shares are no longer undervalued. And thanks to the proliferation of electronic investing, analysts and investment firms with access to instantaneous information feeds can make such trading moves very quickly. 
For that reason, index investors think trying to buy and sell stocks at just the

Chunk 269 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
right time, or use market timing, is impossible. In addition, index investors say that if there is an edge to fundamental analysis, it’s wiped out by the cost and time consumed digging out the information. For that reason, index inves-tors skip the fundamental analysis, and instead:

Chunk 270 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Diversify: Rather than trying to pick the companies and stocks that will do best, fundamental analysts buy small stakes in as many stocks as possible. Generally, index investors will buy mutual funds that own hundreds, if not thousands, of stocks. That way, if any one company stumbles badly, the loss is very small as a percentage of the portfolio.

Chunk 271 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Buy index funds: Since index investors don’t think fundamental analy-sis gives investors an edge, they don’t see any reason to pay a mutual fund manager to pick stocks for them. Instead, they buy mutual funds that own all the stocks in popular stock indexes, such as the Dow Jones industrial average or Standard & Poor’s 500. The Dow mirrors the ups and downs of 30 large, well-known companies, and the S&P 500 mea-sures the market’s performance using 500 of the largest companies’ shares.

Chunk 272 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Focus on costs: Index investors assume the best way to make money in the stock market is by keeping costs low. Index funds generally have low expenses. And rather than spend personal time researching stocks, index investors generally buy a diversified basket of stocks and then forget about the holdings.

Comparing fundamental analysis

Chunk 273 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Comparing fundamental analysis 
with technical analysis
Like index investors, investors who use technical analysis shake their heads 
in disapproval when they see fundamental analysts poring over spreadsheets and financial statements. They, like index investors, see all the effort that goes into fundamental analysis as a waste of time and calculator batteries. That’s because technical analysts assume that any information worth know-ing is reflected in a stock price.

Chunk 274 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But technical analysts agree with fundamental analysts in one important way:

Chunk 275 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
They, too, think it’s possible to beat the stock market. Unlike index inves-tors, who think that timing the market is futile, technical analysts think stock prices move up and down in observable patterns. Knowing how to recognize patterns in stock price movements can signal a technical analyst the best times to get in, and out, of stocks. Technical analysts may not even care what a company does, since they’re just looking at the price chart. To a technical analyst, buying and selling at the

Chunk 276 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
To a technical analyst, buying and selling at the right time is more important than buying and selling the right stock. Technical analysts pay close attention to:

Chunk 277 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Stock price charts: Technical analysts focus on stock price charts, which are graphs that plot a stock’s movement over a period of time. These charts will show instantly whether a stock is rising or falling in addition to how many trades, or volume, are occurring.

Chunk 278 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Trading patterns: Much as an astronomer sees patterns of stars in the sky, technical analysts look for stock price movements that follow a pattern. For instance, if a stock price falls to a low level, rises a bit, and sinks back down to near that same low level, technical analysts call that a support level. A support is considered a point where demand for a stock is strong enough to stop it from sinking much further.

Chunk 279 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Moving averages: Technical analysts often pay close attention to a stock’s average price over a period of time, say 200 days. When a stock falls below its 200-day moving average, or its average price over the past 200 days, that means the stock is vulnerable to fall further, techni-cians say. The idea is that when stocks fall below their 200-day-moving average, many investors who bought in within the past year are losing money and may be nervous and quick to sell.

If you’re tired of trusting other people to tell you how a company is doing financially, you’re a prime candidate for fundamental analysis. Most likely, you might find yourself buying investments on a hunch or whim, only to find out later the company had some serious problems you didn’t know about. The whole premise of fundamental analysis is to reduce, if not eliminate,

speculation and wild guesswork from investing. Fundamental analysis is 
rooted in the idea that you want to look at cold, hard data to make informed decisions on why an investment might be worth buying. 
Above all, fundamental analysis is ideal for people who want to approach an

Chunk 289 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
investment fully informed of the risks and with their eyes wide open. An in-depth fundamental analysis on a stock will not only alert you to potentially troubling trends at a company, but also give you clues to whether a stock may be overvalued by investors who aren’t paying attention. An overvalued company is one that commands a stock price that well exceeds any possible profit it could generate for investors. 
In many ways, fundamental analysis is as much about helping you avoid poor

Chunk 290 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
investments as much as it about helping you find good ones.
The risks of fundamental analysis
Fundamental analysis, while it’s rooted in math and objective information, isn’t without its flaws. After all, if fundamental analysis was perfect, everyone would quit their day jobs, analyze stocks, and make bundles of money. That’s why it’s important to understand the shortcomings of fundamental analysis, which include: 
 ✓ Vulnerability to wrong data, including your assumptions:  Fundamental

Chunk 291 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
analysis is heavily based in fact. But if a company incorrectly reports data or you misinterpret them, you’re going to have a false conclusion. Miscalculations are especially likely when making assumptions about things like a company’s future growth rate, future interest rates, or profits.

Chunk 292 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Overreliance on past data: Perhaps the biggest knock against funda-mental analysis is how much stock it puts in a company’s past perfor-mance. There is some truth to that, since numbers companies report can be a month or more old. However, true fundamental analysis uses historical numbers to make an educated guess about the future.

Chunk 293 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Bad timing: Let’s say you do all the homework in researching a stock. You find a stock that appears to be a screaming buy, so you buy it. Guess what? A stock can remain a screaming buy for many years or even decades until investors come to the same conclusion. Fundamental ana-lysts often have to be wrong for a long time before making money.

Chunk 294 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Betting against the market: If you buy a stock because you think it’s a steal, you’re in effect betting against thousands of the most sophis-ticated trading desks around the world with access to the same data. If you think a stock is too cheap, you’re making the gamble that other investors are missing something you can see.

Chunk 295 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Concentrated positions: If you’re going to the trouble to meticulously 
study a company, you’re going to want to make sure you’re positioned to profit if you’re right. Unless you have a team of analysts working for you, when you find a stock that fits your fundamental criteria, you’re going to want to own a large chunk of it. As a result, investors who use fundamen-tal analysis may have large exposure to individual companies.

Chunk 296 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
This concept contradicts the idea of diversification, which is owning 
hundreds and hundreds of small pieces of many companies. With diver-sification, you’re spreading your risk over many companies so if one has a problem, it doesn’t hurt so badly. Fundamental analysts, though, think that owning just a few investments that you know inside and out is actu-ally safer than owning everything.

Putting a price tag on a stock or bond 
If you’ve ever wondered whether a stock is “cheap” or “pricey,” fundamen-tal analysis can be a big help. Fundamental analysis helps you understand exactly what you’re getting when you buy an investment. 
Here’s an example to help you see what I mean. Let’s say you have the oppor-

Chunk 299 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
tunity to buy a tree that literally grows dollar bills. How much should you pay for the tree? You might be tempted to pay millions of dollars, especially if others have their wallets out and start bidding. 
But, fundamental analysis can help you intelligently put a price tag on this

Chunk 300 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
amazing plant. By asking some questions and doing some due diligence, you can actually arrive at a correct price. The farmer tells you the tree grows 20 one-dollar bills every month. He also says the tree will likely die in a year and then stop growing money. Lastly, the farmer promises to pay you $20 a month if, for any reason, the tree stops growing money in less than a year.

Chunk 301 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
06 506455-ch02.indd   3206 506455-ch02.indd   32 9/24/09   10:06:02 PM9/24/09   10:06:02 PM33  Chapter 2: Getting up to Speed with Fundamental Analysis
Knowing these fundamental details, the tree can be priced. You now know the

Chunk 302 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
tree is expected to generate about $240. So, is the tree worth $240? Not so far. Remember, the tree won’t grow the $240 right away. You have to wait a year to get the whole wad of cash. Because you have to wait a year to get the $240, the tree is worth less than $240. So if there’s a bidding war for the tree that drives the price over $240, you know to walk away based on your fundamen-tal research. 
Being profitable by being a “contrarian”

Chunk 303 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Being profitable by being a “contrarian”
Being a successful fundamental analyst can be pretty lonely. If you’re trying to make money from studying a company and determine the company is worth more than its stock price, you’re betting that other investors bidding for the stock are wrong. 
Fundamental analysis, therefore, is at odds with the efficient market theory.

Chunk 304 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Efficient market theory says that trying to beat the market by picking win-ning stocks is futile. The strong form of the efficient market theory says that all information that’s knowable about a company is reflected in a company’s stock price. So, let’s say that after reading this book you dig through a com-pany’s financial statements and find that a company has great prospects. Efficient market theory would suggest that you’re not the first person to dis-cover this, and that other investors

Chunk 305 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
to dis-cover this, and that other investors have already bid the stock up with the same information.

Chunk 306 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But before you throw your hands up and give up on fundamental analysis, 
there are some caveats to the efficient market theory worth noting. Most impor-tantly, while stocks may reflect all information over the long term, there can be short-term periods when prices might excessively rise or fall due to extreme and fleeting optimism or pessimism. For instance, many high-technology stocks

Chunk 307 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
skyrocketed during the late 1990s, as investors bid up share prices on the idea that they’d be worth a fortune in the future. Fundamental analysts, look-ing at the fact many of the companies didn’t make money and never would, avoided the dot-com bubble. Eventually, the fundamentals caught up to them and many of the stocks collapsed 90% or more. In some cases, the companies completely failed. 
 To profit from fundamental analysis, you have to be comfortable going against

Chunk 308 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the crowd — or in Wall Street parlance — being a contrarian. When other investors are overly enthusiastic about a stock, they bid the price so high that it’s practically impossible for anyone to make money.

Unlike technical analysis, which may require sophisticated and costly stock

Chunk 310 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
chart services, most of the data you need for fundamental analysis is pro-vided free from nearly every company. Plus, many free online services offer increasingly detailed access to company financial data, making it easy for you to download and analyze. There are three key financial documents that are the cornerstone of financial analysis: the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows. 
Introducing the income statement

Chunk 311 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Introducing the income statement
Want to know how much a company made or lost during a year or a quarter? The income statement is for you. This financial statement steps you through all the money a company brought in and how much it spent to make that money. If you’ve ever read news stories about how much a company earned during a quarter, for instance, the information was taken off the company’s income statement. 
 The income statement is the financial statement containing data you probably

Chunk 312 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
hear the most about, including revenue, net income, and earnings per share. You can find out more about reading this important document in Chapter 5.
Balance-sheet basics

Chunk 313 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Balance-sheet basics
Want to know how much money a company has or how much it owes to others? That’s where the balance sheet comes in. This financial statement spells out all the cash a company has in addition to its debt. The difference between what a company owns (its assets) and what it owes (its liabilities) is its equity. Expressed slightly differently, the basic formula that applies to the balance sheet is:
Assets = Liabilities + Equity

Chunk 314 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
 Sometimes it’s helpful to understand corporate-finance jargon by putting it in 
personal-finance terms. If you’ve ever calculated your personal net worth by subtracting all your loans from all your savings, you’ve essentially created a balance sheet.

Getting the mojo of cash flows

Chunk 315 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Getting the mojo of cash flows
One of the first things fundamental analysts need to understand is that earn-

Chunk 316 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
ings aren’t necessarily cash. Accounting rules, for instance, allow companies to include in their earnings sales from products they haven’t actually col-lected from customers yet. Yes, you read that right. A company might say it earned $100 million, even though it hasn’t collected a dime from customers. This method of accounting, called accrual accounting, is done for a good reason. Accrual accounting lets analysts see more accurately how much it cost a company to generate sales.

Chunk 317 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But accrual accounting makes it critical for investors to monitor not just a 
company’s earnings, but how much cash it brings in. The statement of cash flows holds a company’s feet to the fire and requires it to disclose how much cold hard cash is coming into the company. The statement of cash flows lets you see how much cash a company generated from its primary business operations. The statement, though, also lets you see how much cash a com-pany brought in from lenders and investors.

Chunk 318 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Familiarizing yourself with financial 
ratios (including the P-E) 
While the financial statements are enormously valuable to financial analysts, 
they only go so far. Not only do companies tend to only give the information they’re required to, the data can only tell you so much. You didn’t expect companies to do everything for you, right? That’s how financial ratios can be very important. 
Financial ratios take different numbers from the income statement, balance

Chunk 319 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
sheet and statement of cash flows, and compare them with each other. You’ll be amazed at what you can find out about a company by mixing numbers from different statements. Financial ratios can provide great insight when applied to analysis. 
There are dozens of helpful financial ratios, which you can read about in 
more detail in Chapter 8. But at this point, you’ll just want to know the basic flavors and ratios and what they tell you, including:

Chunk 320 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Valuation: If you’ve ever heard of the price-to-earnings ratio, or P-E, you’ve used a financial ratio. The P-E is one of many valuation ratios. Valuation ratios help fundamental analysts find out if a stock is cheap or expensive by comparing the stock price to a basic piece of data about a company. For instance, the P-E ratio compares a stock’s price to its earn-ings. The higher the P-E, the more richly valued a stock is.

 ✓ Financial health: If a company is no longer a going concern and isn’t 
functioning, it’s not a great idea to invest in it. Some ratios, called liquid-
ity ratios, measure how easily a company is able to keep up with its bills. Fundamental analysts will look for red flags that a company might be about to face some tough times.

Chunk 322 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Return on investment: If you’re going to give your money to a company, either as a loan or investment, you want to make sure you’re getting something in return. Return on investment ratios help you determine how well the company is putting your money to work.

Chunk 323 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Operating performance: The more a company can increase its sales, while at the same time lower costs, the more profitable it is. This balanc-ing act is the essence of business. And the stakes for investors are huge, since the more profit a company generates, the bigger piece of the pie that’s left for investors.

every few minutes looking for a quick buck, fundamental analysis is more of a data-driven discipline. 
Fundamental analysts analyze investments by examining the business that’s

Chunk 330 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
behind a stock or bond. Even if you’re just looking to buy a few shares of a company, you approach the analysis with the same level of research, or due 
diligence, as if you’re thinking about buying the whole company. Fundamental analysis lets you approach a stock as an investor, not a speculator. 
 Investors look to buy a stock because they believe the underlying com-

Chunk 331 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
pany will generate profits in the future that exceed the price they’re paying. Speculators look to make money on an investment by simply finding someone else to sell it to for a higher price.
The careful consideration of a company’s fundamentals, such as revenue and

Chunk 332 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
earnings, is a key distinction of this approach from other methods of choos-ing investments. The name fundamental analysis really says it all, as the approach gets down to the most basic aspects of a business, including the trade cycle, which is discussed in Chapter 2. 
Fundamental analysis is generally connected with value investors. Value

Chunk 333 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
investors tend to buy stocks they think are undervalued, or have stock prices below what they think the company is actually worth. But fundamental analysis can help you no matter how you invest. Perhaps you’re a technical 
analyst, who studies stock charts to find stocks to buy. Maybe you’re an index

Chunk 334 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
investor, who buys all the stocks in a broad stock market index, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500. No matter what kind of investing you prefer, funda-mental analysis can help you find suitable stocks and investments. 
Picking stocks for fundamental reasons

Chunk 335 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Picking stocks for fundamental reasons 
Value investors are often drawn to the idea that they can get an edge on other investors by doing their homework and studying a company’s financial state-ments. These investors believe if they put in the time to understand a compa-ny’s business, accurately forecast its future, and pay the right price, they can achieve greater upside and less downside than the market as a whole.

There’s some truth to this. Academic studies have shown that stocks that are 
cheap, or value priced, tend to have strong long-term performance. 
 Fundamental analysis can also help you protect yourself from your own specu-

Chunk 337 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
lative juices. By studying the cold hard numbers of a company’s business, you can get a strong dose of reality while other investors get caught up in the hype surrounding a particular stock. Since fundamental analysis is based in the laws of business, it can give you a greater perspective on how much an investment is worth.
Many investors puzzle over how the price of a stock is determined. Knowing 
this is a key to seeing how fundamental analysis can help you.

Chunk 338 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
A stock’s price is determined by an auction, very similar to how the price on 
a Pez dispenser is set on eBay. Investors buy and sell stocks every trading day, pushing the price up and down based on how optimistic or pessimistic they are about a company’s future potential. Just as you can see a bidding war erupt over a Pez dispenser and push its value to extreme highs, the same can occur for a stock if many investors are willing to buy it.

Chunk 339 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
A great example of how fundamental analysis can help you spot a frenzy over 
a stock, causing its price to get out of line, occurred in March 2000. Shares of Palm Computing, a maker of the popular Palm electronic organizer (remem-ber those?), soared 150% in their first day of trading to more than $95 a share. At that price, investors put a total price tag of $54.3 billion on the company and its 23 million shares. 
Just a little bit of fundamental sleuthing could have protected investors from

Chunk 340 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the coming brutal collapse in the stock. Here’s how. Palm Computing was 95% owned by its parent company, 3Com, at the time. And the entire value of 3Com, including its 95% stock in Palm Computing, was just $28 billion. So why would investors be willing to pay nearly twice as much for a piece of 3Com? It’s kind of like paying $20 for a slice of pie when you can buy the whole pie for $10. Fundamental analysts knew something was a little off. And they were right. The stock lost more than 70% of

Chunk 341 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
they were right. The stock lost more than 70% of its value in just seven months.

Uses for the index investor
Index investors don’t try to pick individual stocks or time the market. Index investors buy a broad basket of investments and hold it for a long period of time (see Chapter 2 for more on index investors). Many index investors think trying to choose stocks that will outperform the broad market is extremely difficult, if not impossible. As a result, index investors buy small stakes of hundreds of companies, so that trouble at any one firm won’t hurt much.

Index investors may often say fundamental analysis is a waste of time. Even 
so, many index investors apply some aspects of fundamental analysis. For instance, index investors routinely choose to invest in baskets of either value

Chunk 344 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
stocks or growth stocks. Value stocks are those that are largely ignored by investors and command low stock prices relative to their fundamentals, such as profits or asset values. Growth stocks, on the other hand, are the darlings of Wall Street and demand huge stock prices compared to their fundamentals.
In addition, index investors regularly parcel money between shares of large 
companies and small companies. These measures of size, again, are rooted in fundamental analysis.

Chunk 345 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
You’ll notice that even an index investor might boost returns by paying atten-
tion to fundamental factors. If you want to measure a company’s market value, you’ll need its number of shares outstanding, which comes from the balance sheet. Likewise, a stock’s book value comes from its balance sheet. 
Assisting technical analysts

Chunk 346 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Assisting technical analysts
Like fundamental analysts, technical analysts think they can beat the stock market by picking the right stocks at the right time. But unlike fundamental analysis, technical analysis calls for a close study of stock price movements over time. Why the “three factors” matter 
It’s rare that academic research can make you money. But one of the most influential pieces of academic research ever written about invest-ing is certainly worth your time.

Chunk 347 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French 
found that nearly 95 percent of stock price movements are explained by just three things, two of which are determined by a company’s fundamentals. The three factors that move stocks are: 
 ✓ Market risk:  Movements of the broad econ-
omy have a large sway on how individual

Chunk 348 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
omy have a large sway on how individual 
stocks perform. ✓ Size: Shares of smaller companies mea-sured by market value tend to beat the stock market, in part, because they are riskier and less established. Market value, also called market capitalization or market cap, mea-sures the total price Wall Street assigns to a company by multiplying a stock price by the total number of its shares outstanding. You can find out more about market capital-ization later in this chapter.

Chunk 349 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Price or value: The lower a stock’s price, relative to its book value, the better it tends to do relative to the rest of the stock market. Book value is a key aspect of fundamental analysis, as you’ll read about in Chapter 8. 
07 506455-ch03.indd   4007 506455-ch03.indd   40 9/24/09   10:06:41 PM9/24/09   10:06:41 PM41  Chapter 3: Gaining an Upper Hand on Wall Street
Still, technical analysts can benefit from fundamental analysis, too. For instance,

Chunk 350 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
some technical analysts might look for companies that are increasing their revenue or earnings growth each quarter. This information is found on a com-pany’s income statement. Similarly, technical analysts might look for the best company in an industry by looking for companies with the most attractive financial ratios. 
Dooming your portfolio by 
paying too much 
No matter what type of investor you are, there are several absolutes. Here’s

Chunk 351 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
one of them: If you overpay for a stock, you’re accepting a sentence of poor returns in the future. Your return on a stock is a function of how much you pay for it. By definition, the more you pay for an investment, the lower your return will be. 
Imagine you have the opportunity to buy a Laundromat. The Laundromat has

Chunk 352 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
been open for 30 years, and in each of those years, it generates a profit of $100,000. Since the Laundromat is in a strip mall that will close in five years, you figure the business will generate $500,000 in profit over the years and then will be shut down. 
 To keep this example simple, forget about the role of inflation, or the decreas-
ing value of money each year, at this point. Also assume that your estimate 
was correct, and the Laundromat generated $100,000 a year in profit.

Chunk 353 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Just imagine what would happen if you offered to buy this Laundromat 
for $200,000. Your gain would be 150%. You know this because your profit is $300,000 because that’s the difference between the Laundromat’s earn-ings ($500,000) and what you paid ($200,000). Your return is your profit of $300,000 divided by the price you paid, $200,000. 
Now, what if you got into a bidding war with another person interested in

Chunk 354 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
buying the Laundromat? In the heat of the moment, you offered to buy the business for $400,000 instead of $200,000. Your return will take a big hit, now equaling 50%. Nothing changed with the Laundromat. It will function the same whether you paid $400,000 or $200,000. But your return is now the same profit of $300,000 divided by your purchase price of $400,000. 
The same goes for investments, including stocks and bonds. If you increase the

Chunk 355 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
amount you pay for a share of stock, for instance, you eat into your return. 
07 506455-ch03.indd   4107 506455-ch03.indd   41 9/24/09   10:06:41 PM9/24/09   10:06:41 PM42 Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
 Overpaying for a stock is even more dangerous than increasing your offer for

Chunk 356 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the Laundromat. If a company you invest in suffers a slowdown and its earn-ings are smaller than expected, you’ll find your return to be very small, or you may not get back what you invested. 
Sitting through short-term volatility

Chunk 357 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Sitting through short-term volatility 
Sometimes the excitement of daily market activity can get intoxicating. Ticker symbols scrolling at the bottom of the TV screen during financial shows can make you feel as if the markets are constantly moving and changing. And that’s true; markets are constantly moving as investors trade shares back and forth and push stock prices up and down. 
But a fundamental analysis can help you block out a great deal of this noise

Chunk 358 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
and be a better investor as a result. An example is perhaps with your house. Imagine buying a home for $200,000, which you know is worth that much. After having an appraiser look at the condition of the roof, remodeled kitchen and bath as well as looking at the prices of identical homes in the area, you have a pretty good idea of what the house is worth. 
With this in mind, would you panic if you were sitting on the patio while a

Chunk 359 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
person walking by randomly offered you $100,000 for the home? Probably not. After all, you know the home is worth more than $100,000. Besides, you’re not in the market to sell anyway. 
Still, that’s what stock investors commonly do when they pay too much atten-
tion to day-to-day movements in stock prices. They may have felt great about buying a stock for $10 a share, but if the stock falls to $8 a month later, they panic and wonder if they should sell.

Chunk 360 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
One of the mantras of fundamental analysis comes from Benjamin Graham, the 
pioneer of the methods and mentor to Warren Buffett. Fundamental analysts will often say the market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long run. In other words, stock prices can be kicked dramati-cally higher or lower in the short term. But over the longer term, the underly-ing value of a company will prevail, and its true heft will be recognized.

Chunk 361 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Fundamental analysis helps you focus on a investment’s true value, or weight, 
using Benjamin Graham’s analogy. If you know you correctly analyzed a company and assigned the correct value to it, then you don’t need to be as concerned about whether or not a company is popular or not in any given day, month, or year. Having a fundamental grasp of a company gives you the peace of mind to hold an investment for a long period of time and resist the urge to sell at the wrong time.

Relying on the Basic Info the Pros Use
It’s natural to think successful fundamental analysts have some kind of secret

Chunk 363 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
that’s beyond the reach of regular investors. Looking at the long-term suc-cess of Warren Buffett, for instance, makes you think perhaps he has a super-computer that’s able to forecast the future. Similarly, many analysts who study companies have deep insights about their businesses, which might lead you to think they have access to data you don’t.
But here’s the truth. Fundamental analysts, with a few exceptions, are using

Chunk 364 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
all the same financial statements you have access to. Even the professionals are looking at all the same things I’ll show you in this book such as: 
 ✓ The financial statements: The income statement, balance sheet, state-ment of cash flows and ratios are the cornerstone of the analysis done by most fundamental analysts.

Chunk 365 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ The financial ratios: These seemingly simple calculations put the num-bers in the financial statements into perspective. That perspective helps you determine if stocks are cheap or expensive. 
 ✓ Industry analysis: Understanding the dynamics of the industry a com-pany is in can help you do a better job investing.

Chunk 366 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Economic analysis: Investments can swing in value based largely on how the broad economy is doing. The influence of the economy became clear in 2008, when shares of companies having nothing to do with sub-prime loans were dragged down with the financial debacle. 
 Clearly, the pros do have distinct advantages. The large firms may employ

Chunk 367 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
armies of research experts to pore over the financial statements, allowing them to trade while you’re still downloading the results. And some of the pro-fessional systems make fundamental analysis easier by automatically calculat-ing growth trends and the financial ratios. Finally, experience can be a big help in helping a fundamental analyst spot things that a beginner might miss. 
What is the “Warren Buffett Way”?

Chunk 368 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
What is the “Warren Buffett Way”?
For many fundamental analysts, Warren Buffett is the ultimate role model. And there’s no denying his success. For instance, shares of Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway rose from $70,000 a share to $96,600 in the ten years ending December 2008 — an impressive 38% gain. During that same time period, the Russell 3000 index, which measures the performance of the stock market

in general, lost 0.8% in value including dividends, according to Russell 
Investments. His longer-term record is strong, too. No wonder Buffett is called the Oracle of Omaha. 
Trying to figure out Buffett’s secret is the investment world’s equivalent of

Chunk 370 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the search for the Holy Grail. Scores of investors make the pilgrimage to Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meetings in Omaha each year, trying to figure out how Buffett does it. Hour-long lunches with Buffett auction off on eBay for hundreds of thousands of dollars. And there are countless books on Buffett, most notably The Warren Buffett Way (Wiley). 
Interestingly, though, Buffett doesn’t make much of a secret of his techniques.

Chunk 371 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Every year, in his letter to shareholders and also in Berkshire Hathaway’s “Owner’s Manual” he paints a picture of his approach. And much of his approach is based in key elements of fundamental analysis, including:

Chunk 372 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Invest as an owner, not a trader. Buffett is very clear that he looks at an investment not as a short-term trade, but a long-term relationship. Berkshire Hathaway will often invest in a company and hold it for a very long time, perhaps never selling the position. “Regardless of price, we have no interest at all in selling any good businesses that Berkshire owns,” according to Berkshire’s Owner’s Manual.

Chunk 373 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Consider carefully a company’s intrinsic value. Buffet repeatedly dis-cusses intrinsic value, which is a measure of what a company is truly worth. Intrinsic value is how much cash a company is expected to generate over its lifetime, which is a good measure of what it’s worth. Buying a stock for less than its intrinsic value gives you a bit of a margin of safety. You’ll find out how to calculate a company’s intrinsic value in Chapter 11.

Chunk 374 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Analyze management. Buffett routinely says even a seemingly ho-hum company can generate dazzling returns with a good management team at the helm. For that reason, Buffett will often leave the top officers and directors of a company in place, even after buying a company.

Chunk 375 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Stick with businesses you understand. The better you grasp how a com-pany makes its money and operates, the more informed you’ll be after reviewing its financial statements. You’ll also know better what to look for, since every industry and company has unique financial traits.

Chunk 376 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Find businesses that have a real advantage. In capitalism, if a company has a good idea, other firms will try to copy it and steal away market share. Buffett combats that by investing in businesses with a strong brand or unique product, such as Coca-Cola. 
07 506455-ch03.indd   4407 506455-ch03.indd   44 9/24/09   10:06:42 PM9/24/09   10:06:42 PM45  Chapter 3: Gaining an Upper Hand on Wall Street
Investors who want to ride Buffett’s coattails could just invest in Berkshire

Chunk 377 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Hathaway. But given his successful long-term investing record, it’s not surpris-ing there’s an industry out of helping investors mimic him. There are more than 4,000 books with Buffett’s name in the title, according to Amazon.com. 
Others try to mimic what Buffett does. There’s a mutual fund called the

Chunk 378 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Wisdom Fund, which attempts to mirror Buffett’s investments. Still others try to figure out what Buffett is investing in by reading Berkshire Hathaway’s annual report, a document that discloses all the firm’s large holdings. 
It’s never a good idea to blindly buy stocks just because another investor did.

Chunk 379 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Still, reviewing the stocks that pass Buffett’s fundamental analysis might be a good place to start. The list of Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings in publicly traded companies can be found at www.buffettsecrets.com.
 Blindly following moves of top investors isn’t an instant route to riches. That’s

Chunk 380 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
especially the case when trying to take cues from Buffett. Buffett constantly reminds his shareholders that he plans to hold investments for a long time. And his holdings can also suffer large losses. For instance, had you bought Tesco at the beginning of 2008 after seeing it was a top holding at the end of 2007, you would have suffered a 75% loss.
Checking in on Graham and Dodd

Chunk 381 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Checking in on Graham and Dodd 
As much as Buffett is revered and admired, he, too was a student of funda-mental analysis. Buffett has utilized and perfected the tools of professors Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, who are discussed at more length below. Graham and Dodd, whose names are synonymous with a method of investing called value investing, trace their roots to Columbia University, which Buffett attended. 
The origins of value investing

Chunk 382 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The origins of value investing
Value investing, along with the work of Graham and Dodd, is usually central to the work of fundamental analysis. Graham and Dodd explained that a stock is really a claim on the cash a company is expected to generate in the future, or its intrinsic value, as referred to above. Just know that if a stock is trading for: 
 ✓ Less than the cash it will generate, then it’s undervalued and may be bought.

Chunk 383 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ More than the value of cash a company is expected to churn out, it’s overvalued.

Using fundamentals to see when a stock is priced right
But Graham and Dodd took things a bit further than just weighing whether 
stocks were over or undervalued. Other lessons from Graham and Dodd worth noting include:

Chunk 384 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Protecting yourself. Buy stocks well below what they are worth, or their intrinsic value. This extra cushion gives you a margin of safety in case the business runs into trouble and the stock price falls further.

Chunk 385 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Investing isn’t necessarily speculating. While it’s tempting to think of Wall Street as a giant casino, Graham and Dodd explained that wasn’t necessarily the case. If you’re buying stocks with little information about the companies’ business, then yes, you’re betting or speculating. When you speculate, you bet you can sell the stock to someone else for more. But with fundamental analysis, you can become more of an investor by understanding what you paid and what you can expect to receive in

Chunk 386 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
you paid and what you can expect to receive in exchange.

Chunk 387 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Being cautious of companies with excessive debt. Companies that borrow heavily to finance their operations may face onerous debt pay-ments during difficult economies. 
Figuring Out When to Buy or Sell a Stock

Chunk 388 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Most investors are frustrated by the difficulty of getting the timing just right. Even professional investors complain that while it’s hard enough trying to find the right investment and buy it at a good price, it’s even harder to know when to sell. Fundamental analysis can help you with this because you’ll learn how to estimate what a company is worth. As discussed above, know-ing what a company is worth is very helpful, since you’ll know whether the current stock price is higher or lower than

Chunk 389 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the current stock price is higher or lower than what you think the company’s value is.

Chunk 390 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
On the flip side, the discipline of fundamental analysis can help you evaluate 
when you might want to sell a stock. If a stock price is well below what you think the stock is worth, why would you sell at that price unless you had to? 
Looking beyond the per-share price

Chunk 391 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Looking beyond the per-share price
Many investors get obsessed with the per-share price of a stock. It’s easy to understand why. When you buy a slice of pizza, for instance, you might not think to calculate how much, based on the per-slice price, how much you’re paying for the entire pie. 
07 506455-ch03.indd   4607 506455-ch03.indd   46 9/24/09   10:06:42 PM9/24/09   10:06:42 PM47  Chapter 3: Gaining an Upper Hand on Wall Street

Chunk 392 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But one of the basic premises of fundamental investing is just that. You want 
to know how much you’re paying for your slice of a company, and how that compares to what it’s really worth. And if there’s one aspect of fundamental analysis you can use immediately from this chapter, it’s that the per-share price of a stock, by itself, doesn’t tell you much. 
 Just looking at a company’s per-share price can lead you to make incorrect

Chunk 393 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
judgments. Some investors, for instance, have puzzled over how shares of Visa could trade for less than $60 a share while rival MasterCard commands a price of more than $160 a share, since Visa processes more credit card trans-actions than MasterCard does. You might assume Visa is a better value than MasterCard, especially since MasterCard is a smaller company than Visa in terms of revenue. You will learn more about using revenue to compare the sizes of companies in Chapter 6.

Fundamental analysis, though, will show you that Visa’s lower per-share price

Chunk 395 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
doesn’t mean it’s a screaming buy. And that’s due to the use of market value, perhaps the most basic thing fundamental analysts consider. Market value tells you how much investors are paying for an entire company based on the price of the single share of stock. Using the pizza metaphor, market value tells you what the price of the whole pizza is, based on the price of one slice. You can apply this information immediately to stocks, by using this formula:

Chunk 396 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Market value = share price ×  number of shares outstanding
The key parts of market value are: 
 ✓ Share price: How much investors are willing to pay for a slice of own-ership in a company. You can get a company’s share price from many sources, ranging from your online brokerage firm, investing Web sites or in the business section of your newspaper.

Chunk 397 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Number of shares outstanding: The number of slices, or shares, a com-pany’s value is cut into. The number of shares outstanding is available in a company’s balance sheet, as described more fully in Chapter 6. 
Applying market value to Visa and MasterCard reveals much more than simply looking at their share prices does. The analysis shows that despite its lower per-share price, Visa is actually the company with the bigger total value. You figure this out by: 
Calculating market value of Visa:

Chunk 398 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Calculating market value of Visa:
$60 a share price ×  846 million shares = $50.8 billion 
Calculating market value of MasterCard:$160 a share price ×  129.2 million shares = $20.7 billion

You can see that investors are in fact paying a greater amount for Visa than

Chunk 399 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
MasterCard. Whether or not they’re paying too much is another question and something you can explore in more detail in Chapter 8. But at this point, it’s important to understand how fundamental analysis goes well beyond just taking a look at a company’s share price. 
Seeing how a company’s fundamentals and 
its price may get out of alignment
You don’t need a long memory to remember how fundamental analysis could

Chunk 400 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
have helped your investing. During the tech-stock boom of the late 1990s, investors were so enamored with dot-coms, they were willing to pay bound-less amounts for them. And just a few years later, in the mid-2000s, a housing boom drove up shares of homebuilders’ stocks. What’s remarkable is that there were two massive bubbles in just one decade. Fundamental analysis could have helped you sidestep the intense pain after both these bubbles inevitably burst.

Chunk 401 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Academics argue over why bubbles and manias occur with investing. And 
you can leave that heady discussion to them. Just know that sometimes, over-enthusiasm for stocks can drive their prices, albeit temporarily, to levels that aren’t justified by their underlying businesses. Fundamental analysis is one way to try to see when a bubble is forming and try to profit from it.
 Even masters of fundamental analysis have difficulty timing bubbles just

Chunk 402 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
right. Many analysts had warned that tech-stocks were overvalued in 1998, for instance. These investors had to bear being wrong and missing out on huge gains as tech stocks continued to soar in 1999 and early 2000. 
Investors who pay attention to company fundamentals are often able to at

Chunk 403 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
least recognize when a bubble is forming. Weak fundamentals, for instance, were the tip-off for the dot-com bubble. More than a third of the 109 Internet companies that failed had business models that didn’t bring in enough revenue or had costs too high to ever make a profit, according to Boston Consulting. 
Fundamental analysis can help you recognize when stocks are rising too

Chunk 404 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
much, well beyond what’s justified by their businesses. Investors will often become charmed by story stocks, or companies that seem to have bound-less potential. Consider the rise of satellite radio. Like many investment ideas based on promise, the story was irresistible. Subscribers fed up with 
07 506455-ch03.indd   4807 506455-ch03.indd   48 9/24/09   10:06:42 PM9/24/09   10:06:42 PM49  Chapter 3: Gaining an Upper Hand on Wall Street

Chunk 405 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
commercial-filled FM radio were rushing to sign up for monthly subscriptions 
that gave them thousands of crystal-clear radio stations from satellites. Even automakers were installing satellite radio players in cars. The growth of satel-lite radio companies looked unstoppable in 2000. 
And most investors certainly took the bait. Sirius Satellite Radio’s stock

Chunk 406 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
soared, racing to the point where it had a market value of $1.9 billion in 2000. While the company was losing money, it told investors customers were sign-ing up at a rapid clip and that subscription fees would roll in. Meanwhile, the company continued to heavily spend on costly items, including paying personality Howard Stern $100 million a year for five years, plus issuing him nearly $200 million in stock. Investors continued to buy in.

Chunk 407 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But eventually, the investors who took the time to read the company’s finan-
cial statements with horror were proven right. Eventually, Sirius bought rival XM Satellite in 2008, for form Sirius XM Radio, with hopes that it could gain an advantage through being larger. Still, fundamental analysts spotted two signs they routinely look for, including:

Chunk 408 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Lack of profit: Even as the company grew, it continued to lose more and more money. Losses at the company continued to surge, swelling from $226 million in 2003 to $5.2 billion during the twelve months ended September 2008. 
 ✓ Large debt burden: As of 2009, the company faced the prospect of a $1 billion pile of debt coming due. That’s the corporate equivalent of your mortgage lender telling you that you have to pay your entire mort-gage balance back next year.

Chunk 409 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Despite the glowing promises of the company, investors ended up suffering as those promises didn’t pan out. The company’s stock price collapsed 99% from the high in 2000 to less than 20 cents a share in February, as Sirius XM flirted with bankruptcy until receiving a costly bailout from Liberty Media. Fundamental analysis proved correct. 
Using buy-and-hold strategies 
with fundamental analysis
You might be thinking that fundamental analysis sounds like a good idea, but

Chunk 410 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
fear that doing so might cause you to constantly change your opinion on a stock. After all, companies report their earnings each quarter, and the new data, in theory, could cause you to change your opinion on the stock. 
07 506455-ch03.indd   4907 506455-ch03.indd   49 9/24/09   10:06:42 PM9/24/09   10:06:42 PM50 Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
But fundamental analysis doesn’t require you to constantly buy and sell

Chunk 411 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
stocks. In fact, many investors tend to do their homework, buy a stock, and hold on. They realize that constantly buying and selling stocks can be hazard-ous for your portfolio because it may hurt you with: 
 ✓ Mounting trading costs: Every time you buy or sell a stock, it costs you something. Certainly, you can reduce commissions by opening an account with a deep-discount online brokerage, as described in Investing

Chunk 412 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Online For Dummies (Wiley). But the costs are still a factor, including ones you might not notice. 
  There are two prices for stocks, the bid price and the ask price. The ask

Chunk 413 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
is the price you must pay when you buy a stock. The bid is the price you get when you sell. The ask is always higher than the bid, just like the price you get for trading in a car to a dealer, the bid, is less than the price the dealer will resell the car for, or the ask. When you buy a stock, you’re paying a hidden fee, which is the difference between the bid and ask, or the spread.

Chunk 414 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Unnecessary taxes: Flipping in and out of stocks can end up making Uncle Sam rich. If you sell a stock for a profit before you’ve owned it at least a year, it’s a short-term capital gain. Short-term capital gains are taxed at your ordinary income-tax rates, which can be up to 35%. On the other hand, if you hold onto a stock for more than a year and sell it, the highest tax rate you pay is 15%. By just holding on a little longer, you can save a bundle on taxes.

Chunk 415 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Mistakes: It’s tempting to think that you’re never wrong. And after reading this book and applying fundamental analysis, you’ll be more informed than many other investors. Still, it’s easy to make a mistake if you sell too early. 
Looking to the long term

Chunk 416 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Looking to the long term
While it’s not always the case, investors who rely on fundamental analysis are often resigned to being patient. After all, when you’re counting on the fact that the stock market and its scores of traders, portfolio managers, and other investors are wrong, you can’t expect them to arrive at your way of thinking overnight. 
Fundamental analysis often works best when paired with a passive investing

Chunk 417 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
strategy. With passive investing, you do all your homework, pick your stock, 
and then wait. The stock might fall further. But it’s up to you to have the cour-age to trust your research and wait until other investors see what attracted you to the stock. 
07 506455-ch03.indd   5007 506455-ch03.indd   50 9/24/09   10:06:42 PM9/24/09   10:06:42 PM51  Chapter 3: Gaining an Upper Hand on Wall Street
And because making money with fundamental analysis requires you to go

Chunk 418 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
against the crowd, you’ll often need to buy the stock when you think others are wrong. A few of the times where stock prices might, temporarily, under-value a company include:

Chunk 419 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ The wake of an accounting scandal: When investors can no longer trust a management team because the financial statements have been falsi-fied, they might sell the stock indiscriminately. If the stock is adequately beaten down to a point where you feel the company’s not being properly appreciated, there could be opportunity. 
  Trying to buy a stock after it’s been “cooking the books” is extremely dif-

Chunk 420 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
ficult. Since fundamental analysis is based on accurate financial account-ing, making a decision based on false information is complicated and beyond the scope of this book. 
 ✓ Amid pending litigation or liability claims: Stocks will often trade at discounts, or below their true value, when investors are worried a com-pany might face massive claims. This has happened with companies involved in tobacco and asbestos.

Chunk 421 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Slowing growth: When a company matures, it may see the rate of increase in revenue and earnings slow. When that happens, growth investors,  who 
buy growth stocks, may dump the stock so they can move on to the new darling.

Chunk 422 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Industry shifts: When there’s a major disruption to an industry, the stocks in the group might get seriously punished. Following the credit crunch, for instance, stocks in the financial sector lost 58% of their value as a group in 2008. Certainly, not all banks and financial firms deserved to be punished that badly. 
Being willing to step up and invest in a company others want nothing to do with can be lucrative. Beaten-down stocks that get rediscovered by investors can rally strongly.

Chunk 423 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
For instance, investors had to be brave and confident enough to buy stock in 
Tyco in June 2002. The diversified industrial supply company was mired in a scandal pertaining to alleged accesses by its CEO, Dennis Kozlowski. But by the end of 2002, the value of the investment soared more than 250% as inves-tors figured they overestimated the trouble the company was in.

Lucent was born out of the technology arm of AT&T, which was known for innovative patents for telecommunication and computing. Lucent, considered a blue chip by many investors, routinely showed up on lists of the most popular stocks with individual investors.

They kept thinking that as the stock fell to $75, $65, and $55. But it didn’t come back. The stock collapsed to $2.34, the price at which rival Alcatel offered to buy it in 2006.

ready to start analyzing fundamental data. There’s just one little 
problem: You need to get the data first. 
Luckily, when it comes to getting your hands on data, there’s never been a 
better time to be a fundamental analyst. You’re able to get data faster, at less cost, and with less technical expertise than ever before. The ability to obtain financial data almost immediately from companies allows fundamental ana-lysts to closely monitor how a company is doing.

Getting In Sync with the 
Fundamental Calendar 
Companies you can invest in don’t get to decide whether or not to give you

Chunk 433 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
their financial information. And that’s a relief. Just imagine how haphazard it would be if companies could choose. What if they just weren’t in the mood to report their revenue or earnings in a quarter? If a retailer had a bad holiday selling season, for instance, it could tell investors, “Sorry, we’re not going to tell you how we did.” Such selective disclosure would be the corporate ver-sion of letting your kids only bring report cards home if they got all A’s.

Chunk 434 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
In reality, publicly traded companies agree to be somewhat transparent. 
Transparency is a popular buzzword in business, but it’s a noble goal. To be

Chunk 435 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
transparent, companies must adhere to strict rules about what financial infor-mation they disclose, and must even meet deadlines. And this goes for nearly all publicly traded companies, or those that sell ownership stakes of them-selves to the general public who buy the shares. Similarly, when companies borrow money from the public, they too, must disclose their financial results to the public. 
 By taking the public’s money, companies agree to give investors quarterly

Chunk 436 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
updates on their financial progress. Access to current and accurate funda-mental data is one of your most basic rights when you either invest in or lend money to a company. 
Which companies must report their 
financials to the public?
Just about any company you can invest in must follow financial reporting

Chunk 437 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
rules. That includes companies that are publicly traded, as explained above. But even some private companies, which haven’t sold stock, must provide some financial information if they have $10 million or more in assets and have 500 or more owners. 
Most major stock market exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange

Chunk 438 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
and NASDAQ, require their listed companies to provide quarterly and annual financial reports to investors. That includes foreign companies with shares of stock that trade on either exchange. 
 Some private companies offering generous stock option programs to employ-
ees often find themselves eventually having to start filing financial reports. Internet search company Google, for instance, was private for roughly six years after it was founded in 1998. The company quickly hit the $10 million

threshold for total assets, meaning it was required to provide financial state-

Kicking it all off: Earnings season

Chunk 440 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Kicking it all off: Earnings season
Sports fans wait all year for the beginning of football, basketball, or baseball season. And children can’t help but anticipate the holiday season. But it’s earnings season that fundamental analysts look forward to. 
Four times a year, shortly after the end of the quarter, companies will begin

Chunk 441 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
to report their financial results to investors. Since most companies are on a calendar year, the results generally start trickling out two weeks after the quarter ends. Four times a year, usually in January, April, July, and October, thousands of companies report their financial results en masse. These times of year are called earnings season. 
 Aluminum maker Alcoa earned the unofficial designation as the company to

Chunk 442 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
kick off earnings season. The company’s advanced accounting system allows it to close its books very rapidly following the end of the quarter. Alcoa is the first stock that’s a member of the Dow Jones industrial average to report its earnings each quarter.  
No data is bad data

Chunk 443 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
No data is bad data
If a company claims to be publicly traded but doesn’t provide financial information, be highly skeptical. The lack of financial information is especially critical when dealing with stocks that trade on the largely unregulated markets known as the Pink Sheets or OTC Bulletin Board.

Chunk 444 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Unlike regulated exchanges, like the NYSE and NASDAQ, stocks that trade on the Pink Sheets and OTC Bulletin Board are not required to provide any financial information to investors. You read that right. These companies may even have ticker symbols, but never disclose how much they made or even how much revenue they generated. Most of the stocks on these markets are lightly regulated, if at all. And the lack of financial information is a huge reason why investors, especially those who rely on

Chunk 445 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
why investors, especially those who rely on fundamental analysis, are often best served by avoiding stocks that trade on the OTC Bulletin Board or Pink Sheets. These mar-kets are infamous hangouts for so-called penny

Chunk 446 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
stocks. These stocks, which generally trade for a few pennies, are often just a name and little else. Sometimes penny-stock companies claim to have products and a management team, but don’t actually generate any money to speak of. Penny stocks are popular with speculators, who like to talk up a shell company’s prospects, get investors excited enough to buy in, and then dump the shares for a quick profit.

 Not all companies follow a calendar year. For instance, retailers generally

Chunk 448 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
bring in a vast majority of their sales each year during December. For that reason, many retailers close their books at the end of January, to give them time to tally up their performance in December and give a full report for the year. When a company ends its year, for accounting purposes in a month other than December, it’s called a fiscal year.
Getting the earnings press release
You don’t have to be a newspaper reporter to appreciate the earnings press

Chunk 449 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
release. Contrary to its name, the earnings press release is for all investors, not just the media. After the end of a quarter, companies will publicly announce their financial results by distributing the press release. The press release is usually, but not always, accompanied by a conference call for investors and analysts. During the call, the management team will go over the quarter or year, describe the information in the earnings press release, and answer ques-tions from the analysts who

Chunk 450 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
and answer ques-tions from the analysts who cover the company’s stock for research firms.

Chunk 451 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
When you read or hear a company reported its financial results, the informa-
tion almost always comes from the company’s earnings press release. While earnings press releases are technically unofficial and preliminary, they’re usu-ally accurate enough for investors, analysts, and the news media to use the numbers immediately. It’s important to remember, though, that the earnings press release is not reviewed by an accountant or auditor.

Chunk 452 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
When companies issue an earnings press release, they will often notify the 
regulators by filing a form 8-K. The 8-K filing is the official way to signal to the world that the company has released critical information. 
Regulators do not directly stipulate what companies must say in earnings 
press releases. But generally, earnings press releases contain several key parts:

Chunk 453 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Summary of the results: Most earnings press releases will give the num-bers investors want most right at the top, maybe even in the headline. That includes the revenue and earnings the company generated during the quar-ter and how much it grew (or shrunk) from the same quarter last year. 
  Be leery when a company brags about a quarter being a “record” quarter. 
Even if a company’s revenue rose to a record amount, its costs may have also run out of control and eaten into its earnings.

Chunk 454 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Management comment: A member of the management team will usually opine on how the quarter went. As you might imagine, these statements are generally very carefully crafted, overly optimistic, and not particu-larly useful. 
 ✓ Description of major business events during the year: Companies might break down — and even provide succinct bullet points — of the major accomplishments during the period.

Chunk 455 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
08 506455-ch04.indd   5608 506455-ch04.indd   56 9/24/09   10:17:10 PM9/24/09   10:17:10 PM57  Chapter 4: Getting Your Hands on Fundamental Data
 ✓ Guidance for the future: Most companies will often provide earnings 
guidance, or an estimate on how much the company might earn in the upcoming year. This guidance is important since it lets you know what the company expects in the near future.

Chunk 456 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Financial statements: The earnings press release is the first glimpse investors will get of the company’s income statement and balance sheet. These statements are among the most critical documents for fundamen-tal data you’ll get. 
 It’s a good idea, when reading an earnings press release, to bypass most

Chunk 457 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
everything except the financial statements. While earnings press releases are intended to be honest representations of a company’s performance, compa-nies use the first parts of the earnings press release to put their performance in the best light. In contrast, the financial statements are the purest and least-biased parts of the press release.
Bracing for the 10-Q

Chunk 458 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Bracing for the 10-Q
Following the earnings press release, the next document to trickle from the company is the 10-Q. The 10-Q is the official financial report submitted by a company to summarize its performance during the quarter. 
Most companies have 40 days from the end of each fiscal quarter to produce 
and provide the 10-Q to investors. Generally, companies file the 10-Q a week or two after they provide the earnings press release.

Chunk 459 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Both the earnings press release and 10-Q serve the same basic purpose: They 
tell investors how the company did, financially, during the quarter. But since the 10-Q is written primarily to satisfy regulatory requirements, it’s usually much more straightforward and contains less spin. 
The 10-Q must be filed with the chief regulator of the financial markets, the SEC. 
As a result, companies are careful to include the following key components:

Chunk 460 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Financial statements: Companies don’t waste any time getting straight to the point with the 10-Q. The key financial statements are presented right at the top, while they’re usually at the bottom of earnings press releases. 
  Don’t make the mistake of assuming since you read the earnings press

Chunk 461 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
release, you don’t need to bother with the 10-Q. A vast majority of com-panies don’t include a statement of cash flows in the earnings press release. The statement of cash flows, however, must be included in the 10-Q. As you’ll discover in Chapter 7, the statement of cash flows is an extremely important document used in financial analysis.

some financial information doesn’t slip nicely into the financial state-ments. Unusual or noteworthy financial events might require more description than will fit into the financial statements, and those are available in the footnotes.

Chunk 463 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Never skip the footnotes. Companies will often throw items in the foot-
notes, hoping you’ll miss them as an investor. Enron, for instance, stuffed much of the information about its cryptic partnerships in the footnotes.

Chunk 464 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition: This sec-tion of the 10-Q is usually called the MD&A. In the MD&A, management steps investors through its financial results for the quarter. The narra-tive is usually stripped down and, well, straightforward since executives know the SEC will review it. So they don’t want to say anything that may haunt them later.

Chunk 465 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Controls and procedures: The company will let investors know if they found any problems in the way they monitor their accounting and pres-ent the information to investors. Following the accounting scandal at Enron, new rules from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 forced companies to make sure they had adequate controls in place over their accounting.

Chunk 466 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Other information: Here, companies can throw in other material that might be of note to investors. This may include any pending litigation or whether the company sold additional stock, or is having trouble paying interest on its debt. 
Many investors don’t realize a company’s 10-Q is not officially audited by a third-party accounting firm. That doesn’t mean you can’t necessarily trust the numbers; just know a little more skepticism isn’t a bad idea. 
Running through the 10-K

Chunk 467 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
If you’ve ever run a 10-K race, you know that it can be pretty grueling if you haven’t trained properly. The same goes for companies looking to report their annual financial performance in the form called the 10-K. This docu-ment is a monster, and producing it is one of the biggest financial chores a company faces. It’s also the most comprehensive piece of fundamental data you’ll get as an investor. Most companies are required to release their 10-K fil-ings within 75 days from the end of their

Chunk 468 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
fil-ings within 75 days from the end of their fiscal year. Some smaller companies, though, have 90 days to comply with the rules.

Chunk 469 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Due to the complexity of producing a 10-K, there can be a significant delay between the end of the calendar year and the time the report gets released. 
08 506455-ch04.indd   5808 506455-ch04.indd   58 9/24/09   10:17:10 PM9/24/09   10:17:10 PM59  Chapter 4: Getting Your Hands on Fundamental Data
The 10-K is kind of like a company’s annual review. The level of detail of the

Chunk 470 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
10-K is exhaustive, and unless you know what you’re looking for, it’s easy to get lost in the hundreds of pages of tables and text. 
That’s why fundamental analysts rarely curl up with a 10-K and read it from 
start to finish like a novel. They just know how to skip around in a 10-K and look for these key elements: 
 ✓ Everything in the 10-Q, just for the whole year:  All the data you get in

Chunk 471 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the 10-Q for the quarter, you get for the year in the 10-K. That includes the financial statements and legal proceedings, but also, a more expanded MD&A where the management team explains more fully how the year progressed. The controls and procedures section may also be more fleshed out, since the 10-K has been checked over by the auditors.

Chunk 472 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Changes in accounting and disagreements with accountants: You might not expect to see conflict and intrigue in a company’s financial report, but sometimes you can find it here. Companies and their accountants will state in this section whether or not they didn’t see eye to eye on financial reporting matters.

Chunk 473 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Long-term financial data: Companies give you the financial results for the year that just ended. But you’ll also find data for the past three, five, or even ten years. These data are very useful when looking for trends, or 
changes in fundamentals like revenue and earnings.

Chunk 474 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Business summary: Here, the company lays out the nitty-gritty of what it does for a living. The company may break down its major business units and even, in some cases, tell you which parts of the business are the most profitable. You’ll find out how to study the profitability of a com-pany’s units in Chapter 5.

Chunk 475 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Risk factors: Imagine showing up to pick up a date, but before you leave for the movies, he or she sits you down with a huge list of everything that’s wrong with themselves. That’s what companies must do in their 10-Ks. If there’s a known factor that could impair a company’s fundamen-tals, it is required to tell you about it here.

Chunk 476 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Auditor’s opinion: Close to the bottom of the 10-K, the accountants will need to sign off on the books to indicate they reasonably reflect the financial condition of the firm. 
 When reviewing a 10-K, always read the auditor’s opinion. The statement from

Chunk 477 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the auditor can be telling. While an auditor may not wave a red flag and tell you not to buy stock, you can read between the lines. For instance, if you see the word qualified, watch out. That means the auditor has some issues with the way the books are kept, so you should too. Also, be careful when an audi-tor says a company may not be able to remain a going concern. That’s account-

Flipping through the annual report
If you visit a CEO’s office, you’ll surely see the annual report sitting on the

Chunk 479 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
coffee table. And to be sure, many companies’ annual reports are gorgeous, well, as much as financial documents can be. The annual report is essen-tially the 10-K, magazine-style. There are lovely photos of smiling executives, employees, and customers. Even the financial statements are given a face-lift, usually printed on luxurious paper using an elegant font. The annual report is usually released several months after the 10-K is published, often landing around the time companies have their

Chunk 480 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
landing around the time companies have their shareholders’ meetings.

Chunk 481 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Unlike the 10-Q and 10-K, which you can download directly from the SEC’s Web 
site, the annual report is a paper-based document. If you call a company, most times it will be happy to mail you a copy. You can also usually view an electronic form of the paper annual report by downloading it from the company’s Web site. 
The annual report is the glossy and slick version of the 10-K. Companies pro-
duce the annual report mainly to hand out to employees and customers while courting them.

Chunk 482 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The annual report is the management team’s opportunity to put its spin on 
how the year went. Most annual reports, for instance, begin with a letter to shareholders that is generally very hopeful, even after a dismal year. Annual reports: A corporate beauty contest

Chunk 483 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Some companies go to great expense creating visually stunning annual reports. Some truly are wonders of publishing, putting some maga-zines to shame. Surfwear maker Quiksilver, for instance, produces annual reports containing full-color photos of surfers, exotic beaches, and colorful surfboards. By contrast, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway’s is a boring-looking document with no photos, but packed with wisdom and worth a read even if you don’t own the stock.

Chunk 484 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Yet other companies try to make a state-

Chunk 485 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
ment with their annual reports. Starbucks, for instance, in 2007 only put out a six-page full-color annual report that was then bundled with a black-and-white printout of its 10-K. It said its sparse annual report was an effort to reduce paper waste. In fact, thinning annual reports is a growing trend as companies look to cut costs. Companies may produce just a few col-orful pages, and slip the 10-K inside. This trend, which really began in 2006, will likely continue as more investors prefer to

Chunk 486 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
will likely continue as more investors prefer to download compa-nies’ financial information electronically.

Chunk 487 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

There’s no proxy like the proxy statement
If you’re looking for the most salacious statement released by companies,

Chunk 488 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
that must be the proxy statement. The proxy statement is a document the SEC requires companies to distribute to shareholders ahead of the annual share-holder meeting. It’s kind of like the absentee ballot you might get prior to a presidential election. 
Shareholder meetings happen every year as companies gather shareholders,

Chunk 489 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
usually in the spring, to go over their initiatives and goals. The proxy is some-times known by its regulatory name, 14A, named after the portion of the SEC rules that stipulate what it must contain. 
The proxy statement is fascinating reading because it lays out all the most 
sensitive information most companies have to offer, including: 
 ✓ Executive compensation: Not only are the annual salaries of the top executives spelled out, but the amounts of their bonuses, too.

Chunk 490 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Corporate matters subject to a vote: Companies’ proxies contain a sec-tion that looks almost like a ballot. There will be a number of measures that require shareholder approval. Usually, the items up for a vote include the selection of the auditing firm, and the board members stand-ing for reelection on the board.

Chunk 491 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Shareholder proposals: If a company has any ill will with shareholders, it will become very clear in the proxy. Dissident shareholders may offer proposals to replace the management team. Other investors might lobby for the company to adopt more environmentally friendly manufacturing.

Chunk 492 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Related-party transactions: This is one of my favorite parts of the proxy. It shows whether any of the company’s officers or directors have busi-ness relationships with it. Individuals that have business relationships with the company, in theory, may have trouble being impartial since there’s a potential conflict of interest.
 The proxy is so important to fundamental analysis that you can explore it 
more fully in Chapter 9.
Getting up to Speed with the 
Basic Accounting and Math

Chunk 493 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Basic Accounting and Math
Even if you hated math in high school and avoided accounting in college, 
you can still put fundamental analysis to use. In fact, the more you dig into 
08 506455-ch04.indd   6108 506455-ch04.indd   61 9/24/09   10:17:10 PM9/24/09   10:17:10 PM62 Part I: What Fundamental Analysis Is and Why You Should Use It 
the financials of companies and see how math and accounting can help you,

Chunk 494 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
who knows, maybe you’ll get curious to learn more. And if that’s the case, you might look into Business Math For Dummies (Wiley) or Accounting For Dummies (Wiley). 
But here, in this section, I’ll give you the basics of what you need to know 
about the concept of accounting. You’ll see that accounting is really just a way to condense millions of individual business transactions down to a form that makes it possible for you to analyze.

Chunk 495 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
When you’re studying financial statements, just remember there are three 
primary functions of business you’re trying to analyze: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. 
Finding smooth operators
A company’s operations get the most attention. Typically, when you hear a company is or is not “doing well,” that is a reference to the firm’s operating activities. 
Simply stated, a company’s operations are the process of converting raw

Chunk 496 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
materials into products that are, hopefully, sold to customers for a profit. Many elements go into operations, including effective new product develop-ment, which generates revenue, in addition to cost control, marketing, and manufacturing. The income statement, explored more in Chapter 5, lets you see how well a company is operating.
You have to spend money to make money

Chunk 497 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
You have to spend money to make money
Unless they’ve found a goose that lays platinum eggs, all companies, at some point, must put money back into their business. Equipment used to make products wears out and needs to be replaced. Companies outgrow their head-quarters and must acquire a bigger building. And it’s common for companies to overhaul their computer systems to keep up with tracking their business. 
When companies spend money to make more money, they’re investing in

Chunk 498 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
their future. And while investing is a necessary part of doing business, it can 
also be done poorly. Companies might spend too much for equipment they didn’t need. Or worse, they might over expand, resulting in a glut of their product, which hurts their profits. You can read more about profit margins in Chapter 5. There are two key things for a fundamental analyst to monitor when it comes to investment:

Chunk 499 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
08 506455-ch04.indd   6208 506455-ch04.indd   62 9/24/09   10:17:11 PM9/24/09   10:17:11 PM63  Chapter 4: Getting Your Hands on Fundamental Data
 ✓ Is the return on the investment adequate? If a company is spending 
money to expand, and revenue and profit aren’t growing too, you might be throwing your money down the drain as an investor.

Chunk 500 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Is the company using the equipment it has bought? In business, having too much capacity is not a good idea. You don’t want to spend money renting a warehouse, for instance, if it’s usually empty. 
Getting in tune with high finance
So, you can understand how a company operates and how much it’s spend-ing on itself. But who’s going to pay for all this stuff? That’s the final and criti-cal element that accounting helps you with.

Chunk 501 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Generally speaking, companies can finance, or fund their operations, in 
two ways. They can either rustle up investors, or they can borrow money. Investors provide money, called equity capital, to companies in exchange for a piece of the company. If all goes well, the company operates extremely well, profits soar, and investors are very happy since their share of the company will be worth more. When you buy stock in a company, you are an investor.

Chunk 502 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Some beginning investors incorrectly think money they use when buying a 
stock goes directly to the company. That’s not usually the case. Companies sell their stock to the public once, in a process called an initial public offering, or IPO. When those shares sell for that first time, the companies get that money. But after the IPO, the company doesn’t get additional cash. The shares and money are trading hands between other investors in the secondary market.

Chunk 503 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
When it comes to financing itself, a company may also look to borrow money. Companies may borrow money from a local bank or sell IOUs, called bonds, 
to the public. Investors who lend money to a company just want to get their money back, plus an amount of interest agreed upon ahead of time.
 If a company fails, investors and lenders are treated very differently. And the 
difference has a big influence on whether or not you decide to buy a company’s stock or bond.

Chunk 504 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
If a company is unable to keep paying interest to its lenders, the company

Chunk 505 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
goes into default. Typically, at that point, the bondholders take control of the company. In the worst-case scenario, when a company cannot be saved, bondholders get repaid first. So, let’s say a company defaulted and had a giant garage sale to sell its desks and chairs. The money would be used to pay back debt holders before stock investors see a penny. That means, as stock investors, you’re accepting the possibility that you can lose your entire investment.

Chunk 506 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

Learning a key fundamental math skill: 
Percentage changes
If you’ve noticed so far, I’ve tried to spare you from much ugly math in the 
first couple of pages. And hoping not to scare you off, I try to introduce math topics in this book gently and only when it’s relevant.

Chunk 507 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But there’s one math skill that you’ll encounter so frequently in fundamental 
analysis, you might as well tackle it now. And that’s the concept of percentage

Chunk 508 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
change. Because fundamental analysis is infatuated with looking at increases and decreases in business factors, such as sales and revenues, the percent-age change is a way to put gains and declines into context. For instance, if I told you that the price of a sweater rose $50 this year, that doesn’t tell you much. But if I told you the price was $50 before, then you know that the price doubled to $100. 
You calculate a percentage change this way: 
New number – old number ÷ old number ×  100

Chunk 509 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
New number – old number ÷ old number ×  100
Going back to the sweater example, the new price is $100 and the old price 
was $50, so: 
100 – 50 ÷ 50 ×  100 = 100%
 If a value rises by 100%, then it has doubled. Similarly, if a number rises 
by 200%, it has tripled and 300%, quadrupled. Some make the mistake, for instance, of seeing the 2 in the 200% and saying it has doubled when it has in fact, tripled. 
How to Get the Fundamental 
Data You Need

Chunk 510 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
How to Get the Fundamental 
Data You Need
You might have the fastest car in the neighborhood, but if you don’t have any 
gas, you’re not going to get far. So goes fundamental analysis. You might build the fanciest financial spreadsheet, but it’s not going to do you any good if you don’t have the raw financial numbers to put in it. 
Until the dawn of the Internet, getting fundamental data could be a real

Chunk 511 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
hassle. You would have to call or write a company and ask it to mail — yes, mail — its 10-K, 10-Q and annual report to you. 
08 506455-ch04.indd   6408 506455-ch04.indd   64 9/24/09   10:17:11 PM9/24/09   10:17:11 PM65  Chapter 4: Getting Your Hands on Fundamental Data
 Thankfully, the days of having to deal strictly with paper financial statements

Chunk 512 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
are over. But the skills of the fundamental analyst must keep up with the elec-tronic age. In this section, you’ll find out how to quickly, and for no cost, get your hands on the fundamental data you’ll need to complete your analysis. 
Getting acquainted with 
the SEC’s database
You can spend thousands of dollars for access to Web sites that provide fun-
damental data. But really, to get started, you don’t have to spend a dime.

Chunk 513 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The SEC’s website at www.sec.gov is a treasure trove for fundamental analy-
sis. You’ll find all the financial forms discussed above in this chapter, and then some. All the fundamental data are stored in the SEC’s Interactive Data 
Electronic Applications, or IDEA, database. You can use IDEA to look up any public company’s filings and even download the financial statements to your computer so you can do further analysis.

Chunk 514 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
You might hear or read references to the SEC’s EDGAR database. EDGAR was 
the SEC’s primary financial-form database prior to IDEA. EDGAR is still avail-able on the SEC’s site, but it’s not worth the time. IDEA can do everything EDGAR could and adds additional information. 
Step-by-step directions on accessing 
company fundamentals using IDEA
Now that you know how powerful IDEA is, it’s time to dive in and discover

Chunk 515 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
how to get what you need from it. For the example below, I’ll show you how to get the 10-Q, 10-K and proxy statement for General Electric. Just follow these steps: 
 1. Log into the SEC’s Web site at www.sec.gov.
 2. Click the “Search” link on the upper right-hand corner of the page.
 3. Enter the name of the company in the Company name blank. 
  It’s the first blank in the top of the blue-shaded box. Type in general elec-
tric for this example.

Chunk 516 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
tric for this example.
 4. Scroll down and click the Find Companies button.

 5. Choose the company name. 
  Because General Electric has separate business units, you’ll see compa-
nies like General Electric Capital Assurance Co. But you want the main 
company, so click on the red numbers to the left of where it says General Electric Co.

Chunk 517 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
6. Click on the form you want. 
  If you want GE’s 10-Q, scroll down until you see the form 10-Q listed and 
click on the “Documents” button. If you want the 10-K, choose 10-K, and the proxy is marked as 14-A.
 7. Click on the red code under the document in the first line. 
  This line should have the form under the “Type” head, which in this case 
is the 10-Q. When you’re downloading the 10-K, the line should read 10-Q.

Chunk 518 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
When you’re scrolling down through the list of forms, you might notice that 
some have a blue button that says “Voluntary Interactive Data.” These forms are presented in a special format that computers can read, called eXtensive 
Business Reporting Language or XBRL. Financial statements available in XBRL can be easily processed and downloaded. If you click on the Voluntary

Chunk 519 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Interactive Data button, you’ll be moved to an area of the SEC’s Web site that lets you view financial reports using XBRL. You can easily skip between the income statement and balance sheet without scrolling, for instance. XBRL also lets you easily download the financial statements to a spreadsheet. Since it’s not required to file using XBRL, only a handful of companies do. But that’s changing. 
 Most of the major Web portals, such as Yahoo, at finance.yahoo.com, and

Chunk 520 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
MSN, at money.msn.com, provide summaries of companies’ primary financial statements. MSN Money also lets you access all the regulatory forms. Most companies, too, put their financial data on their Web sites. But as a fundamen-tal analyst, it’s important to know how to get the data direct from the source: The SEC’s IDEA database.
Pulling fundamental data from 
Web sites into spreadsheets
Sometimes reading a company’s financial statements using the SEC’s IDEA isn’t

Chunk 521 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
enough. If you want to perform the analysis you’ll find out about in the next part of this book, you’ll likely need to download the data into a spreadsheet. 
 If the company you’re analyzing provides XBRL data, it’s easy to download 
into a spreadsheet. 
08 506455-ch04.indd   6608 506455-ch04.indd   66 9/24/09   10:17:11 PM9/24/09   10:17:11 PM67  Chapter 4: Getting Your Hands on Fundamental Data
Luckily, there’s a handy trick using Microsoft Excel all fundamental analysts

Chunk 522 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
should know about. While it’s possible to cut-and-paste the financial data from a company filing into a spreadsheet, the results can be a disorganized mess. Instead, use an Excel function that’s built to order. Here’s how: 
 1. Open the filing. 
  Find the filing you’re interested in downloading using the steps above. 
Copy the Web address from the address bar in your browser by high-lighting the address and holding the Control button and the C key.
 2. Open Microsoft Excel.

Chunk 523 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
2. Open Microsoft Excel.
 3. Instruct Excel to find the filing.
  Choose Excel’s “Data” pull-down menu, and then select Import External Data and then New Web Query.
 4. Provide the Web address of the filing. 
  Paste the filing’s address by holding down the Control button and 
choose the V key, in the address bar at the top. 
 5. Import the filing.
  Click the Import button at the bottom of the page.
 6. Select the relevant financial data.

Chunk 524 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
6. Select the relevant financial data.
  Scroll down until you see the financial data you would like to download. Click the small yellow arrow next to the data.
After you follow these steps, the financial information you want, such as the company’s income statement or balance sheet, will automatically appear in a spreadsheet. This will be a handy skill that can help you with the analysis you’d do later in the book.
Finding stocks’ dividend histories

Chunk 525 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Finding stocks’ dividend histories
Dividends are periodic cash payments some companies make to their share-holders. The dividends are paid out of the company’s cash as a way of return-ing profits to the shareholders. Dividends are a very important piece of your total return on an investment. 
 Don’t ignore dividends. These cash payments, over time, account for about

one-third of the total return investors make on the market, according to Standard & Poor’s. The remaining two-thirds of total return come from the stock price rising.

Dividends are also important ways to help value a company, as you will discover 
in Chapter 8. Companies that pay dividends generally pay them quarterly.

Chunk 527 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The best way to look up a dividend history is on the company’s Web site. 
Going back to the GE example, go to www.ge.com and click on the investor relations link at the top of the page. Next, click on the Stock Information link on the left-hand side. You’ll see a link for Dividend History, which listed GE’s dividend payments going back for nearly a decade.
Getting stock-split information

Chunk 528 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Getting stock-split information
When a company’s stock price rises dramatically and begins to approach $50 a share or more, the executives might decide to split the shares. The theory goes that some naïve investors, who read too much into a stock’s per-share price, might assume a stock trading for $50 or more is too expensive. 
In a stock split, the company cuts its share price, say in half, by cutting the

Chunk 529 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
shares into multiple shares. For instance, let’s say you own 100 shares in a stock trading for $60 a share. If the company has a 2-for-1 split, you will sud-denly have 200 shares, but they’ll be worth $30 apiece. Management feels some investors are more likely to buy stock in a company for $30 a share than $60.
 Some investors assume that a stock split is a major boon since they suddenly

Chunk 530 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
have more shares. But, as discussed in Chapter 3, the per-share price of a stock doesn’t tell you much. The value of your shares is still $6,000, whether you own 100 shares at $60 or 200 shares at $30 a share. The company’s market value also stays the same.

Digging Deep Into the Income Statement
When you invest in a company by buying its stock, you’re probably not doing 
it to be charitable. By buying shares of stock, you’re claiming a piece of the company’s future revenue and profits. If all goes well, the company will grow and your stake will become more valuable.

Companies that have issued stock on a stock market exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, or borrow money from the public, are required to issue an income statement. The income statement spells out in gory detail how the company did during each quarter and year. Fundamental analysis requires you to pay close attention to the income state-ment for any sign the company isn’t progressing as it should

Chunk 547 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Luckily for investors, the accountants have somewhat standardized the way companies must prepare the income statement. No two income statements look identical, and subtle differences can make comparing one company’s income statement with other companies’ problematic, (you can read about making comparisons more in Chapter 16). Income statements can also vary a bit depending on what line of business a company is in. Still, income state-ments tend to follow the same basic structure.

Chunk 548 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
You can dedicate a great deal of time obsessing over every nuance of financial 
statements, including the income statement. If that’s of interest to you, check out Reading Financial Reports For Dummies (Wiley), which gets into the nitty-gritty of financial reporting. In this book, though, you’ll get a look at the basic layout of the income statement and what you’ll need to do some serious fun-damental analysis. 
The basic structure of an income statement includes these items:

Chunk 549 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Revenue: This is how much money the company brought in by selling 
goods and services. Revenue is often called the “top line.”
 ✓ Cost of goods sold: It takes money to make money. Cost of goods mea-
sures what a company must spend to actually create the good or service 
sold. These are direct costs, meaning they are costs for items that may literally go into the products. Cost of goods sold, for many manufacturing

companies, is the largest single cost of doing business. For instance, with 
an automaker, the cost of goods sold might include the cost of steel used to build the cars. 
 ✓ Operating expenses: Indirect expenses are incurred by companies as

Chunk 551 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
they conduct business, but may not go directly into the product. These costs are usually necessary or important, but peripheral. These indi-rect costs are called operating expenses or better known as overhead. Operating expenses may include:
 • Marketing expenses: Include advertising and other promotional expenses.
 • Research and development: What a company spends to cook up new products or services to sell to customers.

Chunk 552 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
• Administrative expenses: Expenses connected with support staff, such as legal, human resources, and other functions that are directly tied to manufacturing the product. 
 ✓ Other income: Companies sometimes bring in money for things other 
than selling products and services. This income is recorded as other income. For instance, a company might win a legal settlement or sell a factory.
 ✓ Other expenses. Similarly to how other income doesn’t qualify as reve-

Chunk 553 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
nue, other expenses do not qualify as normal operating expenses. Other expenses might include the cost to restructure a unit of the company, paying severance to lay off employees, or depreciation — accounting for wear and tear (see the sidebar, “Appreciating depreciation”). 
 ✓ Earnings before interest and taxes. After you subtract cost of goods 
sold, operating expenses, and other expenses from revenue, what you’re left with is earnings before interest and taxes.

Chunk 554 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Interest expense. Most companies borrow money to fund their opera-
tions or to buy inventory. Here, the company discloses how much it’s paying to borrow money.
 ✓ Taxes. Companies must pay taxes too. Here, companies disclose how 
much they they paid to Uncle Sam. 
 ✓ Net income. Finally, after paying all these costs and expenses, what’s 
left is the profit, or net income. This is how much the company earned during the period, based on accounting rules or GAAP.

Chunk 555 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Ever hear a company say it used GAAP? No I don’t mean that they used 
expense accounts to buy khakis and collared shirts at a popular clothing store. Instead, I’m talking about GAAP — Generally Accepted Accounting Principles — painstakingly detailed rules that instruct companies on the right way to report results.

Taking in the Top Line: Revenue

Chunk 556 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Taking in the Top Line: Revenue
For a fundamental analyst reading an income statement, revenue is a critical 
item because it tells you how: 
 ✓ Rapidly the company is growing (or shrinking): Comparing revenue generated during a year or quarter with revenue reported in the same period a year ago can be very telling. This simple comparison tells you whether the company’s growth is on an uptrend or downtrend.

Chunk 557 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Strong demand is for a company’s products: Companies love to brag about how popular their products are. But revenue is where hype can be quantified. Strong demand for a product will show up in the revenue line, even if the company’s expenses are out of line and still losing money.

Chunk 558 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ A company ranks in sheer size next to its rivals: While there are many ways to measure a company’s size, such as number of employees, rev-enue is as good a benchmark as any other. If you want to find out which company is the biggest in a competitive field, you should always check out revenue first. 
 Fundamental analysts pay close attention to revenue for the reasons listed

Chunk 559 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
above, but there’s also reason to be skeptical. Accounting rules give compa-nies a great deal of leeway in how and when they record or “recognize” rev-enue. The most classic distortion may occur when a company books revenue before the product is actually bought or received by a customer. Regulators, for this reason, warned companies to be more conservative when booking revenue. The General Accounting Office, a unit of the government charged to study waste in both the private and public sectors,

waste in both the private and public sectors, found that improper revenue recognition was to blame for more than a third of misstated financial statements. Always be skeptical of revenue. Appreciating depreciation

Chunk 561 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Accountants normally classify depreciation as an other expense. This can sometimes be a tough thing for nonaccountants to under-stand. Depreciation is an accounting method of

Chunk 562 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
recording wear and tear on things like factories or equipment. Think of it this way. If you buy a car for $15,000, in a year’s time that car might only be worth $13,000. But while you’re out $2,000 in value, you didn’t actually have to write a check for $2,000 to anyone. The same applies to a machine a company might use to make products. The erosion of value of the machine is an expense that goes into the cost of making the product being sold.

Breaking down a company’s revenue
Most companies will provide several revenue figures. Generally, there will be

Chunk 564 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
a total revenue line that totals up the money the company brought in from all its business units. But if the company is complex, it might break total revenue down into its component parts so you can see which units are performing best. 
Due to its large size and wide array of technology businesses, International

Chunk 565 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Business Machines is a great example of how you can use the revenue line to peer deeply into a company’s operations. Below, in Table 5-1, is a breakdown of IBM’s 2008 results, to give you an idea of how digging into what makes up total revenue can be revealing about a business:

As you can see above, had you just looked at total revenue you would have missed a helpful breakdown in IBM’s business. Dissecting IBM’s revenue into units gives you several key findings, including a:

Chunk 567 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Sense of a company’s business diversification. While IBM is best known for making large corporate computer systems, in reality the company gets its revenue from a swath of technology businesses. No single line of business accounts for more than 38% of total revenue. As a fundamental analyst, this is important information because it tells you whether IBM is overly concentrated in an area of technology you’re not optimistic about. Similarly, this analysis will tell you if the company exposes

Chunk 568 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
analysis will tell you if the company exposes you to the area of technology you want to invest in. For instance, if you want to invest in technology hardware, IBM probably isn’t the best for you.

 ✓ Indication of the most important business at the company. Investors 
may not realize it, but IBM is more of a technology services firm than anything else. It got 38% of its revenue from services in 2008.

Chunk 570 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Clue of reliance on noncore businesses. Over the years, it’s common for large companies to branch into businesses that are outside their core business. Several large companies, like General Electric and General Motors, have practically spawned banks as they extend credit to cus-tomers buying their products. Straying from a core business is some-thing you, as a fundamental analyst, need to pay close attention to. With IBM, you can see the company has a financing business that provides loans

Chunk 571 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
has a financing business that provides loans to customers. However, the financing business is a very small por-tion of its total operation at about 3% of revenue.

Chunk 572 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
If you want to figure out how large a unit of a company is, divide the unit’s rev-
enue by total revenue and multiply the result by 100. Using IBM’s financing unit as an example, divide the unit’s revenue of $2.6 billion by IBM’s total revenue of $103.6 to arrive at 0.025. Multiply 0.025 by 100 to convert the result into a percentage of 2.5%. 
Keeping tabs on a company’s growth

Chunk 573 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Keeping tabs on a company’s growth
If there’s one thing many investors will agree on, it’s the importance for a company to keep growing. As the prices of raw materials rise, it’s critical for companies to keep up by increasing revenue either by raising prices or creating new products with higher price tags. Even if you’re investing in a mature industry, just looking for a stable return, you still want to see revenue increasing over time so the company’s earnings keep up with inflation.

Chunk 574 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Finding out how rapidly a company is growing is simple if you know your way 
around the income statement. Here’s what you need to know: 
 1. Download the historical revenue data. 
  You’ll first need to get your hands on the revenue data. The best way to do this is by downloading the income statement from an online source. You can review how to do this in Chapter 4. 
 2. Pull out the revenue line item for several years.

Chunk 575 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
In most cases, one of the very first lines in the income statement is total revenue. Pull out total revenue from the income statement and place it in a spreadsheet or write it down so you can do further analysis.
  Again using IBM as an example, Table 5-2 show you how to put IBM’s 
total revenue into a format you can further analyze.

Chunk 576 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
10 506455-ch05.indd   7810 506455-ch05.indd   78 9/24/09   10:28:34 PM9/24/09   10:28:34 PM79  Chapter 5: Analyzing a Company’s Profitability Using the Income Statement
 3. Calculate the year-to-year percentage change. 
  Now that you have each year’s total revenue in one place, you can

Chunk 577 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
calculate the company’s revenue growth from year to year. Calculating percentage changes is covered in more depth in Chapter 4. But the way I like to remember this is that you subtract the “old” number from the “new” number, then divide by the “old” number and multiply by 100. 
  Consider an example calculating IBM’s 2008 revenue growth:
  $103.6 (2008 revenue, the “new” number) – $98.8 (2007 revenue, the 
“old” number) / $98.8 (2007 revenue, the “old number”) = 0.049.

Chunk 578 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Then multiply 0.049 by 100 to convert the number into a percentage, 
which is 4.9%. This analysis show you IBM’s total revenue grew by 4.9% in 2008. 
  4. Repeat step 3 for each year so you can see a multiyear trend. 
  One year’s revenue change doesn’t really tell you much. The fact that

Chunk 579 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
IBM’s revenue grew 4.9% is of limited value unless you compare it with something else. You may compare IBM’s growth to its competitors’ growth, as you will read more about in Chapter 16. But for now, you will want to see how 2008 revenue growth compares with growth in past years. I’ll save you the trouble by calculating the percentage changes and presenting them in Table 5-3.

Chunk 580 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Now that you have each year’s revenue growth, you can see just how rocky revenue can be, even at a large company like IBM. You’ll notice rev-enue grew by as much as 9.7% in 2003, and shrunk by up to 5.4% in 2005. Understanding just how uneven revenue growth can be from year to year, is critical to the work of fundamental analysis because you can see if a firm is cyclical. A cyclical company is one that experiences large swings in revenue based on the health of the overall economy. As an

Chunk 581 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
based on the health of the overall economy. As an investor, you might not be willing to pay as much for shares of a cyclical company if the economy is about to enter into a period of slower growth.

Chunk 582 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Resist the temptation to take simple averages of revenue growth and 
assume that average growth will continue forever. For instance, if you aver-
aged IBM’s growth between 2001 and 2008 by adding up the growth num-bers and dividing by the total number of years, you’d find the company 
grew, on average, by 2.6% a year. But fundamental analysts dig deeper and study year-to-year changes, to see how revenue ebbs and flows. 
  Don’t forget to also calculate the percentage changes of growth in the

Chunk 583 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
different business units. Taking the time to see how rapidly different parts of the business are growing can give you a peek into the com-pany’s direction. At IBM in 2008, for instance, the software unit grew the most rapidly by rising 10.5% over 2007, while the systems and technol-ogy unit shrunk by 9.5%. As a fundamental analyst, you might look into IBM’s software unit further for more explanation.

from customers. A good portion of the revenue goes out to pay direct costs, such as raw materials, and indirect costs like overhead and advertising. All these costs are recorded in the income statement so investors may see how much a company spent to generate revenue.

tal analysis is the ability to tear apart the numbers and see what comprises them. Analyzing a company’s costs is a great example. While some investors just look at total expenses, or maybe consider cost of goods sold and operating expenses, there’s much intelligence to be had by digging deeper. 
To show you what I mean, let’s crack open the financial can on Campbell

As companies find themselves competing glob-ally, fundamental analysts need to understand how important sales outside the U.S. are to a company. Analyzing revenue will give you great detail on a company’s global footprint. Most companies will break out what percent-age of their revenue came from different parts of the world, if not in the income statement, in the notes of an earnings press release issued to shareholders or in the regulatory filings.

Again, don’t let the table of numbers overwhelm you. Fundamental analysts 
rely on two simple but powerful techniques to convert a pile of numbers into meaningful data. With just a little math, you’ll be able to analyze the data and paint a picture that tells you a great deal about Campbell Soup.

First, common-size the costs and expenses. Again, just looking at Campbell

Chunk 594 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Soup’s costs and expenses don’t tell you much at first. You want to put them into perspective by comparing them with something. One of the best tricks used in fundamental analysis is common-sizing. Common-sizing is simply taking lines on financial statements and quantifying their size by comparing them to a total. When common-sizing is applied to the income statement, you compare each expense to revenue. That way, you can easily see whether the company’s expenses are growing at an alarming pace

Chunk 595 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
expenses are growing at an alarming pace compared with the growth of the business.

Chunk 596 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Best of all, common-sizing is simple. All you need to do is divide each cost

Chunk 597 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
and expense by total revenue and multiply by 100 to convert the number into a percentage. Start with Campbell Soup’s cost of goods sold in 2008. Divide the cost of goods sold of $4,827 by the company’s total revenue of $7,998 and multiply by 100. You should get 60.4%. In other words, the cost of making soup and other products cost 60.4 cents of every dollar of revenue. Next, follow the same directions for all the costs on Campbell Soup’s income state-ment. Table 5-5 shows you what you’ll find

at pace with the business. The one very slight exception is the cost of goods 
sold. In 2007, the company spent 59.4% of revenue on costs to produce prod-ucts. That went up very slightly in 2008. It’s a minor change, but points to an issue that’s worth digging further into. Perhaps the company’s raw materials costs rose slightly, or more customers are buying goods that cost slightly more to make. 
 When you common-size an income statement, it’s often best to use several

Chunk 602 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
years of data so you can see the trends from year to year. If a company’s research and development budget is soaring, for instance, you’ll spot the trend. Often an unusual blip on the common-sizing will clue you into some-thing worth looking further into. 
Next, measure the growth of costs and expenses. It’s also important to keep

Chunk 603 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
tabs on how rapidly costs and expenses are growing from year to year. Measure the growth of costs and expenses in the same way as measuring the growth in revenue above. 
What is the company’s bottom line? 
After paying all the bills, including all the direct costs, operating expenses and taxes, what’s left is the company’s net profit. 
The basic formula is as follows: 
Revenue – cost of goods sold – operating expenses + other income – 
other expenses – interest expense – taxes = Net Income

Chunk 604 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Net income is the end-all be-all for many investors. It’s the number that is used to see how a company did compared with the past and versus expec-tations investors had. You will want to see how rapidly net income grew or shrunk compared with previous years. 
 If you notice that a company’s net income is growing more slowly than 
revenue, that’s a quick tip-off that its expenses might be running amuck.

Chunk 606 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Finding Out What They Mean
If you hear that a company made $400 million last year, you recognize that 
sounds like quite a bit of money. But, fundamental analysis requires taking things a step farther. Fundamental analysis gives you the tools to put net income into perspective and understand what it means for you as an investor. 
Differences between the 
types of profit margins
One of the best ways to size up a company’s profit is by studying profit margins.

Chunk 607 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
At its most basic level, a profit margin is how much a company has left after paying for its expenses. However, there are several ways to measure profit mar-gins, all of which are instructive in fundamental analysis. There are three main types of profit margins fundamental analysts should be aware of, including: 
Gross profit margin

Chunk 608 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Gross profit margin
A company’s gross profit is one of the simplest ways to look at profitability. Gross profit is what’s left of revenue after subtracting direct costs, also known as cost of goods sold. Gross margin measures how much the company makes after paying costs directly connected with producing the product. 
The gross profit margin takes things a bit further by comparing gross profit

Chunk 609 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
with a company’s revenue. In other words, the gross profit margin tells you how much of revenue is kept, after paying direct costs, relative to sales. 
Here’s an example: Caterpillar. The maker of earthmoving and construction

Chunk 610 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
equipment reported revenue of $51.3 billion in 2008, and its cost of goods sold reached $39.6 billion. By subtracting $39.6 billion from $51.3 billion, you find Caterpillar’s gross profit was $11.70 billion. That’s great, but doesn’t tell you much. Here’s where fundamental analysis comes in. Divide the compa-ny’s $11.70 billion gross profit by its total revenue of $51.3 billion and multiply by 100. This quick division tells you Caterpillar had a gross margin of 22.8%.

Chunk 611 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
What’s that mean in plain English? After paying for direct costs, such as steel 
and laborers’ time on the assembly line, Caterpillar kept nearly 23 cents of every dollar in revenue. Just to give you an idea what gross margins typically are, among the 500 companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, the average 
10 506455-ch05.indd   8410 506455-ch05.indd   84 9/24/09   10:28:35 PM9/24/09   10:28:35 PM85  Chapter 5: Analyzing a Company’s Profitability Using the Income Statement

Chunk 612 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
gross margin is about 45.1, says Thomson Reuters. The fact Caterpillar’s 
gross margin is lower shows just how much of the firm’s costs are concen-trated in raw materials and other direct costs. 
 Gross profit margin is not as useful when studying software and Internet com-

Chunk 613 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
panies. A vast majority of the cost of producing software is overhead, and not direct costs. That’s one reason why Microsoft has very large gross profit mar-gins. For instance, Microsoft kept 81 cents of every dollar of sales after paying direct costs during its fiscal 2008 year, which ended June 30, 2008. But its operating margin, which reflects a more accurate picture of the cost to create software, is much lower, as we’ll discuss next.
Operating profit margin

Chunk 614 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Operating profit margin
A company’s operating profit is one step more sophisticated than the gross margin. Operating profit not only factors in a company’s direct costs, but indirect costs, too. Operating profit is what’s left of revenue after subtracting overhead costs.
Taking things a step further is the operating profit margin. The operating

Chunk 615 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
profit margin is calculated by dividing operating profit by revenue. It tells you how much the company keeps of revenue after paying direct costs and overhead. Operating profit margins are critical indicators for fundamental analysis, since they give a good idea of how profitable a firm is with respect to its core business. 
Going back to Microsoft shows clearly why for some businesses, the operat-

Chunk 616 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

Here you can see why Microsoft is considered to be such a profitable com-

pany, with its enviable 36.9% operating profit margin. This operating profit margin is about double the average 18% operating profit margin of companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500, says Thomson Reuters. 
 Some fundamental analysts take issue with operating profit, because it

Chunk 618 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
includes some expenses that are not actual costs. For instance, operating profit subtracts depreciation from revenue, even though depreciation isn’t an actual bill the company must pay. For this reason, some fundamental analysts recommend ignoring some of these intangible expenses when understanding how much a company is worth, as will be discussed further in Chapter 11.

Net profit margin
A company’s net profit or net income is the most comprehensive measure of profitability. Net profit tells you how many dollars the company kept after paying all its costs and expenses. The net profit margin, which is net profit divided by total revenue, tells you how much of every dollar in sales the com-pany keeps after paying all costs and expenses.

Chunk 621 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Companies can lose money, too. When that happens, it’s called a net loss. 
At its simplest level, net profit is operating profit minus everything else. 
Finding out about earnings per share
You might be wondering by now, “Okay great, the company made millions of 
dollars. Wonderful. So, what’s in it for me?”
That’s exactly what earnings per share is all about. Usually, one of the last

Chunk 622 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
items listed on a company’s income statement is earnings per share, most commonly known as EPS. If net income tells you how large a pie is, EPS tells you, the fundamental analyst, how big your slice is. 
EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the number of shares outstanding at 
the company. A company’s number of shares outstanding is the total number 
of shares that are owned by members of the public as well as restricted shares

Chunk 623 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
held by officers and directors of the company. Restricted stock shares are given to individuals with close connections to the company, such as the executive team of a company that was acquired. Restricted stock comes with

Chunk 624 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
of time. The number of shares a company has outstanding is available on the balance sheet, to be discussed more fully in Chapter 6. 
Everything you really need to know, though, is right on the income statement, 
including: 
 ✓ Basic earnings per share: This measure tells you how much of a slice of the company’s net profit you’re entitled to as a shareholder. The formula in its simplest form is:
  Net income / number of shares outstanding

Chunk 625 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Net income / number of shares outstanding
  Some companies have special classes of stock, called preferred stock. 
These dividends, if paid, should be subtracted from net income in the formula above when calculating basic earnings per share.

Chunk 626 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Diluted earnings per share: When you read in the newspaper about how much a company earned, you’re most likely reading about diluted earnings per share. Diluted EPS measures how much the company earned based on each share of stock. If you think of net income as a pizza, diluted EPS tells you how big of a slice you’re entitled to. Diluted EPS is commonly used because it’s the most conservative. It divides net income by the total number of shares that could possibly be outstand-ing, including

Chunk 627 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
that could possibly be outstand-ing, including the impact of employees converting their stock options into real shares.

Never underestimate the danger of employee stock options on the value of

Chunk 629 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
your claim to a company’s earnings. When employees are given options, and those options become valuable either because the employee works at the company for a set period of time or the stock rises, those shares can be con-verted into real shares. The avalanche of shares can water down, or dilute, how much of a claim you have on the company’s earnings. This is called dilu-tion, and is a big reason why you need to carefully compare basic EPS with diluted EPS. If diluted EPS is dramatically less

Chunk 630 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

Profit to Expectations
Ever notice how a company’s stock price falls, even after the company posts 
a huge increase in earnings? You can learn more about how to use informa-tion from the income statement to determine stock prices in Chapter 10. But it’s critical to realize that profits and earnings don’t always move in lockstep with stock prices.

It’s true that over time, a company with rising revenue and earnings will likely

Chunk 633 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
see its stock price rise, too. And as discussed in Chapter 3, correctly forecast-ing how to determine how much a company will earn and how much it will be worth in the future can be great for long-term success. Fundamental analysts can help you determine whether a stock is cheap or expensive relative to the company’s revenue and earnings. 
But in the short term, stock prices and earnings can seemingly have nothing

Chunk 634 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
to do with each other. And that’s where the skill, and a bit of luck, comes in when you try to match fundamental analysis with stock prices. The fact is that in the short term, stocks rise and fall largely based on how a company’s earnings compare with what’s expected. 
The importance of investors’ expectations

Chunk 635 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The importance of investors’ expectations
Remember, when you’re studying a company’s income statement, you’re not alone. There are hundreds, if not thousands of other investors looking at the same numbers and trying to place a price on the stock. They then buy and sell based on their fundamental analysis, to establish the current price. 
If the company’s revenue and earnings match what most people were expect-

Chunk 636 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
ing, that means the current stock price was likely correctly set. Only if the other investors were way off will the stock move much higher or lower after a company releases its income statement. You will discover more on this topic later in the book. But the role of expectations for earnings is important to dis-cuss now since it shows that just because you master the income statement doesn’t mean you’ll necessarily be a successful investor.

Even before a company puts out its income statement, analysts and other 
investors have had a chance to guess what they think the company will earn. These earnings estimates are usually based on diluted earnings per share.

It can be tricky to get an apples-to-apples comparison between the analysts’

Chunk 640 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

While analysts will usually forecast operating earnings, companies may sometimes include unusual and nonrecurring items that make comparison with the estimate problematic. For that reason, many companies attempt to help investors by offering pro forma earnings. Pro forma earnings don’t follow GAAP. Instead, adjustments are made by the company to make the reported EPS match the estimate.

Familiarizing Yourself with 
the Balance Sheet
If you’ve ever calculated your personal net worth, you already have a pretty 
good understanding of what a company’s balance sheet is. When you tally up your net worth, you generally perform a quick calculation that might look something like this: 
Value of things you own – value of things you owe = net worth

Chunk 649 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Consider this simple personal finance situation: You bought a $200,000 house, put 20% down ($40,000) and borrowed the rest ($160,000). Meanwhile, you have $20,000 in your savings account. You would calculate your net worth like this: 
$200,000 (home value) + $20,000 (savings) – $160,000 (loan amount) = $60,000 net worth
Keep this example in mind as you learn about how a company measures its assets, liabilities, and equity, as explained next.

Separating your assets 
from your liabilities
Just as biologists classify living creatures by placing them in a genus and 
species, accountants attempt to put everything companies own and owe into three buckets. Those buckets are:

Chunk 651 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Assets: Things a company owns. These might include tangible assets, such as physical manufacturing plants or raw materials sitting in a ware-house. Assets, too, might be intangible. Intangible assets are things like patents and trademarks, which have value even though you can’t touch them. 
 ✓ Liabilities: Things a company owes. Usually, liabilities include debt the company is on the hook for.

Chunk 652 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Shareholders’ equity (or just equity): What’s left of a company’s assets after accounting for its liabilities. Technically, equity represents all the money put into the company by investors and the portion of the profits the company has held onto. When companies hold onto earnings, rather than returning them to shareholders (often in the form a dividend), they are called retained earnings. It’s the equivalent to your own net worth.

Chunk 653 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
11 506455-ch06.indd   9211 506455-ch06.indd   92 9/24/09   10:29:18 PM9/24/09   10:29:18 PM93  Chapter 6: Measuring A Company’s Staying Power with the Balance Sheet
The most basic equation of business
Once accountants place a company’s assets and liabilities into the proper

Chunk 654 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
buckets, it’s possible to apply some basic math. And the calculation you use to measure your net worth is practically identical to how companies measure their shareholders’ equity. The formula companies use is just rearranged a bit and the terms are different. 
 Companies don’t necessarily refer to net worth. Net worth is more of a term 
used in personal finance. Instead, the difference between what companies own and what they owe is called shareholders’ equity.

Chunk 655 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
So, here’s the most basic formula used in business and the fundamental 
building block behind the balance sheet: 
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
As you can see, this formula states a company’s assets must equal the sum of what it owes and what the shareholders own (shareholders’ equity). At all times, a company’s assets must equal the sum of its liabilities and equity. The fact that both sides of this equation must be equal, or balance, is where the balance sheet gets its name. Clever, I know.

Chunk 656 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Some investors have an easier time understanding the fundamental formula 
used on the balance sheet by picturing it visually. For you right-brained read-ers out there, below in Table 6-1 is a diagram that’s often scribbled on the blackboard in Accounting 101 classes. 
Understanding the Parts 
of the Balance Sheet
Now that you understand the basic structure of the balance sheet, it’s time

Chunk 657 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
to start picking it apart. To do this, first know assets, liabilities, and equity can each be broken down further into smaller, more telling components. Deconstructing a company’s assets, liabilities and equity can be extremely useful in understanding how a company funds itself and keeps paying the bills by managing its ready-and-available cash, called working capital. 
 When you dissect a balance sheet, you begin to gain deeper knowledge about

Chunk 658 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
all the moving parts that make up a company. The balance sheet tells you what a company owns, what it’s borrowing, and where it gets the money to keep itself in operation.

Covering your bases with assets 
The best place to start exploring a company’s balance sheet is its list of

Chunk 659 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
assets. The portion of the balance sheet that records a company’s assets typically has the following parts:
 ✓ Current assets: A company’s current assets are things it owns that could theoretically be sold for cash within a year. These assets, also called short-term assets, are those the company can tap reasonable quickly to meet immediate cash obligations. Current assets can be further broken down into:

Chunk 660 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
• Cash: This is the easiest asset to understand. Companies have sav-ings accounts, too, and keep cash handy to pay bills. 
 • Cash equivalents: Companies will sometimes invest cash that’s stockpiled in short-term and high-quality investments that can be quickly sold. These investments give companies liquidity, or access to cash, but allow them to earn a slightly higher return that just holding cash. 
  When many fundamental analysts refer to a company’s cash, they

Chunk 661 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
are usually including cash equivalents in addition to cold-hard cash.
 • Marketable securities: Sometimes companies have cash available that they don’t need immediately, but expect they might need within a year. They might invest this cash in high-quality debt that matures in a quarter or two. These investments are relatively safe, but not as readily accessible as actual cash or cash equivalents.

Chunk 662 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
• Accounts receivable: When companies sell a product, they often don’t collect the cash right away. If you buy a book, for instance, you might use your credit card and the merchant isn’t paid imme-diately. These short-term IOUs are called accounts receivable.

Chunk 663 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
• Inventories: Companies must spend money to accumulate the things they plan to sell. Nearly all manufacturing companies, for instance, must buy raw materials to make their products. The value of these assets show up in the inventories line. 
 • Prepaid expenses. If a company pays a bill ahead of time, it has a credit with the supplier or merchant. That credit is an asset, since it reduces what the company must spend in the future.

Chunk 664 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
11 506455-ch06.indd   9411 506455-ch06.indd   94 9/24/09   10:29:18 PM9/24/09   10:29:18 PM95  Chapter 6: Measuring A Company’s Staying Power with the Balance Sheet
 ✓ Long-term liabilities:
 • Property, plant and equipment. Assets that cannot be turned

Chunk 665 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
into cash in a year are called long-term assets. One of the biggest groups of long-term assets include a company’s property, plant and equipment, nicknamed PP&E. These assets include buildings and other machinery and computers a company might own. For an oil company, for instance, PP&E might be oil rigs used to pull crude out of the earth.

Chunk 666 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
• Goodwill. Goodwill is an asset you can’t feel or touch, making it intangible. Goodwill usually appears on a company’s balance sheet after it buys another company. Goodwill is the amount paid for another company, above that company’s actual value according to accounting rules. The extra amount paid is considered an asset on the acquiring company’s balance sheet.

Chunk 667 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
• Other intangibles. Goodwill isn’t the only asset a company might have that can’t be touched or seen. Patents, brands and trade-marks, for instance, have value even though they’re not physical items. 
 • Total assets. All of the assets are added up to create a grand total of everything the company owns. This is called total assets and will be a number that’s used frequently in analysis, especially with financial ratios discussed in Chapter 8.

Chunk 668 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Total assets is an important number on the balance sheet. It must, and will, 
match the total of the company’s liabilities and equity. 
Just to give you an idea of what to expect when perusing the asset section of 
a balance sheet, Figure 6-1 shows you the top section of Hershey Food’s 2007 balance sheet. 
Getting in touch with a 
company’s liabilities
Just like it seems there’s always a bill in your mailbox when you open it, the

Chunk 669 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
same goes for companies. During the normal course of business, companies have hungry suppliers and service providers who demand to be paid for their products or services. But bills are just one form of liabilities companies have. The liabilities section of a balance sheet breaks down everything com-panies owe into these parts:

Chunk 670 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Current liabilities: If a company has bills that are due within a year’s time, they’re considered to be current liabilities. Not paying these bills usually means trouble for a company. Current liabilities come in several flavors fundamental analysts need to be aware of:
11 506455-ch06.indd   9511 506455-ch06.indd   95 9/24/09   10:29:18 PM9/24/09   10:29:18 PM96 Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
 • Accounts payable: Companies don’t typically have to pay right

Chunk 671 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
away for things they buy. Suppliers will usually extend trade credit to companies, giving them at least 30 days or even longer to pay for certain supplies, raw materials or services. 
 •  Short-term debt: This is the amount of debt the company must pay back within a year.
 • Current portion of long-term debt: Typically companies arrange to borrow money for many years. A portion of that long-term debt, though, is generally due within a year and is called the current por-tion of long-term debt.

Chunk 672 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
• Other current liabilities. Here’s the catch-all bucket for liabilities that don’t quite fit anywhere else. 
 ✓ Long-term liabilities:
 • Long-term debt: The costs of starting and maintaining a business can be massive. As a result, some companies turn to lenders to borrow money from, and if they’re lucky, they can line up long-term debt that doesn’t have to be paid for more than a year or longer. 
  Keeping an eye on a company’s long-term debt load is critical.

Chunk 673 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
While only the current portion is due within a year, the year of debt may come due shortly. If the company is unable to pay the debt or refinance it by borrowing from someone else, the company may default. When a company defaults, the lenders may threaten to take control of the company.

Chunk 674 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
• Other long-term liabilities: This includes liabilities, due in more than a year, that don’t fit in any of the other categories. A company will break down liabilities that are in here in the footnotes to the financial statements. The footnotes, typically available in a compa-ny’s 10-Q or 10-K, provide a more detailed breakdown of liabilities.

Chunk 675 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
• Deferred income taxes: Companies must keep two sets of financial statements. There’s the version you see, which is presented in this book, and a version for tax purposes for the IRS. Sometimes the accounting for taxes can be quite different in the two sets of books. Deferred income taxes help reconcile the differences. If a company has deferred income taxes, that means it may owe taxes in the future.

Chunk 676 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The liabilities section of the balance sheet might often look like Figure 6-2, which is from Hershey’s 2007 10-K.

Taking stock in a company’s equity

Chunk 679 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Taking stock in a company’s equity
Shareholders’ equity represents the total claim investors have on a com-
pany’s assets, free-and-clear of debt. That includes money investors injected into a company, in addition to profits that the company has held back, or retained. The equity section of many companies’ balance sheets include the following sections:

Chunk 680 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Preferred stock: Companies may issue ownership stakes that are kind of a blend between debt and equity. Like debt, preferred stock pays a cash payment that’s arranged ahead of time. However, as with common stock dividends, companies may suspend these preferred stock payments at any time.

Chunk 681 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Common stock: When you’re looking to buy a stake of a company, typi-cally these are the shares you’re buying. When you look up a stock quote, most of the time you’re getting the price of a share of a compa-ny’s common stock.
 ✓ Retained earnings: It’s up to a company whether or not to return its profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. If the company keeps earnings, it records the sum here.

Chunk 682 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Treasury stock: Sometimes not all of a company’s shares are available to bought or sold. A company might buy back its stock when it thinks it’s cheap, and put it aside. A company might also authorize to issue stock, but not actually issue it. Either way, the pool of unused shares are called treasury stock. 
 ✓ Total shareholders equity: The shareholders equity line of the balance sheet measures the value of shareholders’ stake in the company.

Chunk 683 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
A summary of the equity section of Hershey’s balance sheet appears below in Table 6-2.

Analyzing the Balance Sheet
Now that you understand the pieces and parts that make up the balance 
sheet, it’s time to start applying fundamental analysis. Just as you dug more deeply into the income statement in Chapter 5, in this section you’ll develop tools to glean insight from the balance sheet. 
Sizing up the balance sheet

Chunk 685 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Sizing up the balance sheet 
with common sizing
If you noticed while looking at Hershey’s balance sheet above, just looking at 
the numbers in isolation isn’t particularly useful. It’s helpful to put the assets, liabilities, and equity into perspective by comparing them with something. That’s why common sizing, a fundamental analysis tool applied with the income statement in Chapter 5, can be equally helpful when analyzing the balance sheet.

Chunk 686 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
When common sizing a balance sheet, you are attempting to show how sig-
nificant a company’s different assets, liabilities and forms of equity are to the entire firm. You only need three formulas to common size the entire balance sheet: 
 ✓ Assets: Divide each type of asset by the company’s total assets. 
 ✓ Liabilities: Divide each type of liability by the company’s total liabilities and stockholder’s equity.

Chunk 687 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Equity: Divide each category of equity by the company’s total liabilities and stockholders’ equity.
 Multiply the results of the three items above by 100 to convert the figures into 
a percentage. 
Imagine if you wanted to see how much Hershey relies on borrowed money, 
versus money raised from stock investors, to fund itself. That’s a perfect reason to common size the liabilities portion of Hershey’s balance sheet.

Chunk 688 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
To do this, you start with Hershey’s accounts payable ($223,019) and divide it 
by total liabilities and stockholders’ equity ($4,247,113). The result is 5.3%, and I’ll explain what that means in a bit. First, you might want to finish common sizing the whole statement. Table 6-3 shows you the results of common sizing the key parts of the liabilities and equity portion of Hershey’s balance sheet.

Chunk 689 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
11 506455-ch06.indd   9911 506455-ch06.indd   99 9/24/09   10:29:19 PM9/24/09   10:29:19 PM100 Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis

Total shareholders’ equity  14%
 Common sizing a company’s liabilities gives you an instant view of where

Chunk 690 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Hershey gets the money to keep itself going, or its capital structure.  
Understanding a company’s capital structure is key to understanding how well 
it’s positioned to withstand an economic downturn or how profitable it will be during strong economic growth. 
Just by doing a few multiplication problems, you get a very unique funda-

Chunk 691 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
mental look into Hershey. You can see Hershey receives its financing from a balanced number of sources, but leans toward relying more on debt. Hershey gets 20% of its financing from short-term loans, more than 30% from long-term loans and 14% from equity. 
 When companies rely on borrowed money to pay for their operations, it’s

Chunk 692 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
called leverage. Leverage can greatly enhance a company’s returns for stock holders as long as the company can comfortably keep up with its interest payments. Interest on debt is largely fixed, much like a monthly payment on a 30-year fixed mortgage is static. Interest also has a tax benefit of being deduct-ible. The question, though, is whether or not a company has borrowed too much. You can find out if a company is overleveraged by analyzing working capital, later in this chapter, and

Chunk 693 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
working capital, later in this chapter, and financial ratios in Chapter 8.

Chunk 694 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Looking for trends using 
index-number analysis
While balance sheets take a snapshot of a company’s assets, liabilities and 
equity at a set time of the year, the parts inside are constantly changing. When interest rates are low, for instance, a company may decide to leverage itself by borrowing more. Similarly, when stock prices are lofty, a company may choose to raise equity by selling stock.

Chunk 695 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
11 506455-ch06.indd   10011 506455-ch06.indd   100 9/24/09   10:29:19 PM9/24/09   10:29:19 PM101  Chapter 6: Measuring A Company’s Staying Power with the Balance Sheet
 Because assets, liabilities and equity are evolving, it’s important in fundamen-
tal analysis to pay attention to trends and changes between quarters and years. 
The index-number trend method is a great way to help you spot changes in a

Chunk 696 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
company’s capital structure over time. You can do an index-number analysis by choosing a year to be your starting point and then compare all assets, liabilities and equity to that point. 
For instance, if you want to start your analysis of Coca-Cola since 2005, you 
would first download the balance-sheet items for 2007, 2006, and 2005. In Table 6-4 you can see what some of the key parts of Coke’s balance sheet were in those years. 
Table 6-4 Coca-Cola’s Balance Sheet Since 2005

Shareowners equity 21,744 16,920 16,355
Certainly, you could eyeball the numbers above to get a general idea of the

Chunk 698 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
trends in the company’s assets and liabilities. But the index-number analysis is easy and will make the changes pop out. To create an index-number table, divide each line in the balance sheet by the corresponding value for the base year and then multiply by 100. 
 For instance, to calculate the index-number value for Coke’s cash and cash

Chunk 699 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
equivalents in 2006, divide its cash and cash equivalents in 2006 ($2,590) by cash and cash  equivalents in 2005 ($4,767) and then multiply by 100. The result is 54.3. If you complete the analysis of Coke’s balance sheet, you get something that looks like Table 6-5.
The index-number value of the base year, 2005 in Table 6-5, will be 100. 100 is 
the baseline of our analysis.

After completing the index-number analysis of Coke, you can quickly see

Chunk 701 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
what’s going on with the company’s capital structure. The first thing that jumps out is the fact Coke started increasing its level of debt in 2006 and really ramped it up in 2007. In its 10-K, Coke acknowledged a greater use of leverage, primarily to pay for acquisitions such as Vitamin Water maker Glaceau and energy drink Fuze. As a fundamental analyst, you note this. After all, the company has been trying to broaden its lineup of beverages beyond Coke. That diversification, though, is coming

Chunk 702 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Coke. That diversification, though, is coming with the expense of greater financial risk as the company must pay higher interest expense.

Chunk 703 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Appreciating working capital
When it comes to fundamental analysis, a key consideration is how prepared a company is to meet its short-term obligations. 
 A company may have a very bright long-term future ahead of it, but if it can’t 
meet payroll and pay its bills in the next month, it might not survive long enough to reach its potential. 
Just as you would certainly pay your heating bill before putting money in a

Chunk 704 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
401(k), companies, too, must make sure they have enough cash to satisfy short-term obligations. 
How do you determine whether a company can handle its short-term bills? 
Analyzing working capital is one of fundamental analysts’ favorite tools to access a company’s immediate financial situation. Working capital tells you whether a company can access cash needed to pay its most pressing bills over the coming year. It’s a measure of short-term liquidity.

Chunk 705 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Working capital will be discussed more in Chapter 8, along with the other 
financial ratios. But it’s important enough to start thinking about along with the balance sheet. The formula for working capital is: 
Working capital = Current assets – current liabilities 
11 506455-ch06.indd   10211 506455-ch06.indd   102 9/24/09   10:29:19 PM9/24/09   10:29:19 PM103  Chapter 6: Measuring A Company’s Staying Power with the Balance Sheet

Chunk 706 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
If a company has positive working capital and more current assets than cur-
rent liabilities, that gives a fundamental analyst a bit of comfort. However, if current assets are less than current liabilities — that means if a company’s business hits a snag — it may be forced to extreme measures to meet its bills, including selling off manufacturing plans or equipment in a fire sale. 
Analyzing here and now: The current ratio

Chunk 707 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Analyzing here and now: The current ratio
Closely related to working capital, and perhaps of even more value in fun-damental analysis, is a concept called the current ratio. The current ratio attempts to put a company’s current assets into perspective by comparing them with current liabilities. The formula is: 
Current ratio = Current assets / current liabilities

As a very general rule of thumb, fundamental analysts like to see at least a

The Danger of Dilution

The Danger of Dilution
Just as it’s possible for a company to borrow too much, it’s also possible for it to sell too much of itself to shareholders. Remember, shares of stock are like slices of a pizza. If you have a large pizza that’s cut into eight slices, everyone gets a decent amount of food. However, if you cut that same pizza into 16 slivers, then you’re likely to start hearing complaints. 
When companies issue too many shares, they are in effect slicing their profits

Chunk 711 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
into smaller and smaller slices. This process of bringing in more investors is known as dilution. And since dilution can seriously water down the value of your investment, it’s something worth being aware of as a fundamental analyst.

entitled to by owning a share of stock. Most companies disclose their number of shares outstanding on the balance sheet. The more shares outstanding, the smaller the slice of profits you’re entitled to. 
How stock can be watered down
Dilution occurs when a company’s number of shares outstanding increases. A company may increase its number of shares outstanding for a number of reasons, including to:

Chunk 713 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Acquire another company using its stock. When a company’s stock price is high, relative to competitors’, it may use its shares as a currency for acquisitions. A company may issue new shares and use them to buy another firm. Stock deals can be popular with companies, since they don’t consume precious cash, and investors like them because they may be tax-free events.

Chunk 714 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Pay stock options to employees. Hoping to make the workforce feel like and act like owners, some companies may issue shares to employees and executives. Stock options allow employees to buy shares of stock at discounted prices, as long as the company’s stock rises.

Chunk 715 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Reduce leverage. Companies that have borrowed too much in the past and have a life-threatening brush with bankruptcy, may try to clean up their balance sheet by issuing stock and paying down debt. Paying for peanut butter with jelly

Chunk 716 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Many mergers have bad endings. But in what may be one of the most logical mergers since peanut butter and jelly first came together to create PB&J, was the J.M. Smucker acquisition of Jif peanut butter from Procter & Gamble in June 2002. Since it paid for the roughly $800 mil-lion deal using stock, J.M. Smucker’s number of shares outstanding roughly doubled to nearly 50 million shares. Was the deal successful, even though it cut the company’s profits into twice as many slices? After the deal

and make their shares more valuable by buying back shares. In a buyback, companies use their cash to take shares off the market. Stock buybacks, in theory, make each share more valuable because a company’s profits are sliced into fewer pieces. Some companies may buy back stock even if they haven’t issued options, if they think the shares are cheap. 
 Stocks will often rally after a company announces a stock buyback. But funda-

Chunk 722 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
mental analysts know better than to fall for this trap. For one thing, companies might buy back stock with borrowed money, which increases their interest costs and risk. Many companies also say they will buy back stock and never actually do. Other firms end up issuing more new shares than they bought back, all but erasing any benefit of the buyback.

“Show me the money!” Those words screamed out by Cuba Gooding’s character, a fictitious Arizona Cardinals wide receiver in the 1996 
comedy “Jerry Maguire,” captured one football player’s desire for cold hard cash. And that same line could just as easily apply to fundamental analysis and the statement of cash flows. 
Accounting rules can become so convoluted it’s hard to just see how much

Chunk 725 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
cash a company is bringing in. You might read through a company’s income statement and balance sheet and feel as if you have a pretty decent under-standing of how the company is doing and what it owns. But revenue and profit are just numbers on a financial statement. It’s cash that really matters. It’s cash that pays the bills. 
The statement of cash flows, or cash-flow statement, is all about showing you

Chunk 726 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the money. The statement meticulously tracks the flow of cold hard cash in and out of a company. There’s nothing more reassuring than knowing a company is bringing in cash. 
Fundamental analysts relish in the brutal honesty of the cash-flow statement. 
And while the statement has its limitations, in this chapter you’ll find how tracking the cash flowing in and out of a company can take your analysis skills to the next level.

Looking at the Cash-Flow Statement 
As a Fundamental Analyst
To understand why a company’s cash flow can be more revealing about a

Chunk 728 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
company’s performance, consider this simple example. Imagine your daugh-ter has borrowed $10 from you to start a lemonade stand. The only stipula-tion for the loan is that she reports back to you on how the business is going. 
Excited about being an entrepreneur, your daughter quickly spends the $10 
you lent her to get up and running. She buys lemons, sugar, cups, and stirring spoons. It’s a hot summer day, so it looks like a winning business idea.

Chunk 729 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
At the end of the day, you ask your daughter how she did. Hardly able to 
contain her smile, she beams that business was great and she completely sold out of lemonade. She estimates she sold 50 cups of lemonade at 50 cents a cup. You do the math quickly and determine her profit was $15. Constructing an income statement in your head, as explored in Chapter 5, you calculate she

Chunk 730 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
brought in revenue of $25 (50 cups of lemonade at 50 cents) and spent $10 to make the product. That’s a net income of $15. 
But when you extend your hand to ask for your $10 back, thinking you’d let 
her keep the $5 profit, she reports that she doesn’t have any cash at all. It turns out that she accepted IOUs for all the lemonade she sold. Suddenly the business isn’t necessarily looking so good, since there’s no cash flow.

Chunk 731 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
This example is a gross simplification. But it gets to the point of why cash 
flow is critical to analysis. 
 Accounting rules, even if properly followed, may give the impression a 
company is doing better than it really is. Profit, as measured by rules made by accountants, are subject to dozens of estimates, approximations and hunches. But cash is cash. You either have it or you don’t. 
Getting into the flow with cash flow

Chunk 732 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Getting into the flow with cash flow
You might be wondering why you need to even bother with the statement of cash flows. After all, the income statement, explored in Chapter 5, tells you howprofitable the company is. And the balance sheet, discussed in Chapter 6, tells you how solid a company’s financial resources are. 
The statement of cash flows, though, deserves a spot in your fundamental 
analysis routine. The statement can provide valuable information when evaluating a company because it:

Chunk 733 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
12 506455-ch07.indd   10812 506455-ch07.indd   108 9/24/09   10:30:13 PM9/24/09   10:30:13 PM109  Chapter 7: Tracking Cash with the Statement of Cash Flow
 ✓ Cuts through the optics of accounting. As you learned in Chapter 5, 
measuring a company’s profit is a pretty convoluted process. There are even more machinations going on behind the scenes, as accountants classify expenses and revenue. In contrast, cash is cash. You either make cash profits or you don’t.

Chunk 734 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Links the different financial statements together. The income state-ment and balance sheet are somewhat independent of each other, since they’re measuring different aspects of a business. The statement of cash flows, though, draws upon information from both the income statement and balance sheet to give you one, complete view of the company.

Chunk 735 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Highlights cash generated from actually doing business. The statement of cash flows makes it very clear how much of the cash coming into a business is the result of the company actually selling its products and services. It’s a helpful way to look past some one-time gains a company might receive, say, by selling assets.
 Accounting standards were tightened in the early 2000s following the implo-

Chunk 736 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
sion of Enron. Even so, the income statement is to be regarded with some healthy skepticism. The statement of cash flows can let you intelligently look for potential red flags in a company’s accounting, which is one of the hall-marks of fundamental analysis. 
Consider the example of a company that offers customers, who agree to buy

Chunk 737 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
products or services now, a very lenient repayment schedule. Doing so would allow the company to book revenue now, boosting net income. The trouble, though, is that the company is essentially stealing net income from a future period. When companies do this, it’s referred to as channel stuffing, because the company is pushing product into the hands of customers prematurely to book sales now. The statement of cash flows, however, makes channel stuff-ing easy to spot, since the company didn’t

Chunk 739 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Breaking the cash-flow statement
into its key parts
The way the statement of cash flows is organized tells you a great deal about a 
company. The statement is divided into three main sections. Cash coming into or going out of a company is placed into one of three categories, including:

Chunk 740 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Cash flows from operating activities. Here, investors can get a good idea of how much cash a company brings in, or uses, during its normal course of business. It counts cash coming in from customers as well as cash used to pay suppliers for materials, to the government for taxes, and to pay workers’ salaries. 
12 506455-ch07.indd   10912 506455-ch07.indd   109 9/24/09   10:30:13 PM9/24/09   10:30:13 PM110 Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis

Chunk 741 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Cash flows from investing activities. Companies keep careful track of 
money they’ve spent upgrading, or investing in, themselves. This section, for instance, counts the cash consumed buying new assets such as equipment or facilities.

Chunk 742 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Cash flows from financing activities. While companies are generally hoping to become self-sufficient and support their operations with the cash they generate from their business, sometimes they need cash injections. This section of the balance sheet tallies up how much cash is plowed into a company by lenders and investors. And on the flip side, this section accounts for cash used to pay cash dividends to investors or to pay down debts.

Chunk 743 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Unfortunately, many companies aren’t as forthright with their statements of

Chunk 744 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
cash flows as they are with the balance sheet and income statement. When companies report their earnings using earnings press releases, a vast major-ity do not provide a statement of cash flows. You can read more about what’s contained in the earnings press release in Chapter 4. You may need to wait for weeks after a company reports its earnings before getting the statement of cash flows. Companies are required to include the statement in their 10-Q or 10-K filings.

Chunk 745 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
A few companies including Amazon.com, though, have started providing a 
statement of cash flows with their earnings press release. That’s a positive trend for fundamental analysts that other companies will hopefully follow.
Examining a company’s cash 
flow from operations
Typically, the first section of a company’s statement of cash flows deals with

Chunk 746 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
measuring how much cash a company brings in during its normal course of business. This key section, the first in the cash-flow statement, measures cash from operations, or formally called cash provided by / (used in) operating activities. The section tells you how much cash the company generated, or used, in the course of doing business. Table 7-2 shows you how much Kraft Foods generated in cash from its operations. 
 Reading the statement of cash flows can get complicated because there are

Chunk 747 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
many lines in the statement. Adding to the confusion is the fact some of the lines are positive and some are negative. Don’t stress. Just remember that the statement of cash flows is really just converting a company’s net income into a number that represents a company’s cash flow.  Secondly, just remember when a number in the cash-flow statement is positive, that means the activity brought cash into the company. Similarly, when the number is negative, the item consumed cash. If you’re more of a

Chunk 748 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the item consumed cash. If you’re more of a visual person, Table 7-1 shows you how to think of these adjustments.

Negative Uses cash
Positive Generates cash
A few of those adjustments made to net income to arrive at a company’s cash 
from operations are described in the following sections.
Depreciation and amortization

Chunk 750 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Depreciation and amortization 
Usually, the biggest adjustment to net income to convert it into cash from operations is depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is an expense companies are required to include on their income statement, that doesn’t actually cost a company cash. Depreciation tallies the expense of the wear and tear on its equipment. Amortization, on the other hand, is the erosion of value of intangible assets, like patents or trademarks.

Chunk 751 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Depreciation can be a somewhat difficult item for investors to understand. Think 
of it this way. Every year, the value of your car falls due to age, and wear and tear. It’s a real expense, since it is technically costing you money. But when your car depreciates, you don’t get a bill for it. You don’t have to write a check, and it doesn’t cost you cash immediately. As a result, depreciation is added back to net income when measuring a company’s cash flow from operations. 
Tax adjustments

Chunk 752 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Companies keep two sets of books. There’s one set for investors, which mea-sures earnings according to the accounting rules. Then there’s a set required by the Internal Revenue Service for taxes. The different sets of books have different rules. As a result, a company may pay taxes to the IRS before the tax expense is recorded in the books monitored by accountants. Confused yet? Don’t worry. Just know that when a company actually writes a check and pays taxes, which aren’t recorded on the

Chunk 753 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
and pays taxes, which aren’t recorded on the income statement, it must subtract the amount from net income. It’s subtracted since paying the taxes ate up some of the company’s cash.

Chunk 754 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Gains on divestitures 
When a company sells a unit, it may add the profit on the sale to its net income. But remember, that profit didn’t result from the company selling products or services. Since the sale didn’t generate sales from operations, the amount is subtracted from net income.
12 506455-ch07.indd   11112 506455-ch07.indd   111 9/24/09   10:30:13 PM9/24/09   10:30:13 PM112 Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
Asset impairments or losses on sales of discontinued operations

Chunk 755 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Believe it or not, companies sometimes make poor business decisions. They

Chunk 756 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
might try a new business concept, which flops spectacularly, or realize an asset they bought has lost its value. When companies are hit with these charges, accountants consider them to be costs and require the companies to take a hit to the income statement. However, savvy fundamental analysts know many of these flops don’t actually cost companies cash. And that’s why many of these charges are added back to net income to arrive at cash from operations. 
Accounts receivable

Chunk 757 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
If you’re worried about a company claiming it’s doing better than it really is, this section of the cash flow statement is critical. As you discovered in Chapter 6, a company’s accounts receivable is a tally of how much its customers owe for products they’ve bought. If you see accounts receivable soar, that means customers are mostly buying on credit instead of paying cash. The increase in accounts receivable eats into a company’s cash because the company is essentially giving customers a

Chunk 758 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the company is essentially giving customers a credit card.

Chunk 759 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
If you’re worried a company might be stuffing the channel, pay close attention 
to the change in accounts receivable. A big jump in accounts receivable com-pared to the increase of a companies’ revenue can be a tip-off. 
Accounts payable

Chunk 760 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Accounts payable
When you buy something using a credit card, you get the asset without using cash. It’s the same concept with companies, who may buy supplies or mate-rials on credit. They’re able to get their hands on the things they need to conduct business, without using cash. When a company’s accounts payable increases, it’s considered a boost to cash and added to net income. 
 If you notice accounts payable is rising relative to a company’s cost of goods

Chunk 761 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
sold (discussed in Chapter 6), watch out. It might mean the company isn’t paying its bills on time, which may inflate its cash.
Inventories
If you’ve ever read about just-in-time manufacturing, you understand why companies go to great lengths to keep inventories low. Buying piles of mate-rials needed for business consumes precious cash. So by keeping inventory

Chunk 762 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
levels down, companies can hang onto cash. You’ll see this immediately on the statement of cash flow. If inventories rise, the increase is subtracted from net income to measure a company’s cash from operations. Likewise, if a com-pany uses up inventory, it’s a boost to its cash levels. 
12 506455-ch07.indd   11212 506455-ch07.indd   112 9/24/09   10:30:13 PM9/24/09   10:30:13 PM113  Chapter 7: Tracking Cash with the Statement of Cash Flow
Net cash (used in) / provided by operating activities

Chunk 763 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Here’s the end-all-be-all when it comes to measuring a company’s cash flow 
from its operations. After making all the painstaking adjustments to net income, to add back items that didn’t use cash and subtract those that did, you get a company’s cash from operations or net cash (used in) / provided by operating activities (see Table 7-2).
 When net cash (used in) / provided by operating activities is positive, that

Chunk 764 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
means the company generated cash from its normal line of business. If the number is negative, that means the company burned cash. Some companies will put the negative number in parentheses while others make the number red in the financial statements.

Considering a company’s
cash from investments
When you buy a company’s stock, you want to make sure it’s making adequate 
investments in itself to keep things in working order. That’s where the section of the cash-flow statement, called the cash from investing or cash provided by / 
(used in) investing activities comes in.

Chunk 766 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
(used in) investing activities comes in.

This part of the cash-flow statement lets you see how much cash the com-
pany is using to keep its factories humming or stores looking presentable. Generally, investments companies make in themselves can consume large amounts of cash for things including:

Chunk 767 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Updating stores to remain relevant. A retailer, for instance, may need to periodically remodel stores to keep them interesting to shoppers. 
 ✓ Enhancing capacity. A manufacturer that’s running full tilt may need to add warehouse space to handle increased demand. 
 ✓ Upgrading equipment. A hospital may be able to improve patient sat-isfaction and reduce wait times by buying a state-of-the-art device that works faster or is more effective.

Chunk 768 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Acquisitions. Companies might decide it’s cheaper to buy a rival that’s already in an area of business, instead of trying to launch its own business. 
 ✓ Divestitures. When companies sell off a unit, they typically receive cash. That cash received isn’t from operations. It’s from investing; at least that’s what the accountants say. Even if a company technically lost money on a unit that’s sold off, if it gets at least some cash, that’s still considered a positive cash flow.

Chunk 769 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
For simplicity, companies will often lump all their investments in improving, 
enhancing or updating their facilities into a single item on the cash-flow state-ment called capital expenditures, or cap ex for short. If you’re interested in dig-ging more deeply into what capital expenditures a company made, the details will be provided in the footnotes in the 10-K. 
Below in Table 7-3 you can take a look at the investments Kraft Foods made

Getting into a company’s cash 
from financing activities
Companies are often like politicians: They seem to be constantly raising 
money. Instead of trying to line up financing for their campaigns, though, companies need funding to keep themselves going.

Chunk 772 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
A classic example would be a young retail company. The company may not 
have enough cash to buy all the shirts, pants, and shoes it needs to put into its store. The retailer, then, might borrow money to buy the merchandise, and plan to pay it back after the goods are sold. The money borrowed is con-sidered a positive cash flow from financing activities.
A company’s financing activities may bring in or use up cash in a variety of

Chunk 773 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
primary ways. Generally, cash is brought in by borrowing money or selling stock to investors. All this is summarized right in the cash from financing activities section of the statement of cash flows. Table 7-4 shows an example using Kraft. The biggest uses or generators of cash from financing activities include:

Chunk 774 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Increasing or decreasing the company’s debt load: As you discovered while reading about the balance sheet in Chapter 6, companies can finance themselves by using their profits, by borrowing or by selling stock to shareholders. Each of these forms has its advantages and disadvantages. 
  Here, in this section of the statement of cash flows, you can see whether

Chunk 775 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
or not a company is generating cash by borrowing or using cash by paying back debt. If a company decides it has borrowed too much, for instance, it may choose to use cash to pay down its debt.
  Kraft’s cash-flow statement, in Table 7-3, distinguishes between its short-
term debt and long-term debt. Short-term debt is most pressing, as it’s due within a year, while long-term debt matures in more than a year. Kraft in 2007 issued more than $12 billion in new long- and short-term debt.

Chunk 776 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Buying back the company’s stock: From time to time, companies might choose to buy their own stock. When they do this, they use cash to take shares out of the hands of the public by buying them. This reduces the number of slices a company’s profits are cut into, potentially making each share more valuable. 
 ✓ Paying out dividends to shareholders:  Some companies, usually those in

Chunk 777 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
mature businesses with stable cash flow, might generate more cash than they need to run themselves. These companies generally will return cash to shareholders by issuing dividends. These payments consume cash.

 ✓ Net cash provided by / (used in) financing activities:  After accounting

Chunk 778 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
for all the cash brought in by borrowing and issuing stock, and cash used 
by extinguishing debt, buying back stock and paying dividends, you get the final result. Net cash provided by / (used in) financing activities , or 
cash from financing activities, shows you whether the company was a net gainer or user of cash after considering all money-raising events.

How Investors May Be Fooled by 
Earnings, But Not Cash Flow
Investors often pay very close attention to a company’s revenue and prof-
its. Too much attention, probably. Every quarter, during so-called earnings

Chunk 780 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
season, investors look at what companies said they earned, compare those results with their expectations, and either buy or sell the stock. 
The fact investors pay such close attention to earnings is not missed by com-

Chunk 781 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
panies’ managements. There’s a huge incentive for companies to never miss earnings expectations, or how much investors think the company will make, since doing so can cause a stock price to fall precipitously. Adding to the incentive to not disappoint: Many executives’ pay packages are closely tied to the companies’ stock price. If earnings disappoint and the stock falls, there goes the Hawaiian vacation for the CEO.

Chunk 782 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
12 506455-ch07.indd   11612 506455-ch07.indd   116 9/24/09   10:30:13 PM9/24/09   10:30:13 PM117  Chapter 7: Tracking Cash with the Statement of Cash Flow
Meanwhile, due to the flexibility of accounting rules, there are ways for man-
agement to manage earnings. The term “manage earnings” describes a whole host of things management can do to even out net income and earnings each quarter, and reduce the chances of disappointing investors.

Chunk 783 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Management’s ability to manage earnings largely stems from the way the 
income statement is constructed. Generally, financial transactions use accrual 
accounting. Accrual accounting records revenue when sales are made, and costs when they’re incurred. That is very different from cash accounting, which records revenue when sales are collected and costs are paid.

Chunk 784 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
When a company’s profit is widely different from the cash it’s bringing in, that’s something of great importance to a fundamental analyst. I’ll show you how fundamental analysts watch for this potentially disturbing trend later in this chapter. 
 Companies can also inflate the cash. The most common way would be to

Chunk 785 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
avoid paying their bills. Eventually, though, this tactics will catch up with a company when its suppliers or other creditors threaten legal action or stop shipping supplies and raw materials.
A quick-and-dirty way to monitor 
a company’s cash flow
You can spend hours analyzing the statement of cash flows. And later in the 
book, I’ll share with you some financial ratios and other things you can do to analyze the cash coming into and out of a company.

Chunk 786 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But here, I want to share with you one of the fastest and most effective funda-
mental ways to analyze a statement of cash flows. It’s such a simple form of analysis, it’s not a bad idea to do with any company you invest in or have an interest in. 
If you recall, profits certainly are important. But cash flow is king. You could

Chunk 787 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
have a company making giant profits according to the income statement, but without bringing in much cash. Remember the lemonade stand discussed earlier in the chapter? The answer: Compare a company’s net income with its cash from operations. It’s very simple fundamental analysis to do. All you need is the company’s statement of cash flows. 
If a company is generating as much cash as it’s reporting in net income, that

Chunk 788 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
can be a good indication it has high-quality earnings. High-quality earnings are those that are backed up by cold hard cash, not just smoke and mirrors made possible from accounting rules. 
12 506455-ch07.indd   11712 506455-ch07.indd   117 9/24/09   10:30:14 PM9/24/09   10:30:14 PM118 Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
 If this analysis seems confusing, keep reading. Once you follow the steps

Chunk 789 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
below and practice a few times, you’ll be surprised at how easy it is to com-pare a company’s net income with its cash from operations.
Don’t assume the tightening of accounting standards in the early 2000s

Chunk 790 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
stomped out low-quality earnings. Certainly, many companies cleaned up their accounting in 2002 and 2003 in the wake of Enron. Even so, the number of firms with lower-quality earnings have been creeping up again. Table 7-5 shows the number of companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 that reported net income that was greater than their cash from operations. 
Table 7-5 Earnings Quality Rises and Falls

tions in 2007 and net income in 2007
Below I’ll show you how to perform this form of cash-based earnings-quality 
analysis on Kraft, with the following steps: 
 1. Look up the company’s net income. As you learned in Chapter 5, a

Chunk 792 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
company’s net income is available on the income statement. But you can also take it from the very top line of the statement of cash flows. For Kraft, net income was $2.6 billion in 2007. 
 2. Look up the company’s cash flow from operations. Cash flow from 
operations is how much the company generated from its business. It’s kind of like the cash version of net income. If you recall, Kraft’s cash flow from operations was $3.6 billion in 2007.

Chunk 793 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
3. Compare net income with cash flow from operations. You’ll want to 
see cash flow from operations be at least equal to, if not larger, than net income. That tells you that the company is generating as much cash as it purports to generate in earnings. Table 7-6 summarizes what you need to know. 
  For instance, at Kraft, the company brought in $1 billion in cash above 
its reported earnings in 2007, giving you decent confidence the company has high-quality earnings.

Chunk 794 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

Table 7-6 Sizing Up a Company’s Earnings Quality
If cash from operations is . . . It means the company . . .
Greater than net income Generates more cash than it reports to share-

Less than net income Generates less cash than it reports to share-holders as earnings. It has low-quality earnings

Just because a company’s net income is less than its cash flow from opera-

Chunk 796 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
tions doesn’t mean it’s committing fraud. It just means a substantial portion of the profit it’s reporting isn’t materializing in cash. This might happen, for instance, when a fast-growing company sells goods so rapidly it must book profits before it can collect cash from customers. Still, when you see cash flow from operations that’s less than net income, it’s a reason to be concerned and dig further to determine the cause. 
Understanding the Fundamentals 
of Free Cash Flow

Chunk 797 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
of Free Cash Flow 
Face it. Earnings may impress investors, but cash flow pays the bills. Even 
if a company posts remarkable revenue growth, if it can’t get money into the doors fast enough to pay its own bills, it’s toast. That’s where free cash flow comes in. Free cash flow tells you how much cash a company generates (or uses) during the normal course of doing business, including the cost of upgrading and maintaining its equipment and facilities.

Chunk 798 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
That’s a mouthful, I know. Just remember free cash flow is a relatively easy 
fundamental analysis tool that can tell you a great deal about a company’s generation or burning up of cash. Watching a company’s free cash flow is kind of like watching the fuel gauge when you’re driving. Just as you want to know when fuel is running low, you want to know when cash is drying up. 
 There are many ways to analyze cash flow. Some analysts attempt to determine

Chunk 799 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
how much cash a company is throwing off by studying earnings before interest,

Chunk 800 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. EBITDA adjusts a company’s net income by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. EBITDA can be another way to study how profitable a company is and offers a rough idea of how able a company is to pay its interest costs. But don’t make the mistake of assuming EBITDA is a company’s cash flow, even though many analysts do. EBITDA doesn’t factor in the cash eaten up by inventory, extending credit to customers or used to buy new

Chunk 801 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
extending credit to customers or used to buy new equipment. Trust me on this one. When you want to know how much cash a company is using up, rely on free cash flow as described in the section below.

Chunk 802 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

Calculating free cash flow
The term free cash flow might sound pretty complex and academic. But you 
might be surprised at how easy it is to calculate a company’s free cash flow. Everything you need to measure free cash flow is available on the statement of cash flows. 
In fact, if you’ve followed the calculation of a company’s cash from opera-

Chunk 803 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
tions in that part of the chapter above, you’re more than halfway to arriving at free cash flow. The formula for free cash flow looks like this: 
Free cash flow = Cash from operations – Capital expenditures

Chunk 804 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Again picking on Kraft as an example, you can calculate the company’s free cash flow by subtracting its capital expenditures of $1.241 billion from its cash from operations of $3.571 billion, to arrive at free cash flow of $2.3 billion. Kraft is generating cash. But that’s not always the case. In the next section of this chapter, I’ll show you how to analyze a company that’s burning through cash and find out how long it’ll take before it burns through its entire wad.

Chunk 805 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Some beginning fundamental analysts are uncertain why capital expenditures

Chunk 806 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
should be subtracted from cash flow from operations to arrive at free cash flow. The idea is a company cannot continue very long without reinvesting and upgrading its infrastructure. The example of a manufacturing company is especially helpful. After a certain period of time, machinery that’s left with no maintenance will break down or not work properly. Putting money into keep-ing up equipment is critical if a company is to remain in business.Enron’s lack of earnings quality

Chunk 807 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The implosion of Enron left many investors flabbergasted. But for fundamental analysts who know how to measure a company’s earn-ings quality, there were some huge red flags to warn them. When Enron’s stock price was still relatively lofty at $63 a share, the company’s financial statements showed shockingly low earnings quality. When the company published its earnings press release, it wowed inves-tors with a better-than-expected profit of $425million for the quarter. But fundamental analysts

Chunk 808 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
for the quarter. But fundamental analysts knew better. An examination of the company’s cash-flow statement showed Enron burned $464 million in cash during the same quarter it reported spectacular earnings. That was a huge warning signal, and a big reason how a funda-mental analyst would have known to avoid this disastrous stock that ended up losing nearly its entire value.

Chunk 809 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

Measuring a company’s cash-burn rate
One of the great reliefs of reality shows is that eventually, the contestants 
with no talent finally get the boot. Whether it’s the singer with the horrible voice in “American Idol” or the clumsy player in “Survivor,” eventually those that don’t belong are eliminated.

Chunk 810 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The same brutal and harsh reality applies in the business world. Companies 
that run out of cash are often history (unless they’re able to get a bail-out). And as a fundamental analyst, it’s important to understand how this Darwinism works. 
 When a company relies on borrowed money, the death toll occurs when a com-

Chunk 811 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
pany misses interest payments on its debt. At that point, lenders can take over the company and force it to restructure itself. But what if a company hasn’t borrowed? For these companies, the music stops when they run out of cash. 
And at this point, you have all the basic skills you need to measure when 
a company will run out of cash, or its cash burn. When you do a cash-burn analysis, you measure how long a company’s cash pile will last if it continues to consume cash at its current rate.

Chunk 812 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Some of the best examples of cash burn occurred during the dot-com boom. 
Several Internet companies raised gobs of money during the boom. But after the Internet bubble burst, many were unable to either sell stock or borrow. That meant they only had the cash they’d saved to survive on. 
Since many Internet companies were losing money and burning cash at such

Chunk 813 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
a rapid pace, they stood to run out of cash before they could ever make a dime for investors. In April 2000, USA TODAY found that three of the 14 largest online retailers would burn through their cash piles in less than 12 months. All three ended up either filing for bankruptcy protection or being acquired by rivals for pennies a share, all but wiping out investors.
Fundamental analysis can help you steer clear of these situations. Here’s the 
formula you need:

Chunk 814 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
formula you need: 
Year’s supply of cash = Cash and cash equivalents / free cash flow 
 If the company burned cash, it will have a negative free cash flow. Convert it 
into a positive number before using the formula above. 
An example is Value America, an online retailer that was a darling on Wall 
Street during the Internet boom. During 1999, the company burned $109.9 million in cash from operations. Value America spent an additional $16.3

Chunk 815 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
12 506455-ch07.indd   12112 506455-ch07.indd   121 9/24/09   10:30:14 PM9/24/09   10:30:14 PM122 Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
million for capital expenditures. Adding the two numbers together, Value 
America’s free cash flow was a negative $126.2 million. Meanwhile, the com-pany ended 1999 with cash and cash equivalents of $52.1 million. 
So, using the formula: 
52.1 / 126.2 = 0.4
Think of yourself as a doctor telling a patient how many months they have to

Chunk 816 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
live. To convert the 0.4 into a time frame, multiply 0.4 by 12 to see how many months the cash will last. The result? Value America had just enough cash to survive just shy of five months. And guess what? The company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2000. Fundamental analysts pay close attention to companies’ cash-burn rates for this reason, since it’s critical for companies to generate enough cash to become sustainable.

The financial statements, by design, give off an aura of orderliness. All the

way, extracting the information you need for fundamental analysis gets a little messy. Reading the financial statements from top to bottom only tells you so much. To really take your fundamental analysis to the next level, you’ll need to learn how to put items on financial statements into perspective. And that means taking a number from one financial statement and comparing it with another. Financial ratios are one of the best ways to do this. Ratios compare one financial measure with another

Really Going on at a Company
You might not realize it, but you’re probably already using ratios in your daily

Chunk 823 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
life. For instance, the fact you put 12 gallons of gasoline in your car doesn’t tell you anything about the vehicle’s efficiency. But if you look at how many miles you drove on those 12 gallons and examine miles per gallon, you can find out if your car is a gas-guzzler or not. Similarly, when remodeling your home, you may figure out which carpet or tile is the best buy by comparing the price per square foot, which is also a ratio.

Chunk 824 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Financial ratios work the exact same way as these everyday ratios. By com-
paring a piece of data from one financial statement to another piece of data, often from another financial statement, you get fundamental insight into the company that neither number alone would provide. Financial ratios are help-ful in fundamental analysis because they allow you to:

Chunk 825 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Compare several companies’ financials against each other. Financial ratios give you a relatively common basis in which to rank companies, usually in the same industry, against each other. 
 ✓ Draw conclusions from all the financial statements. By pulling num-bers from the income statement and balance sheet, you can glean insights you’d never get by reading just one of the statements.

Chunk 826 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Get quick insights. With just a few division problems, you can get a pretty good idea at how skilled a management team is and how well the business is operated. 
 Some ratios allow you to compare two numbers you might not think would

Chunk 827 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
have anything to do with each other. One of my favorite examples is one ratio that measures employee productivity. Just divide a company’s total revenue by its number of employees and you find out, on average, how much business each employee brings in. The higher the number, the more productive each worker is. You can then compare the company’s productivity to rivals in the same industry, as shown in Table 8-1.
ExxonMobil, for instance, reported total revenue of $477.4 billion in 2008. The

Chunk 828 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
oil company started 2008 with 107,100 employees. When you divide revenue by the number of employees, you find out that every employee, on average, generated $4.5 million in revenue. If you work at ExxonMobil, maybe it’s time to ask for a raise? 
 When analyzing financial ratios, it’s most useful to compare a company with 
its competitors.  For instance, ExxonMobil and energy companies generate high revenue per employee since their businesses are so capital intensive.

Chunk 829 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Capital-intensive businesses rely on machinery to generate a large portion of their revenue, which makes the employees look like productivity superheroes.

Which financial ratios you should 
know and how to use them
Financial ratios are kind of like vegetables. There are countless veggies,

Chunk 831 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
including some you may not have even heard of. And just to push this anal-ogy even further, while some people love broccoli, others can’t even stand the sight of the stuff. The same goes with financial ratios. You could create an entire book just dedicated to financial ratios. Some fundamental analysts love some, like return on equity, while others find them to be misleading. I’ll give you my opinion on the ratios, but it’s up to you as a fundamental analyst to decide which ones are the best.

Chunk 832 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
There are hundreds of financial ratios because they’re just division problems, 
and there’s nothing to stop you from comparing just about anything on the financial statements with something else. The question, though, is whether or not the ratio is valuable. 
That’s why in this section, I’m going to step you through the greatest hits 
of financial ratios. These are the ratios you’re most likely to encounter, and those that are believed to have some value.

Generally, financial ratios fall into one of five categories, including: 
 ✓ Profitability: These ratios allow you to put the profit, or loss, generated 
by a company into perspective. These ratios are typically called profit 
margins. But there are several kinds of profit margins, including gross, 
operating and net. These ratios are covered in detail in Chapter 5, so I won’t go through them again here.

 ✓ Management effectiveness: Ever wonder if a CEO is doing a good or 
bad job? Many investors just look at the stock price to make that judg-ment. But that’s somewhat unfair since the CEO can’t control the minds of investors. However, ratios like return on assets, return on equity and return on invested capital are affected by CEOs’ decisions.

Chunk 835 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Efficiency: When you invest or lend money to a company, you want to know your cash is being put to good use. And that’s the goal of the efficiency ratios, to indicate how wisely the company is managing its resources.

Chunk 836 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Financial condition: When you invest in a company, you want to know it has the resources it needs to endure. The current ratio, discussed in Chapter 6, introduced you to the idea of using ratios to check a com-pany’s staying power. But there are more such tools at the fundamental analysts’ disposal.

Chunk 837 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Valuation: A stock’s per-share price, while the fixation of most investors, doesn’t tell you much about how expensive the stock is. It’s the stock’s valuation, or how much you’re paying for a company’s earnings, that matters.

Using ratios to grade management
There’s something refreshing about the way the performance of athletes is measured. Runs, goals and baskets are all meticulously counted as part of keeping score. But in sports, individual’s performances are tracked even more closely, as everything from errors to misses and fumbles get tallied up. At the end of a game, there’s no doubt over how a player did.

Return on equity
For many investors, the key ratio to pay attention to is return on equity, or 
ROE. This measure tells you how much profit the company is generating from money entrusted to it from investors. The formula is: 
Return on equity = Net income / average shareholders’ equity

Chunk 843 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

To measure Cisco Systems’ return on equity, you first need to calculate average 
shareholders’ equity. That’s shareholder equity from one year plus the previ-ous year, divided by two. For Cisco, that’s $34,353 plus $31,480, divided by 2. 
Next, you divide the company’s net income ($8,052) by the average share-

Chunk 844 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
holders’ equity ($32,917). The answer for Cisco is a very strong 24.5%. If you do the same analysis for other companies in the tech sector, you’d find an average ROE of about 20%. And to put this into perspective, companies in the S&P 500 generated an average ROE of 21% in the mid-2000s. 
 Don’t assume that just because a company has a higher ROE than another,

Chunk 845 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
it’s a better company. A company’s ROE may be depressed because it has a large investment in assets. Those assets might give the company an edge over rivals in the long run. That’s why it’s best to compare one company’s ROE to another’s, in the same industry.

Return on invested capital

Chunk 846 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Return on invested capital
For savvy fundamental analysts, return on invested capital, or ROIC, is the 
ultimate gauge of a company’s profitability. It tells you how much money the company makes on all the money, including both debt and equity, that’s been entrusted to it. 
Calculating ROIC is very worthwhile, even though it takes a little math. To 
keep it simple, I’ve broken down the calculation into steps below. 
There are many variations on how to calculate ROIC; some are overly sim-

Chunk 847 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
plistic and others are mind-numbingly complex. You’re essentially dividing a company’s cash income by its total debt and equity. Below, I give you the steps that will work for most fundamental analysis:
 1. Calculate the company’s earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT.

Chunk 848 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
This is a rough measure of the company’s cash profit, excluding the cost of paying interest expense and taxes. It’s a very rough estimate of how much profit the company has available to pay interest with. The formula looks like this: 
  (Revenue - cost of goods sold - SG&A - R&D - depreciation and 
amortization) 
  For Cisco, that’s: 
  ($39,540 – $14,056 – $10,387 – $5,153 – $499) = $9,445
 2. Adjust EBIT for taxes. Multiply the answer from step 1 by (1 – tax rate).

Chunk 849 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
This adjusts EBIT for taxes.
  For Cisco, that’s:
  $9,445 * (1–0.375) = $5,903. That’s Cisco’s tax-adjusted EBIT.
 3. Calculate the total capital possessed by the company for the most 
recent year. This measure tells you how much money, including debt and equity from shareholders, the company has at its disposal. If you need a refresher on the difference between debt and equity, review Chapter 6.
  (Total common equity + current portion of long-term debt + long-
term debt)

Chunk 850 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
term debt) 
  For Cisco, that’s: 
  ($34,353 + $500 + $6,393) = $41,246 for 2008
 4. Calculate the total capital for the previous year. For Cisco, that’s: 
  ($31,480 + 0 + $6,408) = $37,888 for 2007
13 506455-ch08.indd   12813 506455-ch08.indd   128 9/24/09   10:30:58 PM9/24/09   10:30:58 PM129  Chapter 8: Using Financial Ratios to Pinpoint Investments
 5. Take the average total capital. Add the two years together and divide 
by 2. 
  For Cisco, that’s: 
  $39,567 = ($41,246 + $37,888)/2

Chunk 851 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
$39,567 = ($41,246 + $37,888)/2
 6. Calculate ROIC. Divide the answer from step 2 by the answer from step 5. 
  For Cisco, that’s: 
  $5,903/$39,567 = 0.149
 7. Convert ROIC into a percentage. Multiply the answer from step 6 by 
100. For Cisco, that’s 0.149 * 100, or 14.9%.
For an ROIC, 14.9% is very strong. That means the company is generating a

Chunk 852 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
nearly 15% return on all the cash that’s entrusted to it. The average ROIC of S&P 500 companies was about 13 in the mid-2000s. But again, it’s best to com-pare a company’s ROIC with other firms in the industry, and since the indus-try average is 15, Cisco is right in line. 
 When ROIC is lower than return on shareholders’ equity, that tells you part of

Chunk 853 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the company’s returns are the result of the use of borrowed money, or leverage. Borrowed money can boost a company’s returns when things are good, but sting when business slows. Meanwhile, during a credit crisis, if borrowing costs rise, a highly leveraged company will see its ROIC fall. 
Checking up on a company’s efficiency

Chunk 854 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Checking up on a company’s efficiency
When you invest in a company, you want to know it’s running a tight ship. You don’t want the company taking its time collecting money from customers or letting inventory sit in the warehouse. There are many ratios that can help you figure out how well a company is managing its affairs. 
Accounts receivable turnover

Chunk 855 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Accounts receivable turnover
This ratio tells you how quickly a company is collecting its bills from custom-ers. It’s helpful for many investors to convert this into the number of days it takes to collect the bills. Here’s how: 
 1. Calculate the average accounts receivable. Add the first year’s 
accounts receivable to the second and divide by 2. For Cisco, that’s: 
  $3,905 = $3,821 + $3,989 / 2

Chunk 856 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
$3,905 = $3,821 + $3,989 / 2
13 506455-ch08.indd   12913 506455-ch08.indd   129 9/24/09   10:30:58 PM9/24/09   10:30:58 PM130 Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
 2. Divide the answer in step 1 by revenue. For Cisco, that’s: 
  0.099 = $3,905 / $39,540
 3. Convert step 2 to days by multiplying by 365. For Cisco, that’s: 
  0.099 × 365 = 36
So for Cisco, the number above means it takes, on average, 36 days for the

Chunk 857 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
company to collect its bills from customers. You’ll want to compare this with the industry to see how it compares. 
 It’s valuable to compare a company’s accounts receivable turnover and see if 
it’s getting larger over time. That can be a warning sign that the company is having trouble collecting from customers. 
Inventory turnover

Chunk 858 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Inventory turnover
Inventory turnover tells you how long its takes the company to clear out the goods sitting in the warehouse. The good news is calculating the formula works the same as accounts receivable turnover, except you substitute aver-age inventories with average accounts receivable and cost of goods sold with revenue. 
The formula looks like this: 
Average inventory / cost of goods sold * 365
For Cisco, that’s: 
33.2 = Average inventory ($1,278.50) / cost of goods sold ($14,056) * 365

Chunk 859 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
To get average inventory, add inventory from one year to the previous year, 
and divide by 2.
So, it takes Cisco 33.2 days to clear inventory from its warehouses. That’s 
pretty standard. You’ll want to be careful of companies if the days to clear inventory is rising at a rapid clip or stretches well above 40 days.
It takes longer to clear inventory in some industries than others. For

Chunk 860 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
instance, a shipbuilding company may hold inventory for a longer time before it’s sold. That’s why it’s important to track the company over time to see if the number of days to clear inventory is rising. 
Accounts payable turnover
With this measure, accounts payable turnover, you can find out how long a company is taking to pay its bills. You don’t want to invest in a deadbeat

Chunk 861 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
13 506455-ch08.indd   13013 506455-ch08.indd   130 9/24/09   10:30:58 PM9/24/09   10:30:58 PM131  Chapter 8: Using Financial Ratios to Pinpoint Investments
company that’s not paying its bills, since it might find itself getting cut off 
from suppliers. Here’s how to calculate accounts payable turnover, converted into days:
 1. Calculate the average accounts payable. Add the first year’s accounts 
payable to the second year’s, and divide by 2. 
  For Cisco, that’s $827.5 = $869+$786 / 2

Chunk 862 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
For Cisco, that’s $827.5 = $869+$786 / 2
 2. Calculate the increase, or decrease, in inventory. Subtract the previ-
ous year’s inventory by the first year’s to see if the company added or removed from its stockpiles. For Cisco, that’s: $1,235 – $1322 = –$87. That means Cisco drew down its inventory. 
 3. Add the answer from step 2 to the company’s cost of goods sold. For 
Cisco, that’s $13,969 = -87 + $14,056
 4. Divide the answer from step 1 by the answer of step 3. For Cisco, that’s

Chunk 863 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
0.059 = 827.5 / 13,969
 5. Multiply the answer from step 4 by 365 to convert to days. For Cisco, 
that’s 21.6. 
So it looks like Cisco is a prompt payer of its bills. You should get worried if you see the number of days rising over time and heading considerably over 35 days. 
 A rapid accounts payable turnover ratio may indicate the company is comfort-
able with its short-term cash flows. If you see this slow down, it could be a sign the company is trying to bolster its short-term cash.

Chunk 864 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Evaluating companies’ financial condition
No one wants to give money to a deadbeat. If your neighbor hits you up for money, you probably have no idea if you’ll ever get it back. But with a com-pany, there are very concrete ratios that can indicate how able a company is to repay you. Some of those include the following. 
Debt to equity

Chunk 865 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Debt to equity
The debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most basic measures of a company’s debt load. It tells you, at a glance, how a company’s pile of debt compares with the amount of money it has raised from stock investors. The higher the number, the more loaded it is with debt relative to stock. The formula is: 
Current portion of long-term debt + long-term debt / total equity × 100
For Cisco, that’s 20.1 = ($500 + $6,393) / $34,353 × 100

Chunk 866 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
13 506455-ch08.indd   13113 506455-ch08.indd   131 9/24/09   10:30:58 PM9/24/09   10:30:58 PM132 Part II: How To Perform Fundamental Analysis 
So for every $20 that the company has borrowed, it has raised $100 from

Chunk 867 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
equity investors. That’s a very low level of debt, especially if you consider that during the mid-2000s, companies in the S&P 500 had borrowed $75 for every $100 raised from investors. Generally, you don’t want to see companies borrowing much more than $100 for every $100 raised from investors. 
Quick ratio

Chunk 868 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Quick ratio
When you want to size up how well-equipped a company is to handle its short-term cash obligations, the current ratio does a great job. You can re-read how to calculate the current ratio in Chapter 6. 
But some might think the current ratio is too lenient. After all, it includes the

Chunk 869 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
value of inventory. Some fundamental analysts think including inventory isn’t a great idea, since you can’t exactly sell off raw materials very easily to pay bills. That’s where the quick ratio comes in. It disregards inventory to help you really see how able a company is at meeting short-term obligations. The formula is: 
Cash and cash equivalents + investments + accounts receivable / current 
liabilities
For Cisco, that’s: 
2.2 = $5,191+ $21,044 + $3821 / $13,858

Chunk 870 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
2.2 = $5,191+ $21,044 + $3821 / $13,858
That means that the company has $2.20 in assets that are already cash or can 
be easily turned into cash to handle liabilities due in a year. That is a very strong position, given that in the mid-2000s, companies in the S&P 500 had $1.21 in very close-to-cash assets for every $1 in liabilities coming due in a year. You want to see this ratio be at least 1, and preferably higher. 
Interest coverage ratio

Chunk 871 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Interest coverage ratio
The interest coverage ratio helps you figure out how well a company is able to afford its interest payments. 
This ratio can be calculated in many ways. Generally, you compare the com-

Chunk 872 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
pany’s profits before interest costs and taxes to its interest expense, to see how able it is to pay its bills. It’s similar to how you’re supposed to compare your monthly gross pay with your monthly mortgage bill to see if you can afford the house. Too bad more people didn’t do this ahead of the financial crisis, but I digress. 
Just divide EBIT by the company’s interest expense. For Cisco, that’s: 
29.6 = $9,445 / 319

Chunk 873 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
29.6 = $9,445 / 319
13 506455-ch08.indd   13213 506455-ch08.indd   132 9/24/09   10:30:59 PM9/24/09   10:30:59 PM133  Chapter 8: Using Financial Ratios to Pinpoint Investments
Reflecting the fact it has very low debt, Cisco has a very high interest cover-
age ratio. It generates nearly $30 in available cash profits to pay for every $1 in interest due. Most companies, on average, only generated about $15 in avail-able cash profits to pay their interest. The higher the ratio, the better.

Chunk 874 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Some companies, including Cisco, list their interest expense as a footnote in 
their 10-K. After opening the 10-K, using the instructions in Chapter 4, just search for the words “interest expense” and you’ll turn up the amount. 
Getting a handle on a company’s valuation

Chunk 875 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Getting a handle on a company’s valuation 
When you hear investors talk about whether or not a company is cheap, often times they’re referring to a stock’s valuation. There are dozens of valu-ation ratios, sometimes called multiples, to help you figure out how pricey a stock is. 
More often than not, the ratio used to measure a stock’s valuation is the

Chunk 876 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
price-to-earnings ratio, or P-E. The P-E is so important, I dedicate the next section to it. But for now, below are some descriptions of valuation ratios other than the P-E.
Price-to-book ratio
Many serious fundamental analysts pay closest attention to the price-to-book ratio. This ratio compares a company’s stock price to its book value, or value of everything the company owes, free and clear of debt. The formula for price-to-book is:

Chunk 877 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Price-to-book = Company’s stock price / (shareholders’ equity / number of shares outstanding)
To practice, let’s take the day that Cisco reported its fiscal 2008 results on July 28, 2008. The stock price closed at $21.98. So its price-to-book ratio was: 
3.94 = $21.98 / ($34,353 / 6,163)

Chunk 878 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
3.94 = $21.98 / ($34,353 / 6,163) 
The higher the price-to-book ratio, the more investors are paying up for the companies’ assets. The ratio will rise and fall as investors get more confident or less confident about the company and the stock market. 
 How do you know if a stock’s price-to-book is high or low? One easy way is

Chunk 879 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
comparing it with the price-to-book of stocks inside exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, which are baskets of stocks. iShares, for instance, has an ETF that tracks stocks with high, average and low price-to-book ratios. Stocks with low price-to-book ratios are called value stocks. And stocks with high price-to-book ratios are called growth stocks. There’s no set definition of what defines a high or low book value, and it changes over time.

You can look up the average price-to-book ratios of large value stocks by

Chunk 881 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
entering IVV in the Ticker or Keyword blank at ishares.com. And you can see the average price-to-book ratios of large growth stocks by entering IVW. In early 2000, stocks in the S&P 500 had an average price-to-book of 3.1, while stocks with high price-to-book ratios averaged 3.66. I’ll give you more point-ers on how to do this in Chapter 10.
Dividend yield

Chunk 882 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The dividend yield tells you how much the company is paying out in cash dividends relative to the stock price. You can calculate a dividend yield by dividing the amount of dividends a company pays out in a year by its stock price, and then multiplying by 100. So if a company pays $1 a year in divi-dends and has a stock price of $25 a share, it has a dividend yield of 4%. To put this dividend into perspective, remember large companies have paid an average dividend yield of 3.8% since December

Chunk 883 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
an average dividend yield of 3.8% since December 1936, says S&P.

Chunk 884 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
In theory, the dividend yield is the cash payout you receive by holding onto a 
stock. Some investors are tempted to automatically buy stocks that pay large dividend yields. However, dividends can be cut with little notice. In fact, com-panies with large dividend yields are often those under the most distress. 
Earnings yield

Chunk 885 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
A company’s earnings yield tells you how much, as a percentage of a stock’s price, the company is generating in profit. The earnings yield gives you a way to compare a company’s profit generation with other investments. To get a stock’s earnings yield, divide a stock’s earnings per share over the past 12 months by its stock price. When a stock’s earnings yield is well below the market or that of rivals, it might be a sign the stock is overvalued. I’ll touch on this topic more in Chapter 10.

Chunk 886 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The earnings yield is especially valuable when trying to determine if the stock 
market is overvalued. You can get this by dividing the earnings generated by the S&P 500 over the previous 12 months by the value of the S&P 500. When the yield gets lower than what you can get by putting your money in safer securities, like government bonds, it’s a warning you’re not getting paid for the risk you’re assuming. 
Getting Familiar With the 
Price-To-Earnings Ratio

Chunk 887 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Price-To-Earnings Ratio
The granddaddy of all financial ratios must be the P-E. The P-E is an appeal-
ing ratio, because it’s relatively easy to understand and can be used to com-pare the valuations of different companies with each other and to the market at large.

How to Calculate the P-E

Chunk 888 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
How to Calculate the P-E
When people refer to a stock’s P-E, it’s almost as if it’s some sort of number 
that’s etched in stone. Nothing could be further from the truth. A stock’s P-E changes every day along with a stock’s price. The formula is deceptively simple: 
P–E = Stock price / earnings per share

Chunk 889 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
P–E = Stock price / earnings per share
The numerator, the stock price, everyone can pretty much agree on. That’s set by the stock market and can be looked up. However, the denominator can be many different things and is subject to some interpretation. And that’s why there can be several variants of the P-E including the:

Chunk 890 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Trailing P-E: When you divide a stock’s price by its net earnings per share over the past 12 months’ earnings, or trailing earnings, you get the trailing P-E. This is considered one of the most conservative ways to measure P-E, since it’s based on earnings that have actually been reported.
  Net earnings per share can be measured a few ways, as discussed in 
Chapter 5.

Chunk 891 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Chapter 5.  
 ✓ Current P-E: When you divide a stock’s price by what it’s expected to earn in the current fiscal year, that’s the current P-E. Typically, the forward P-E will be based on several quarters of earnings reported by the company, plus a few quarters of estimated earnings. This is a fairly common way to measure a stock’s P-E.

Chunk 892 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Forward P-E: When you divide a stock’s price by what it’s expected to earn in the next fiscal year, you’re taking somewhat of a leap. Estimates can be pretty unreliable going out this far, meaning that investors should take the forward P-E with a handful of salt.

Chunk 893 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Operating P-E: When you divide by a company’s operating income, you are trying to get an idea of what investors are paying for the company’s profit, excluding unusual and one-time charges. Current and forward P-E ratios are usually based on operating income, since these rely on esti-mates. There is usually no way to accurately forecast one-time charges.

Chunk 894 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ As reported P-E: When you divide by a company’s net income, which includes all charges and one-time items. Reported P-E tends to be higher than operating P-Es during times of economic stress, since companies take many charges for restructuring. 
 If someone is trying to sell you on a stock by pointing to its “low P-E,” be care-

Chunk 895 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
ful you know how it’s being calculated. Future P-Es are infamously too low, making a stock look cheap, since the denominator may be based on an overly optimistic estimate.

What a P-E tells you about a stock
One of the beauties of the P-E ratio is its simplicity. With just one number,

Chunk 896 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
you can find out how much investors, on average, are willing to pay for a claim to $1 of a company’s earnings. 
The higher the P-E, the loftier the company’s valuation is. When you see a P-E 
get high relative to peers in the same industry, you might begin to wonder if investors are overvaluing the stock. Similarly, if you see a stock’s P-E fall below that of its peers, you might wonder if the company can make changes to its operations to win a higher multiple.

Chunk 897 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The long-term average P-E of stocks is about 15. If a stock rises above that, you 
need to be aware that you might be paying up for the stock. Be sure you’re get-ting something for that extra price, such as growth. The PEG ratio, discussed below, explores how to adjust P-E to factor in a company’s growth. 
Putting the P-E into perspective

Chunk 898 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Now that you know how to measure a stock’s P-E, the question is, what does it mean? The first thing you should do is compare a stock’s P-E against the P-E of other companies in the same industry. You can calculate the P-Es of industries yourself, or if you want to save yourself trouble, use Web sites that do it for you. Reuters (www.reuters.com/finance/stocks) has a powerful ratio calcula-tor. Enter the stock’s symbol in the black, select the “Ratios” option and click the Go button. You’ll get

Chunk 899 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
option and click the Go button. You’ll get the stock’s P-E based on trailing earnings, as well as the P-E for the industry and the S&P 500. This gives you something to com-pare the stock’s P-E with, without having to do a single division problem.

Chunk 900 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Taking the P-E to the next level: The PEG
It’s not uncommon for stocks with high P-Es to keep going higher. Many times, investors are willing to pay higher prices for companies that are grow-ing more rapidly. Much of that has to do with the way the P-E is measured. 
Imagine a company, which earned $1 a share, is trading for $20 a share. It has

Chunk 901 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
a P-E of 20, which might seem lofty if the rest of the stock market has a P-E of 15. But what if a year from now, the company’s earnings rise by 30 percent? If the stock is still $20 a share, that means it would have a P-E of 15, which would be in line with the market. So in a way, the stock wasn’t all that over-valued because it grows into its valuation.

Chunk 902 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
13 506455-ch08.indd   13613 506455-ch08.indd   136 9/24/09   10:30:59 PM9/24/09   10:30:59 PM137  Chapter 8: Using Financial Ratios to Pinpoint Investments
The importance of a company’s growth rate is one reason for the PEG ratio. 
The PEG compares a stock’s P-E to its expected growth rate. You simply

Chunk 903 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
divide the stock’s P-E by the expected growth rate. You can estimate a com-pany’s growth rate yourself by examining historical increases in revenue and earnings, as described in Chapter 5. Or you can read analysts’ reports, which forecast growth, as explained in Chapter 14. 
 Investors generally consider a stock to be pricey if it has a PEG of 2 or more. 
Some investors also find a stock becomes attractive when its PEG falls below 1.

Chunk 904 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Sometimes, patience can be a virtue when using the PEG. During the severe

Chunk 905 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
market contraction of 2008, even some of the market’s hottest stocks saw their PEG ratios plummet below 1. Internet darling Google surprised inves-tors when its PEG fell below 1 in early 2009, as its stock price fell to $340, giving it a current P-E of 16. Meanwhile, the company’s expected growth rate was 18.4%. Divide the P-E of 16 by the expected growth rate of 18.4, and you arrive at a PEG of 0.87. Investors who avoided the hoopla and watched the PEG got a much better valuation on the stock.

the PEG got a much better valuation on the stock.

Chunk 907 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Evaluating the P-E of the entire market
One of the most valuable things about the P-E is that it is constantly evolving as stock prices move. Unlike other fundamental ratios, which are based on fun-damental data from previous quarters, the P-E changes as stock prices move.

The P-E of a stock can also be compared against the constantly changing P-E

Chunk 909 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
of the entire stock market. Knowing the P-E of the market is very valuable, because it lets you see how pricey, or cheap, a company’s stock is compared with the market.

Getting up to Speed with What 
the Proxy Statement Is
Every year, public companies hold giant shareholder meetings. Annual share-
holder meetings give management the opportunity to lay out the company’s strategic plan going forward. 
 The strategic plan is of upmost importance to shareholders because that will

Chunk 914 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
describe what kinds of products and services the company plans to push, and also how the company plans to finance  the production and selling of those products and services. Certain matters are also brought to a vote during the shareholder meetings. I discuss the annual shareholder meeting, and ways to analyze them, in more detail in Chapter 13. 
This section unearths the proxy statement, which is the document compa-

Uncovering info in the proxy statement

Chunk 916 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The proxy statement is intended to brief investors on all the matters that are subject to a vote, in addition to other issues investors must be informed of. These documents are stuffed full of details that normally aren’t dis-cussed, including sensitive topics of how much executives are being paid. Fundamental analysts may be focused on the company’s overall financial performance, but the proxy is worth paying attention to because it provides information about the:

Chunk 917 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Management’s experience: Fundamental analysts want to have a good handle on the people who are running the company. Detailed biogra-phies of the management team are provided in the proxy. 
 ✓ Board of director composition: If you invest in a company, the board of directors is your watchdog. This group is assigned the task of watching over the management team and making changes to the people or overall strategy when needed.

 ✓ Conflicts of interest: A conflict of interest occurs when someone in the 
role of watching over the company may have a reason not to be very vigilant. Such potential conflicts must be broken out in the proxy.

But now, whether you own a stock or not, it’s pretty simple to just download the proxy for free. The best way to obtain a proxy statement is by using the Securities and Exchange Commission’s IDEA database.

Chunk 934 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Appreciating corporate governance 
If there’s one overarching theme of what to look for in the proxy, it’s cor-porate governance. Corporate governance is a catch-all term to describe the safeguards a company has in place to make sure that the management of the company is acting in the best interest for the shareholders. It’s the way public companies deal with one of the greatest pitfalls of our financial system: the agency dilemma.

The basic idea of the agency dilemma is the fact that the people who own the

Chunk 936 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
company aren’t the ones necessarily running it. When you buy 100 shares of a company, for instance, you’re not given the right to tell the company what kinds of products it should sell. You’re surrendering those key business deci-sions to the hired hands that run the business. And that includes the CEO and the rest of the management team, such as the chief financial officer and chief operating officer. 
Not surprisingly, when there are hired hands running an enterprise on behalf

Chunk 937 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
of the owners, there’s a potential for problems. And that’s the case with com-panies, too. That’s where corporate governance comes in. Companies are required to have a team of business experts, called a board of directors, that are supposed to watch over the management team.

 Pay close attention to how many corporate boards the directors sit on. As

For instance, GE disclosed that a number of the board members were connected with companies that did business with GE. But the relationships were tested to ensure that none of the companies received more than 2% of their total revenue from GE.
GE, as required by regulations, further disclosed

Chunk 952 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
that none of the members of the audit commit-tee received any sort of compensation from the company other than director fees. Director fees, or payments made to directors, will be explored in more detail later in this chapter.

Delving into the board’s committees
The key aspect of this part of the proxy is to highlight which board members

Chunk 953 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
sit on which committees. You’ll want to pay very close attention to who is sitting on the audit committee, since this is the group of people that’s suppos-edly there to protect you from accounting fraud. 
 When looking over all the directors on the board, you want to pay particular 
attention to the members of the audit committee. Make sure they are finan-cially literate. A look at their biographies will give you a decent idea if they’re qualified for this extremely important job.

Chunk 954 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
In addition to the competence of board members, you want to look for 
involvement and participation. In this section of the proxy, companies will often disclose how many times the members of the board met during the year. You want to see the board meeting at least four times a year, or once a quarter. In 2008, GE disclosed the board met 22 times. 
You also want to make sure that the board members are actually showing

Chunk 955 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
up for the meetings. If you see multiple members missing 25% or more of the meetings, you might be concerned that they’re not paying close enough attention to the matters at hand. 
Finding potential conflicts between 
the board and the company
Most proxy statements will contain a section, often called related-person 
transactions or related-party transactions, which outlines any business relation-
ships board members have with the company they’re overseeing.

Chunk 956 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
If you don’t read anything else in a proxy, always check out the related-party

Chunk 957 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
transaction section. This is where a company must lay out any potentially sweet deals it has going with its officers and directors. Fundamental analysts who read this section of Enron’s proxy statements got an early warning of some of the strange dealings between the company and its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. While many of the key details were left out, accord-ing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, there was enough of a vague description of the relationship between Fastow

Understanding how the board is paid
The board of directors isn’t overseeing the company you’ve invested in out 
of the kindness of its heart. The board members get paid, sometimes hand-somely, for the service. Luckily, the payments received by directors are dis-closed for all to see.

Chunk 960 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Pay for board members is a delicate balance. On one hand, you don’t want to see board members receiving excessive compensation. If payment is over the top, the board members have an incentive to keep their mouths shut and not risk their gravy train by raising objections. However, qualified and savvy businesspeople aren’t going to take the risk of sitting on a board for nothing. Sometimes you get what you pay for. 
Just as you compare a company’s net income and profit to its peers, you

Chunk 961 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
can do the same with board members’ pay. For instance, the median board member at companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 in 2008 earned nearly $200,000, says The Corporate Library. That was an increase of roughly 12%. Keep your eyes open for sudden increases of pay to board members. A big spike in pay might indicate the company is trying to ensure a very amicable board of directors.

Chunk 962 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
While it’s helpful to compare how much directors get paid with the average of companies in the S&P 500, it’s really best to compare against similar compa-nies of comparable size. Sometimes disparities can be telling. For instance, the lead director at Freddie Mac, the lending entity that was essentially taken over by the government in 2008, was paid $100,000. That was well above the going rate of roughly $30,000 for directors at comparable companies, The Corporate Library says.

Chunk 963 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Sometimes board members are paid in cash. Sometimes they receive stock. 
Most of the time, though, they receive both cash and stock. And in some cases, companies may provide additional perks to board members. At GE in 2008, for instance, board members were permitted to receive GE appliances and other products, take part in programs to give gifts to charity, and enjoy events for the directors and their spouses. 
 While it might seem like a potential conflict of interest for the board members

Chunk 964 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
to take freebies from a company, just pay attention to the total amount of com-pensation. Be sure that the company clearly discloses all the benefits direc-tors receive, including the perks, and make sure they’re not excessive.

Auditing the auditor
While the board of directors is supposed to be your closest ally in the board-

Chunk 965 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
room, luckily, even the board has someone watching it: the auditor. The auditing firm has the job of checking over the books and records of a com-pany to make sure it’s representing everything accurately.
But it’s kind of up to you, again, to make sure the auditor is on your side. One

Chunk 966 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
of the biggest inherent potential conflicts with an auditing firm is the fact it is paid by the company to provide the audited results. That’s a conflict that you kind of have to live with, since that’s how the system works. 
 If you see that the auditing firm is getting paid for all sorts of other services

Chunk 967 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
for the company besides conducting the audit, you should get concerned. You could imagine a situation where an auditing firm would get so reliant on these extra fees, it might not be as diligent as it should be. After all, Arthur Andersen had a very extensive relationship with Enron, which some say might have con-tributed to the auditor not raising flags at the company. 
Luckily, the proxy makes digging up these kinds of details relatively easy. At

Chunk 968 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the bottom of the proxy, the company must disclose all the fees it paid to its auditing firm. The fees are organized into:
 ✓ Audit fees: These are the direct costs the company pays to the audit firm for reviewing its books, including the 10-K. 
 ✓ Audit-related fees: These are fees generally connected to the audit pro-cess, typically a review of the company’s financial controls. 
 ✓ Tax fees: Companies will often tap their auditing firm for tips on ways to manage their tax bills.

Chunk 969 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ All other fees: Here’s the line item you want to pay close attention to. These “other” fees include consulting fees for information technology services and other advisory services that have nothing to do with the company’s audit.

Chunk 970 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
It’s usually best when a company has a minimal amount, if not $0, in the line for all other fees paid to the auditing firm. You want to make sure the auditor is looking out for you, not itself and its partners’ profits. In 2008, GE paid no fees outside of audit, audit-related and tax to its auditing firm, KPMG. GE also disclosed that the KPMG partners in charge of auditing it must be rotated at least every five years. That reduces the chances of the partners getting too cozy with GE

If you want to get a list of the biggest owners of a stock who aren’t officers or directors, that information is available elsewhere as I’ll describe in Chapter 14.

How Much Are We Paying You? 
Understanding Executive Compensation 
Some fundamental analysts might think examining executive compensation 
is a distraction. After all, the salaries of all a company’s employees, including the CEO and management team, are subtracted from revenue to arrive at net 
income. Certainly, if a CEO’s pay was completely outlandish, the profitability of the firm would fall and tip off fundamental analysts that way.

Chunk 976 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Even so, a key part of fundamental analysis is understanding the motives and 
ethics of the management team. After all, you’re entrusting this team of men and women to take your money and invest it productively in ways to gener-ate a return for you. If your money is being siphoned off for the big cheese to enrich himself, that’s a problem for a fundamental analyst. 
Studying executive compensation is a detailed science that could fill many

books. And every year, major publications such as USA TODAY release com-prehensive executive compensation reports that give you an idea of what’s reasonable or excessive.

might get the answer, “It’s none of your business.” And that’s probably the case. But guess what. Since you’re technically paying the CEO’s salary, as an investor, it is your business to know what he or she is paid. 
14 506455-ch09.indd   15014 506455-ch09.indd   150 9/24/09   10:31:52 PM9/24/09   10:31:52 PM151  Chapter 9: Mining the Proxy Statement for Investment Clues
 CEOs don’t typically just get a paycheck every couple of weeks. Generally,

Chunk 982 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
they receive a base salary plus a number of bonuses and other incentives that become valuable if they meet certain performance milestones. That’s why most CEOs’ pay is broken into these parts: 
 ✓ Salary: This is the base pay received by the executive. 
 ✓ Bonus: These discretionary payments are generally awarded at the end of the year for meeting certain performance targets.

Chunk 983 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Equity awards: Top executives will often be given compensation that’s tied to the company’s stock price. These grants may become very valu-able if the company’s stock price rises in the future. Equity awards are generally stock options or restricted stock, which are both described in more detail below.

Chunk 984 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
For instance, in 2008, GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt received a salary of $3.3 million and equity awards of $2.0 million for total compensation of $5.3 million. GE is one of the few companies to meticulously outline the goals the CEO needed to meet in order to earn bonuses and other incentive pay. 
 You can tell something about executives’ motives by the way they handle their

Chunk 985 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
bonuses. Immelt, for instance, asked GE’s board of directors not to pay him a bonus in 2008 due to the dramatic fall of the company’s stock price. The board accepted the suggestion, even though GE meet the operational targets that were conditions for the bonus. The denial of the bonus cost Immelt millions, since his bonus was $5.8 million in 2007. Immelt also declined a $11.7 million long-term performance award. 
On the other hand, former Merrill Lynch CEO Thain was subpoenaed to dis-

Where the real money comes from:

Just as restaurants make most of their money on the drinks, not the food, 
CEOs don’t make most of their money from where you might think. Salaries for most executives, by and large, aren’t where the vast majority of CEOs’ Going beyond the proxy to find executive perks

Chunk 989 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Just as you might negotiate for access to child-care or extra vacation time accepting a new job, the same goes for executives. Executives of large companies will very often seek non-monetary extras as part of their pay. These extras can range from a home-office setup to paid consult-ing gigs after retirement, paid insurance premi-ums or tickets to sporting events. 
It’s important for a fundamental analysts to

Chunk 990 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

pay attention to these perks, because they are a factor in determining an executive’s total compensation. 
When these extras are large enough the

Chunk 991 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
company should, in theory, disclose them in the proxy statement. But as you’ve probably noticed so far, companies go out of their way to keep details on executive pay as general as possible and not list or itemize specific perks. Most of these items are rolled up into a broad category in the proxy, usually called “other” or something vague. You can often find “other” pay listed in a table in the company’s proxy. Some companies go a bit further and break out the value of certain expected perks

Chunk 992 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
and break out the value of certain expected perks executives receive such as use of aircraft, cars or financial or tax planning.

Chunk 993 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
And that’s why keen fundamental analysts 
interested in executive pay often find they must look beyond the proxy. Don’t get me wrong, the proxy is extremely valuable and should be your starting point when researching executive pay. But remember companies will only go so far in listing details on perks executives are getting. And that’s why you need to know how to take your research one step further to get the full story on executive pay. 
The first place to check after the proxy are court

Chunk 994 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

Chunk 995 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
One of the best examples of how you can get

Court papers from Welch’s 2002 divorce from his wife of 13 years revealed many never-before-seen details of perks Welch received from GE in retirement. Some of the perks included use of a multi-mil-lion dollar New York City apartment, a limo and security for his homes.

Chunk 998 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
compensation comes from. Instead, it’s from stock options. Stock options are 
financial instruments that give their owners the right, but not the obligation, to buy a stock at a predetermined price. 
 Options are common tools to incentivize executives. For instance, a CEO

Chunk 999 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
might get an option to buy 100,000 shares of a stock for $30 a share when the company’s stock price is $30. If the CEO is successful and the stock price rises to $50 a share, the CEO may exercise the option and buy 100,000 shares of stock worth $5 million, for $3 million. The difference, the $2 million, goes to the executive as compensation. 
CEOs might also receive restricted stock. These shares are given to an execu-

Chunk 1000 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
tive, but cannot be sold unless certain criteria are met, typically after a period of time has lapsed. Restricted stock is designed to dangle a carrot in front of the CEO as an incentive to keep them at the company and working hard to increase the stock price and returns to shareholders. 
Checking In on Your Fellow Shareholders

Chunk 1001 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Checking In on Your Fellow Shareholders
When you buy a stock, you don’t get a directory of all the other investors in the company. You’re free to attend a company’s shareholders’ meeting and do some glad-handing. But with that said, the proxy statement can be a useful tool in figuring out what executives are also big shareholders in the company. 
Finding out who else owns the stock

Chunk 1002 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Finding out who else owns the stock
Determining other investors who own a stock can be somewhat telling. For instance, if you are a value investor, looking to buy stocks at low valuations, you might take comfort in seeing whether any well-known mutual fund managers own a stock. You’ll find out how to check in on these investors’ moves in Chapter 17.
But some investors take comfort when the officers and directors own large

Chunk 1003 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
positions in a stock, since they have some skin in the game and therefore stand to lose personally if the stock price falls. 
The proxy is again your best friend in finding out whether the company’s 
management is willing to eat its own cooking, so to speak. Most proxy state-ments contain a table, usually close to the bottom of the document, which spells out how many shares the officers and directors of the company own.

Chunk 1004 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Some officers and directors feel so strongly a company’s stock price is about to rise that they may buy the company’s stock with their own money. These types of buys are viewed as bullish signals, because executives are reaching into their own pockets to buy shares, rather than receiving handouts as part of compensation packages.

Shareholder proposals
The proxy lists all the items of business that are up for a shareholder vote. 
The items may be presented by either the company or shareholders. 
Generally, the issues presented by companies are pretty mundane. More 
often than not, they pertain to one of the following items: 
 ✓ Vote for board members up for re-election. Shareholders may either vote for each nominated candidate or withhold their vote.

Chunk 1007 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Approve the company’s auditing firm. Often, this is just an exercise of going through the motions, since companies tend to use the same accounting firm each year. 
 ✓ Authorize the issuance of shares connected with stock incentive plans. 
 The most interesting proposals in the proxy are almost always the ones

Chunk 1008 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
brought up by shareholders, called shareholder proposals. Some shareholders will go to the time and trouble to add items to the proxy for other sharehold-ers to consider. While many of the items can be frivolous, many times they can signal to you, the fundamental analyst, concerns that other investors might have. These items might direct you to do further analysis on some portion of the financial statements. 
Following the stock market crash in 2008, a number of shareholder propos-

Chunk 1009 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
als were directed at companies for issues ranging from excessive executive pay to concern about board with over-boarded directors. Many 2008 proxies raised the issue of say on pay, a proposal which would allow shareholders to directly approve the pay packages offered to executives. Shareholder resolu-tions also often target golden parachutes, or lucrative payouts to executives after they lose their job, including following a buyout by another firm. These proposals might be a gentle nudge for

The defenses companies provide can offer useful insight for fundamental analysts.

The shareholder claimed the four separate companies housed inside GE would be

Chunk 1013 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
four separate companies housed inside GE would be worth 30% more than the combined GE. The company’s defense outlined a number of divestitures the company made to streamline itself.

rarely is there a single factor that flashes a bright light to tell you that it’s time to buy. As a fundamental analyst, you need to consider a variety of traits that, together, might give you an idea if it’s worth taking a shot on a stock. 
Fundamental analysts often concentrate on a few aspects of a stock, which 
might make it an attractive investment, including:

Chunk 1023 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Staying power: You want to make sure a company has the financial resources to endure a downturn and come out on the other side. 
 ✓ The trajectory of the fundamentals: Since a stock price, over time, is connected to a company’s revenue and earnings, fundamental analysts try to see improving trends in the company’s revenue and profit. Trend spotting will be discussed at more length in Chapter 17.

Chunk 1024 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Evidence of skilled management: A management team with experience navigating through the ups and downs of a business may give the funda-mental analyst more confidence in the company’s future. Skilled manag-ers can protect their company’s business from competition with strong brands, service or quality.

Chunk 1025 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Valuation: Even if a company is performing poorly, the stock can still be a good investment if the bad news is already reflected in the price. Fundamental analysts spend a great deal of their time comparing a company’s current stock price to its real value, based on what they think it’s worth. You discovered how to use the P-E as a valuation tool in Chapter 8, and in this chapter you’ll find out about the earnings yield. 
Fundamental analysts also look for good values using the discounted

Chunk 1026 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
cash-flow model, explored in Chapter 11. 
 ✓ Dividend payments: These seemingly small cash payments can quickly add up and become a significant consideration for a fundamental ana-lyst. Fundamental analysts also use these dividends as a way to measure the attractiveness of some stocks, as will be discussed at the end of this chapter.

You’re not the only one with instant access to a company’s financial state-ments and performance.

All this means that many investors who try to

Liquidity: Cash is king
If you’re trying to buy into a company on the cheap, you want to make sure it has the ability to weather the difficult times. And that calls for a close exami-nation of liquidity, or ready access to cash. Make sure you pay close atten-tion to a company’s current ratio, as described in Chapter 6. This is a good approximation of whether a company will be able to raise enough cash to pay its bills due in a year.

Chunk 1038 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
There’s a very important pecking order to investing you need to be very aware

Low debt loads and big piles of cash 
When you’re looking for cheap stocks of companies that may survive, be certain to consider the companies that have little to no debt. Companies that don’t have an enormous amount of money to repay can tread water and get their operations in order before they have to worry about meeting oner-ous interest costs. Pay close attention to a company’s interest coverage ratio,

Chunk 1042 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
described in Chapter 8. The lower this ratio, the better the company will be able to handle a downturn. And make sure the total amount of debt a com-pany owes is reasonable. Again, Chapter 8 will help you access this by con-sidering the debt-to-equity ratio. 
Don’t think it’s possible to run a company without borrowing? Believe it.

Chunk 1043 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Table 10-1 shows some of the largest U.S. companies in the S&P 500 that had no long-term debt at the end of 2008 and that also saw their shares outper-form the market. Many of these companies were in relatively strong financial shape going into the brutal market correction of 2008 and 2009.

 One trick that some fundamental analysts use to get a decent idea of the finan-

Chunk 1046 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
cial bedrock of a company is to compare its stock price to the amount of cash per share it has. Sometimes stocks get beaten up so badly, the company actu-ally has more cash in the bank than its value in the stock market. This analysis is a good complement to studying a company’s price-to-book ratio, which also considers how much debt a company has, as discussed in Chapter 8.
To compare a stock’s price to its cash per share, follow these steps:

Chunk 1047 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
1. Obtain a company’s total cash and cash equivalents. These data are 
available on a company’s balance sheet. If you’re not sure how to get this information, there are detailed instructions in Chapter 6.
 2. Divide the number from Step 1 by the number of shares outstanding. You can get a company’s number of shares outstanding from the balance sheet, too. The step gives you the company’s cash per share.
 3. Divide the answer from Step 1 by the answer in Step 2. If the answer

Chunk 1048 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
is a negative number, that means the company has more in cash than its value in the stock market. Some consider this to be a potential sign the stock is undervalued.

 When a stock price falls below a company’s cash per share, don’t assume it’s a

Chunk 1049 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
screaming buy. Sometimes a stock price gets beaten below cash levels due to excessive debt. In that case, the cash doesn’t really belong to the company, but to the lenders. That’s why the price-to-book ratio is so helpful, since it considers the role of debt. A stock with a low stock price to debt might also indicate investors have no confidence in the management team. 
Stable cash flows

Chunk 1050 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
If a company is in a stable business where demand is relatively reliable, it may generate ample cash flow to undo many of the challenges it faces. You can discover how to measure a company’s cash flow in Chapter 7. Unfortunately, many companies with stable cash flow feel inclined to boost their profitability by borrowing. Unfortunately, though, these piles of debt can haunt companies if business slows. Fundamental analysts may look for companies that have stability and the discipline to avoid

Sometimes it’s helpful to consider history to see how fundamental analysis can help you identify attractive opportunities. Think back to 2002. A “Beautiful Mind” won the Best Picture in the Academy Awards. The soundtrack from “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” won a Grammy.

Fundamental analysts, though, knew better. 
Thanks to cost-cutting, the company still reported a profit of $1.9 billion in fiscal 2002, during the industry’s darkest days. In addition, Cisco had a pile of cash and no debt during the entire tech crisis in the early 2000s, mean-ing it had no interest expense to deal with. And Cisco’s cash flow from operations, discussed in 
Chapter 7, actually increased during the tech crisis between fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2002.

Chunk 1059 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Fundamental analysts who decided in 2002 
that Cisco would be a survivor were richly rewarded. Investors who bought Cisco in late July 2002, after the end of the company’s fiscal year, ended up seeing their investment rise in value by nearly 120% over the next five years, nearly twice the return of the S&P 500.

Looking for a company on the rise
If there’s one thing many investors can agree on, it’s that they want to see a

Fundamental analysis can be extremely helpful in pinpointing companies

When you invest in a company, you’re not just investing in its brands, prod-ucts, and assets. You’re having faith that the management team is properly equipped to best manage the company to deliver outstanding results. 
Return on equity and return on capital, both discussed in Chapter 8, are the

Return on assets, by itself, is a helpful thing for fundamental analysts to con-sider. It tells you how much profit the company is generating from the assets it has under its control. Return on assets helps you see how well a company is running itself without any financial distortion caused by the use of debt. If you compare a company’s return on assets to that of its peers, using the same techniques applied to return on equity in Chapter 8, you get a good idea of how well the company is

But dissecting return on assets into parts can reveal even more about a com-
pany’s management. To show you want I mean, first consider the formula for return on assets: 
Return on assets = Income / Assets
 Income, in the numerator of the formula above, means different things to dif-ferent fundamental analysts. Some use net income, since it’s easily obtained from the income statement. Yet others use earnings before interest and taxes,

Chunk 1067 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
or EBIT, instead of net income to measure return on assets. You can refresh your memory about the advantages and disadvantages of both net income and EBIT in Chapter 8.

You might try testing out return on assets on industrial company 3M, using 
the company’s 2008 financials summarized in Table 10-2.

Chunk 1068 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Plugging in the numbers in Table 10-2, you determine 3M’s return on assets to 
be 13.8%:
Return on assets ( 0.138) = Income ($3,455) / assets ($25,121)
 You can convert return on assets into a percentage by multiplying the answer 
above by 100 to get 13.8%. 
Certainly, knowing 3M generated a 13.8% return on assets is helpful. That is

Chunk 1069 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
a tremendous return, compared with the rest of the stock market and other industrial conglomerates. During the early 2000s, the average company in the S&P 500 generated a return on assets of 5.8%, and a 3% return was the norm for industrial companies as a group, Reuters says. 
Table 10-2 3M’s Vital Stats for 2008

 It’s one thing to know 3M has a high return on assets. But fundamental analy-
sis helps you figure out why. You can do this analysis by breaking return on 
assets into its pieces. Bear with me as I present to you yet another formula. It’s return on assets broken into its component parts: 
Return on assets = Profit margin ×  asset turnover
And let’s cut that formula down even further to say:

Chunk 1071 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
(Income / assets) = (Income / revenue) ×  (Revenue/ assets)
Once your eyes stop glazing over, you’ll recognize the power of this formula. What it’s telling you is that a company’s return on assets is a function of its profit margin and its asset turnover. A company’s profit margin is how much it keeps in profit from every $1 in sales, discussed at length in Chapter 5. And the asset turnover is how much revenue a company earns from its assets.

Chunk 1072 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
16 506455-ch10.indd   16616 506455-ch10.indd   166 9/24/09   10:33:49 PM9/24/09   10:33:49 PM167  Chapter 10: Looking for Fundamental Reasons to Buy or Sell
 Breaking down the return on assets clearly shows you the two levers a com-
pany can pull to boost its return on assets: profit margins and asset turnover. 
When you plug the numbers from Table 10-2 into the formula, you can see 
that return on assets for 3M breaks into these pieces:

Chunk 1073 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
($3,455 / $25,121) = ($3,455 / $25,269) × ($25,269 / $25,121)
I could have spared you from these formulas. But just as doing your own per-sonal taxes helps you understand how your actions affect your tax bill, break-ing down return on assets lets you see how a company’s management can boost returns to shareholders, which is of great importance in fundamental analysis. Just know that when looking for stocks to buy, find those that are:

Chunk 1074 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Boosting their profit margins: Profit margins, however you measure them, are a key component to a company’s future. 
 ✓ Putting their assets to full use: The more revenue a company can gener-ate from its assets, the better the returns. 
 ✓ Doing everything simultaneously: Even a small improvement in profit margins and a modest improvement in asset use can have an explosive effect on a company’s returns.

of value upside down. In Chapter 9, you found how the P-E is a key tool to understand a stock’s valuation and whether it’s an attractive investment. When you flip the P-E ratio over, and look at the reciprocal, you get what’s called the earnings yield. While the P-E gets all the attention, the earnings yield can also be easier to understand. The earnings yield tells you how much in earnings a company is generating for you.

Dividing the price by the diluted earnings per share, you arrive at a P-E of 11.8 times. If you’d like to review how to calculate a P-E ratio, flip back to Chapter 8, where it’s described in detail.

Knowing When to Bail Out of a Stock
If you thought trying to pick the right time to buy a stock was hard, that’s nothing compared to trying to sell at the right time. Inevitably, when you sell a stock it ends up taking off and doubling; at least it feels that way most of the time. At the same time, you may have been in a situation where you held onto a stock and it just kept falling. 
 Knowing when to sell is tremendously important when you buy and sell indi-

Chunk 1081 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
vidual stocks. When you buy individual stocks, as opposed to buying broad index funds, you’re taking on company-specific risk.  Not only are you subject to the normal ups and downs of the market, but you’re adding the risk that the individual company will make mistakes. For that reason, you need to be very disciplined about when you part ways with a stock. Some investors who apply technical analysis (discussed in Chapter 19), urge you to sell a stock once it falls 10% from your purchase price.

Breaking down some top reasons 
to say bye to a stock
There are many reasons why a fundamental analyst might decide to part with 
a stock. Some of the major ones include: 
 ✓ Decelerating earnings or revenue growth: When you start noticing a company’s growth is stalling out, that can be a warning sign of trouble. Flip ahead to Chapter 17 on ways to isolate trends at a company.

Chunk 1084 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Deteriorating financial ratios: When companies start taking a dramati-cally longer time to collect cash from customers or pay their bills, that can tip you off to trouble. See Chapter 8 for more details on this.

 ✓ Poor corporate governance or questionable management:  If the motives

Chunk 1085 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
of a company’s executives get out of line from those of investors, that can 
be a problem. Chapter 9 will show you how to do this analysis.

Chunk 1086 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Overvaluation: Even good companies can get overvalued. As hard as it is sometimes, you might be best off selling a stock when the company seems like it can do no wrong and the stock price is soaring to unsus-tainable heights. There are many ways for a fundamental analyst to measure valuations. The earnings yield, discussed above, is one way; another is the dividend discount model, discussed below. But don’t forget about the P-E and PEG, discussed in Chapter 8, and the discounted

Chunk 1087 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
cash flow analysis covered in Chapter 11. 
 ✓ Rising risk of default: If you have any questions at all whether a com-pany can pay its debt, sell first and ask questions later. Perhaps the first way to sense this is by analyzing a company’s interest coverage ratio, as described in Chapter 8. But you also want to scour the annual report for the words going concern from the auditors. If the auditors are worried, you should be petrified. I’ll show you where to look for this in Chapter 12.

Chunk 1088 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Chronically missing expectations: Wall Street analysts routinely fore-cast how much they expect a company to earn in a given quarter or year. Companies that miss these expectations are sometimes giving you a heads up that either the stock is too high or the company is struggling. You can read more about this in Chapter 14.

Chunk 1089 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Your appetite for risk has changed: Perhaps you have recently changed jobs or think you’ll need your money sooner than you’d thought. You might consider selling some of your smaller or more speculative stocks, since they tend to be riskier over time.

✓ Inflated price-to-book ratio: The price-to-book ratio, described in Chapter 8, is your first tip-off when a stock is getting driven up too much. The ratio compares the stock price to the value of a company, according to the accountants. The most basic way to think of book value is the total of a company’s assets minus its liabilities. When you see a stock’s price-to-book pull ahead of its industry peers, you might con-sider selling.

Chunk 1093 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Lofty price-to-earnings ratio: Unfortunately, there’s no concrete defini-tion of when a P-E is too high. But one thing’s for sure. When a compa-ny’s P-E gets high relative to the other stocks in the industry, you ought to be concerned and consider selling. Also, if the stock market’s P-E is 15 and your stock’s P-E is above 100, you might consider selling a bit.

Chunk 1094 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

What Dividends Can Tell You about

Companies can, and often do, put their best spin on their financial reports.

Chunk 1096 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
As discussed in Chapters 5 through 7, there are things companies can do to put their results in the best possible light. But there’s one thing companies just can’t fake: dividends.

Dividends are typically cash payments companies make to their sharehold-

Chunk 1097 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
ers. These payments are tangible. You can actually spend them. Dividends are real money that gets deposited into your account. Companies that pay large dividends often get popular during financial scares, as investors take comfort in the fact they’re getting real cash from the company. 
These cash payments, while seemingly small, are very important to the over-

 Don’t confuse a company’s dividend with the interest you might get from a

Chunk 1098 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

Calculating the dividend yield

Chunk 1099 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Calculating the dividend yield
When you hear that GE, for instance, pays a 10-cents-a-share dividend, it doesn’t tell you much. Sure, that means that you might expect to earn 40 cents in dividends in the year, but that’s about it. 
That’s why the dividend yield is such a key aspect of fundamental analysis.

Chunk 1100 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The dividend yield tells you how much cash you’re getting in the form of divi-dends for every $1 you’ve entrusted to the company. If the stock price were to remain flat and do nothing, the dividend yield would be your investment return. The formula for dividend yield looks like this: 
Dividend yield = Annual dividend / Share price
 Fundamental analysts measure the annual dividend in several different ways. 
Some add the actual dividends paid over the past year, while others annual-

Chunk 1101 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
ize the current quarterly dividend, or convert the quarterly dividend into an annual one by multiplying by 4. When a company has recently cut its dividend, it’s best to use the annualized current dividend.
Using GE as an example: 
Dividend yield = (Current quarterly dividend × 4) / Share price ×  100
On Feb. 27, 2009, the day GE cut its dividend, the stock price was $8.51. That 
means the dividend yield was 4.7%, measured this way: 
4.7 = (.10 ×  4) / 8.51 ×  100

Chunk 1102 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
4.7 = (.10 ×  4) / 8.51 ×  100
At 4.7%, GE’s dividend yield, even after the cut, was slightly higher than the S&P’s dividend at the time.

Knowing if you’re going 
to get the dividend
Investors who are investing in a company need to pay close attention to the

Chunk 1103 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
timing of the dividends. Companies are meticulous about which shareholders receive the dividend, and there are several key dates to know about: 
 ✓ Ex-dividend date: This is the date that you must already be a share-holder or buy the stock by in order to make sure you get the dividend.

Chunk 1104 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Date of record: This is the date that the company looks at its records to see who its shareholders are and determines who’s getting the dough. If you bought or own the stock by the ex-dividend date, you’ll be on the list on the date of record. 
 ✓ Payable date: This is the date you actually get your dividend. 
Making sure the company 
can afford the dividend
It might be tempting to look for stocks with the biggest dividend yields. Some

Chunk 1105 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
investors get dollar signs in their eyes, thinking about dividends as their portfolio’s version of money for nothing. There’s just one problem, though. There’s no law saying a company must continue paying the dividend. And if the dividend gets cut, you may be sorely disappointed. 
There’s no for-sure way to know whether a company will cut its dividend.

Chunk 1106 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
However, there are some telltale signs. For instance, if you see a dividend yield creep dramatically above the average for the S&P 500, that can be a tip-off a cut could be on the way. GE’s dividend yield before the February 2009 cut was 14.1%, definitely lofty when the average for the S&P 500 was 3.1% at the end of 2008, S&P says. 
 When you start seeing a company’s dividend yield creep up well above the

Chunk 1107 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
rest of the market, that’s a signal to you that either the dividend yield is about to get cut or the company is in a deeply distressed situation. Keep in mind, though, dividend yields are best compared to like companies. Utilities and banks, for instance, have historically paid larger-than-average dividends and need to be compared to one another. 
Fundamental analysts will often use some financial footwork, called a divi-

Chunk 1108 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
dend payout ratio, to see how affordable a dividend is to the company paying 
it. The formula is: 
Dividend payout ratio = Annual dividend / Diluted earnings per share * 100
16 506455-ch10.indd   17216 506455-ch10.indd   172 9/24/09   10:33:50 PM9/24/09   10:33:50 PM173  Chapter 10: Looking for Fundamental Reasons to Buy or Sell
To calculate GE’s dividend payout ratio, for instance, divide its annual divi-

Chunk 1109 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
dend of 0.40 (40 cents) by the $1.72 a share the company earned in 2008 and multiply by 100 to arrive at 23%. In other words, 23 cents of every $1 in earn-ings are paid out as dividends. A 23% dividend payout ratio is reasonable, but you don’t want to see it creep much higher than that since most companies need to retain some cash to reinvest in themselves. 
 Investors need to be very suspicious when a dividend payout ratio gets to 50%

Chunk 1110 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
or higher. A dividend payout ratio that high might mean the company will not be able to increase the dividend or might have to cut it. 
 Some real-estate companies, including those structured as real-estate invest-ment trusts or REITs, are required to pay out 90% of their earnings as a divi-dend. REITs are a special case, and the dividend payout ratios do not apply. 
Using dividends to put a 
price tag on a company
You can tell a great deal about a company by its dividend policy, or track

Chunk 1111 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
record of either paying a dividend or not. When a company doesn’t pay a dividend, for instance, it’s telling shareholders it still has plenty of profitable ventures to plow its extra cash into. 
But using fundamental analysis, you can get even more information from a 
company’s dividend. Using a technique called the constant dividend model, you can get a rough idea of what a company’s stock price should be based on the dividends the company pays. The formula looks like this:

Chunk 1112 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Value of a stock = (Next year’s dividend) / (Required return – dividend growth rate). 
 You’ll need to make a number of assumptions to use the constant-dividend

Chunk 1113 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
model. First you need to approximate what you think the company’s dividend will be next year. Secondly, you need to estimate what return investors are demanding in exchange for providing their cash to the company. This is a complicated analysis I’ll discuss in more detail in Chapter 11. Lastly, you must guess at what rate the company will increase its dividends in the future. 
At this point, let’s just assume GE plans to pay an annual dividend next year

Chunk 1114 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
of 40 cents a share, investors will demand a return on their money of 11%, and dividends will grow by 8% a year. You can measure the value of the GE’s stock this way: 
Value of stock ($13.33) = 0.40 / (0.11 – 0.08)
16 506455-ch10.indd   17316 506455-ch10.indd   173 9/24/09   10:33:50 PM9/24/09   10:33:50 PM174 Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
If all your assumptions come true, GE’s stock price on February 27 of $8.51 
would appear to be undervalued.

Chunk 1115 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
would appear to be undervalued. 
 If you haven’t noticed, the assumptions you make can dramatically alter the 
results of the constant-dividend model. For instance, if you assume dividends will grow by 3% a year, instead of 8%, the value of the stock falls to $5, which would make the current price appear overvalued. 
Also, the constant-dividend model only works on companies that pay a divi-

Chunk 1116 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
dend. Many smaller or faster growing companies do not pay dividend. With those types of companies, you’ll need to use the discounted cash-flow model, as explored in Chapter 11. 
Dividends are not money in the bank 
Many investors make the grave mistake of thinking dividends paid by companies will keep rolling in year after year. In fact, some inves-tors ask me if it’s safe to replace their savings accounts, which often pay low interest rates, for dividend-paying stocks.

Chunk 1117 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
There’s certainly a case to be made for divi-

Chunk 1118 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
dend paying stocks. Even if you’re an income investor, or someone looking for regular cash payments from your investments to pay bills, dividend paying stocks can make sense. Not only do dividend paying stocks give you a shot at making extra money if the stock’s price rises, very often, companies might increase their divi-dends over time. The chance at getting extra cash is a good thing as you try to preserve your nest egg from the ravages of time and inflation.

Chunk 1119 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But I cannot stress enough that even dividends 
paid by massive companies or even seem-ingly stable businesses are not guaranteed. Dividends are not to be considered a replace-ment for interest you receive through savings vehicles such as certificates of deposits, money market funds or bonds. 
If the financial crisis that began in 2007 taught

investors anything, and it did teach several painful lessons, is was just how fleeting divi-dends could be. As the financial crisis worsened, company after company slashed or downright eliminated their dividend payments. Even companies that had been paying dividends for decades were forced to slice their dividends to preserve precious cash. For some companies, cutting the dividend was the first thing to do as financial pressures mounted.

In fact, dividend payments from stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500 fell by 32% in July 2009 from their level in 2008, says S&P . That brutal decline made July 2009 the worst July for divi-dend payments since 2002. And as of July 2009, S&P estimated investors would get $61.5 billion less in dividend payments than they did in 2008. Talk about a financial hit.

If you’ve ever watched a group of kids playing, you’ll quickly learn some 
slightly unpleasant traits of human nature. The room could be filled with thousands of toys of all kinds. But, almost inevitably, if one child picks up a toy to play with, it’s not long before the others notice and decide they must have that same toy. A chorus of “mine” quickly breaks out. 
That same playground mentality often reaches Wall Street too. There are thou-

sands of stocks available. But, quite often, just a few hundred stocks will get all the attention while the rest will get ignored. It’s not unheard of for just a hand-ful of stocks, for whatever reason, to become must-own stocks or story stocks. 
These are shares of companies that seem to do everything right. Investors buy into the company’s promises and push the stock price to lofty valuations, only for the company to disappoint and the stock to fall back to earth.

Chunk 1135 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
It’s very difficult, if not virtually impossible, to know when a stock is over or 
undervalued until after the fact. Complicating things further, even if you’re able to determine a stock is undervalued, other investors probably will too. And if they do, and buy the stock before you, they will push the price higher, and the stock will no longer be undervalued. 
But don’t let the fact that trying to find undervalued stocks is difficult dis-

courage you completely. If you’re going to try to outsmart other investors and traders, you’ll need to know how to do a DCF analysis. 
Before getting to that, though, it’s helpful to first consider how the value of 
a stock can be measured. There are two main ways to look at what a stock is worth, including the:

Chunk 1137 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Market value: An investment’s market value is what most investors primarily pay attention to. A stock’s market value is the price investors have attached to a company. Market value is measured by multiplying a stock’s price per share by its number of shares outstanding. You can review Chapter 3 to learn more about how market value is calculated. The constant tug of war between buyers and sellers pushes a stock up and down to settle at a price where the demand for the stock equals the supply

Chunk 1138 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
where the demand for the stock equals the supply of share.

Chunk 1139 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
When you sell a stock, remember there’s another investor who has just 
bought it from you. That other investor thinks the stock you’re dumping is selling for a good price. Does this other investor know something you don’t? Before selling a stock, it’s not a bad idea to remind yourself that someone else finds it attractive.

Chunk 1140 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Intrinsic value: A stock’s intrinsic value, sometimes called its fundamental 
value, isn’t based on what other investors think it’s worth as is market value. Instead, a stock’s intrinsic value is based on all the fundamental data you’re been reading about so far in the book, namely earnings, cash 
flow and dividends. A stock’s intrinsic value is based on how much money the company is expected to earn over its lifetime.

The difference between an investment’s market value and intrinsic value is

best understood with an example. Imagine an inventor is auctioning off a machine that spits out a gold bar worth $1,000 every year for 10 years. As you might imagine, some bidders might be so enamored with the machine they might offer hundreds of thousands of dollars for it. Perhaps the bidders think they can tinker with the machine to make it spit out two gold bars a year instead of one. But in its current form, the machine’s intrinsic value is $10,000, not adjusting for inflation, since

Chunk 1143 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
is $10,000, not adjusting for inflation, since that’s the value of its output of 10 gold bars worth $1,000 apiece.

Chunk 1144 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
How minding intrinsic value can help you
One of the best ways to be successful in an auction is knowing what price you’re willing to pay before even entering a bid. If you ever find yourself in a heated bidding war over a Pez dispenser on eBay, for instance, you’d better know how much that dispenser is really worth by consulting a price guide. Not knowing the value of a collectible can be perilous if you wind up losing your head and overpaying for it.

Chunk 1145 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The same caution applies to stocks. You might pick up a newspaper and 
keep reading about how great a company’s goods or services are. You might chat with your barber or cousin about a promising company. All these things might tempt you to be that person bidding up a stock’s price and overpaying. “Buying dollar bills for $1.10 is not good business,” wrote Warren Buffett in his 1999 letter to shareholders.
Knowing a stock’s intrinsic value, though, keeps you honest. If you know how

Chunk 1146 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
to determine how much cash a company is expected to generate over its lifetime, you know roughly what its stock is worth and can bid only when it’s priced right. Going back to the gold-bar machine example, you want to buy the machine when you can get it for less than $10,000. 
 Warren Buffett is famous for paying close attention to a stock’s intrinsic

Getting up to speed for the
discounted cash flow
Now that you know what intrinsic value is, the question is how do you mea-
sure it? There are several methods of calculating intrinsic value, but the DCF analysis is one of the top methods used by fundamental analysts. 
In the next section, I’ll show you how to do a discounted cash flow analysis. 
But first, it’s important to understand some of the most basic parts of how it works, including: 
A company’s cash flow

Chunk 1149 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
A company’s cash flow
Companies brag about their earnings, but it’s cash flow that really matters. Unlike earnings, which are a measure of profits based on accounting rules, a company’s cash flow is the amount of cold hard cash it generates. You can remind yourself of the importance of cash flow in fundamental analysis in Chapter 7. 
But to save you from having to flip back in this book, just know that there are

Chunk 1150 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
many ways to define a company’s cash flow. Still, fundamental analysts often focus on what’s called free cash flow. Generally speaking, a company’s free cash flow is the amount of cash it throws off from its daily business, minus any cash it needs to spend on self-improvement, or capital expenditures. 
 All the information you need to calculate a company’s free cash flow is available 
on the statement of cash flows. The formula for free cash flow looks like this:

Chunk 1151 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Free cash flow = Cash from operations – capital expenditures
Being able to calculate a company’s free cash flow is the first step in building a DCF analysis. The entire analysis is based on the company’s free cash flow. 
Understanding the time value of money
The term discounted cash flow analysis might sound strange. When you think of a discount, you probably think of that sweater that just went on sale at the mall. But in finance, discount means something different.

Chunk 1152 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
A discount in fundamental-analysis-speak is a way to describe the phenom-
enon that a dollar received in the future isn’t worth as much as a dollar received today. If someone offered to give you $100, you wouldn’t want to wait around 100 years for it. You’d want it now.
There are a number of reasons why a future dollar is worth less than a dollar

Chunk 1153 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
now, including inflation and risk. Since prices generally rise every year, a dollar won’t buy as much in the future as it would today, known as its present value. 
17 506455-ch11.indd   18017 506455-ch11.indd   180 9/24/09   10:35:00 PM9/24/09   10:35:00 PM181 Chapter 11: Finding a Right Price for a Stock Using Discounted Cash Flow
Most years, inflation eats into the purchasing power of currency. In addition,

Chunk 1154 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
there’s a risk you won’t actually get the dollar in the future. A dollar bill in your possession now is more valuable than the vague promise you’ll get one in the future. 
 This matter of the present value of a dollar is critical to the DCF analysis. For 
instance, let’s say you correctly forecasted how much cash a company will gen-erate in its lifetime. Here’s the problem: You don’t actually get all that cash now. You need to wait many years to collect cash as it’s generated by the company.

Chunk 1155 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Unless you have a time machine and can collect the future dollars, you’ll 
have to rely on some good old-fashioned fundamental analysis to tell you what those dollars in the future are worth today. Sounds pretty Twilight Zone, I know. But measuring the present value of a company’s future cash flows is exactly what a DCF analysis does. 
There are many ways to measure present value, but we’ll start with the basic 
formula to show you how all this works. Trust me; it looks scarier than it is:

Chunk 1156 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Present value = Future value / (1+interest rate) ^ time
 The ^ is the way to designate an exponent. Must calculators have a key, yx, 
which will allow you to take a number to a power. 
It’s easiest to get your head around this whole present-value concept with a 
simple example. Imagine you win $1 million in the lottery. Now, imagine the state makes you an offer. You can either get the whole $1 million in five years, or the state will pay you $950,000 right now. What’s a better deal?

Chunk 1157 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
At first, you might feel like it’s a no-brainer. Why accept just $950,000? You 
wouldn’t even be able to call yourself a millionaire. 
But guess what? Using the concept of present value, you quickly find out 
you’re actually better off taking the $950,000 now. Let’s say interest rates are 3% and expected to remain there for the next five years. Using the present-value formula, you calculate that $1 million received in five years is only worth $862,608 in present value. Here’s what I mean:

Chunk 1158 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Present value ($862,608) = $1,000,000 / (1 + 0.03) ^ 5
In the example above, the future value of the problem is $1 million. That’s what you’re receiving in the future. 
I’ve only subjected you to the torture of the present-value formula to show 
you how it can be calculated by hand. Most fundamental analysts, though, aren’t so masochistic and tend to use financial calculators or spreadsheets to

Chunk 1159 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
17 506455-ch11.indd   18117 506455-ch11.indd   181 9/24/09   10:35:00 PM9/24/09   10:35:00 PM182 Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
calculate present value. It’s a very good idea, if you plan on doing DCF analyses, 
to invest in either a financial calculator or a copy of Microsoft’s Excel. 
 Using a financial calculator, such as Hewlett-Packard’s HP 12c, the problem

Chunk 1160 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
above is a snap. Simply enter 5, then press the n key for the number of years. Enter 3, then hit the i key, for the interest rate. Lastly, enter 1,000,000 and the FV key for future value. When you press the PV key, you’ll get the answer instantly. 
Microsoft’s Excel spreadsheet software can also handle the problem pretty 
easily. You would just enter a function that looks like this: 
=PV(interest rate, number of periods, number of interim payments, future value)
Or, in this example:

Chunk 1161 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Or, in this example: 
=PV(0.03,5,0,1000000)
Performing a Discounted 
Cash Flow Analysis
Now that you understand what a discounted cash flow analysis is and why it’s 
critical to fundamental analysis, it’s time to do one yourself. To perform a dis-counted cash flow analysis, you’ll need a few pieces of information, including the company’s: 
 ✓ Current free cash flow: This is how much cash the company generated during the most recent year.

Chunk 1162 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Number of shares outstanding: This is the number of shares a company has put into shareholders’ hands. A company’s number of shares out-standing is available from the annual report. 
 ✓ Expected growth rate in the intermediate term: You will need to esti-mate how rapidly a company’s cash flow is likely to grow over the next five to 10 years. You can either estimate this yourself or get it from finan-cial Web sites.

Chunk 1163 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Expected perpetual growth rate: Over time, most companies mature and start to grow at the pace of the economy. Over a company’s very long term, this more moderate growth rate is assumed to continue into the future. 
 ✓ Discount rate: This is how much return investors, in exchange for providing their cash to the company, expect to receive.

 You’re about to start one of the most math-intensive chapters in this entire book.

Chunk 1165 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Calculating a stock’s intrinsic value using the DCF analysis requires several formulas and steps. Don’t get frustrated if it seems confusing at first. Just reread the Chapter and practice, and soon, it’ll make sense. It can also be helpful to build a spreadsheet, so you can see how all the calculations fit together. This chapter will calculate the intrinsic value of a well-known con-sumer products company, Procter & Gamble. 
Starting out with free cash flow

Chunk 1166 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Starting out with free cash flow 
Before you can measure all the cash a company is expected to generate in its lifetime, you need to know how much cash it generated in the just-completed period. This is the base of the DCF analysis. 
Take P&G’s 2008 results, for instance. During fiscal 2008 ended June 30, P&G

Chunk 1167 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
generated cash from operations of $15.8 billion and spent $3.0 billion on capi-tal expenditures. Subtract the $3 billion cap ex from the $15.8 billion in cash from operations and you determine the company had free cash flow of $12.8 billion in 2008. Financial analysts love the ’80s

Chunk 1168 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Ah. The 1980s. You might think of legwarmers and New Wave music when you think of the decade of Flashdance and Duran Duran. But for fundamental analysts, the decade wasn’t all lost. In 1982, Hewlett-Packard introduced the HP 12C financial calculator, which revolution-ized fundamental analysis. Even to this day, in the age of laptops, an HP 12C is almost required equipment for any self-respecting fundamental analyst. You’ve probably seen the calculators, which have a retro look to them, kind of

Chunk 1169 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
which have a retro look to them, kind of resem-bling something used to launch the Apollo spacecraft. The 12C is hard to miss with its industrial style and gold metal band at the top. Lore has it that fundamental analysts snapped up the HP 12C, in part, because it’s used hori-zontally, unlike most calculators that are used vertically, making it look like a miniature com-puter. HP still sells the calculator today, making it the company’s longest-selling calculator. If you’re curious, you can

Chunk 1170 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
calculator. If you’re curious, you can download and read the HP 12C’s owner’s manual, which is actually an excellent primer in business math. It’s avail-able for free at http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c00363319.pdf.

Getting the company’s shares outstanding
A company’s number of shares outstanding tells you how many pieces a

Chunk 1172 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
company’s ownership is cut into. The number of shares outstanding is read-ily available in a company’s annual report, or closely related 10-K, and the quarterly reports, or the related 10-Qs. At the end of fiscal 2008, P&G had 3.03 billion shares outstanding. You can review what data are in the 10-K and 10-Q in Chapter 4. 
Estimating the company’s 
intermediate-term growth
Up to this point, the data you need to do a discounted cash flow analysis

Chunk 1173 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
are based in fact. A company’s free cash flow last year, for instance, is in the financial statements in black and white. The number of shares outstanding is also a matter of fact. 
But in this step, you’ll need to start making some guesses. Clearly, there’s no 
way to know for sure how rapidly a company’s cash flow will grow in the next five years, much less 10. You’ll need to estimate this future growth rate. 
There are two main ways to estimate a company’s future growth, including:

Chunk 1174 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Historical trend analysis: A company’s historical growth rate is a good

Chunk 1175 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
place to start when trying to see how fast it will grow in the future. If the company is in a pretty stable business, looking at its historical growth trends can be a good way to forecast the future. After all, consumers will generally buy P&G’s toilet paper, detergent and soap in the bad times, and they probably won’t stock up during the good times. Using a histori-cal trend analysis, explored in more detail in Chapter 17, you can get an idea of how quickly a company’s cash flow has grown over

Chunk 1176 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
how quickly a company’s cash flow has grown over the years.

Chunk 1177 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Listening to the analysts’ forecasts: The second method of estimating a growth rate is by considering what analysts say. Most stock analysts’ reports will provide an expected long-term growth rate. Many financial Web sites also provide an average of the analysts’ earnings growth fore-casts, which can be a good proxy for guesses at the company’s future cash flow growth. P&G was expected to grow by 10% a year over the next five years, according to MSN Money as of early 2009. I will use 10% for

Chunk 1179 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The difficulty in estimating expected future growth rates is a big reason 
why, as a fundamental analyst, you might stick with companies that sell products that have stable and steady growth. They are much easier to forecast growth for.

Chunk 1180 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Going way out: Forecasting 
long-term growth
Companies are like rock stars. Even the great ones slow down over time. Even 
outstanding companies eventually succumb to the gravitational pull of capi-talism when competitors crowd into their markets and drive down profits and eat into market share. 
It’s unrealistic to expect even a good company to keep growing at a double-

Chunk 1181 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
digit pace forever. Generally, fundamental analysts assume a company’s growth over its lifetime will moderate to the economy’s growth. Over time, that super-long-term-growth rate is about 3%. 
Measuring the discount rate
If you thought estimating a company’s intermediate growth rate was tough, just wait until you try to estimate the discount rate, sometimes called a com-pany’s cost of capital. The discount rate is what you’ll use to measure the present value of the company’s future cash flows.

Chunk 1182 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Measuring a company’s discount rate can be an extremely complex calcula-
tion that could keep a supercomputer busy for a couple of days or weeks. I’m going to assume you don’t really want to get into the gory details. If you do, “Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies” (Wiley) will delight you and your pet supercomputer. 
For our purposes, though, it’s important to get in the ballpark for the dis-
count rate calculation. There are two primary ways to do this, including:

Chunk 1183 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Taking a cue from bond investors
One way to estimate the discount rate is by taking the yield being paid on

Chunk 1184 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
some of the company’s bonds that mature in five years or longer. The yield is the return investors would get if they bought the bond at the current price. The current yield on thousands of companies’ bonds are available for free at brokerage firms’ Web sites. Bond yields are also available on the free corporate bond tracking system, TRACE, which is operated by securities regulator FINRA at cxa.marketwatch.com/finra/BondCenter. Here’s how to get a bond yield from TRACE in four easy steps:

Chunk 1185 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
1. Enter the stock’s ticker symbol in the “Symbol” blank, located under 
the light blue bar that says “Quick Bond Search.”
 2. Choose the Corporate option next to where it says “Bond Type:”.
 3. Select 5 to 10 years in the Maturity space.
 4. Click the Search button.

You’ll see a list of the company’s bonds and their yields, giving you an idea

Chunk 1186 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
of what returns bond investors are demanding. In early 2009, the average on P&G bonds was about 4.5%. 
 Don’t assume that a bond’s yield is equal to the discount rate for a stock. After

Chunk 1187 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
all, you’re taking more risk buying a company’s stock than a bond investor is taking, since you don’t get a guaranteed return. As a result, you must add anywhere between one to three percentage points to arrive at a discount rate. In this example, you might assume the discount rate to be 7%. The riskier the company, the more you’ll want to add to this yield. 
Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
So, are you sorry you started reading this chapter yet? Hang in there.

Chunk 1188 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
You might not like using a bond yield to approximate a discount rate. After 
all, bond buyers are taking much less risk, since they’re guaranteed a return and get first dibs on the company’s assets in case of trouble. 
That’s where the Capital Asset Pricing Model, or CAPM, comes in. This formula
states a company’s discount rate should be relative to the risk taken by inves-tors and what return they could get for taking no risk. The formula looks like this:

Chunk 1189 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
CAPM discount rate = risk free rate + (expected market return – risk free-rate) ×  stock’s beta
That’s a scary-looking formula. But it’s not bad if you break it down into its parts:

Chunk 1190 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Risk-free rate: This is the return you’d get for taking very little risk with your money. Generally, this is the yield on U.S. securities maturing in 10 years. This yield is available on nearly any financial Web site. Yahoo Finance (finance.yahoo.com) lists it on the top left-hand side of the page next to the label, 10 Yr Bond (%). The yield was 2.819% in early 2009.

Chunk 1191 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Expected market return: This is the return investors generally expect from investing in stocks. Generally, investors use the stock market’s long-term return of 10% as a reasonable long-term expectation. 
  If you don’t like using the 10% long-term average, you can consider mea-
suring the expected market return by adding the dividend yield to the earnings yield. If you’d like to find out how to measure dividend yield and earnings yield, that’s covered in Chapter 8.

Chunk 1192 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Stock’s beta: Some stocks are riskier than others. Beta is a statistical tool used to quantify how risky a stock is relative to the market. When a stock’s beta is greater than 1, the stock is considered to be riskier, or more volatile, than the market. When a stock’s beta is less than 1, it’s thought to be less risky.

Chunk 1193 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
You can get stocks’ betas from nearly all financial Web sites. For instance, 
using MSN Money, money.msn.com, enter the stock’s symbol in the blank in the upper left-hand corner of the screen and click the Get Quote button. You’ll see the stock’s beta on the right-hand side of the screen. In early March, P&G had a beta, for instance, of 0.63. 
Still with me? If so, it’s just a matter of doing some plugging and chugging. 
The discount rate for P&G looks like:

The discount rate for P&G looks like: 
0.0730 = 0.02819 + (0.1-0.02819) ×  0.63
If you multiply 0.073 by 100, you can convert it into a percentage: 7.3%. 
 When using the CAPM to calculate a discount rate, you must convert all the 
interest rates into decimals before inserting them into the formula. You can do this by dividing the interest rate by 100. For instance, 10% is 0.1, or 10 divided by 100. 
Putting it all together

Chunk 1195 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Putting it all together
Now that you’ve gathered all the raw data, it’s time to put them into a full-fledged DCM. The primary objective is to estimate a company’s future cash flows and then figure out what those cash flows would be worth today. This section will show you do to do this. 
Forecasting the cash flows for the first five years

Chunk 1196 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
You’ll start by creating a table of what the company’s cash flows will look like in the future. All you need is the company’s free cash flow from the just-completed year and its expected growth rate. 
Going back to the P&G example, start with the company’s 2008 free cash flow of

Chunk 1197 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
$15.8 billion. To estimate what the following year’s free cash flow might be, multi-ply the previous year’s figure by 10%, or simply by 1.1. So, to estimate 2009’s free cash flow, multiply 2008’s ($15.8 billion) by 1.1 to get $17.4 billion. And for year two, just repeat. Multiple the estimated 2009 free cash flow of 17.4 billion by 1.1 to arrive at an estimated 2010 free cash flow of $19.1 billion. Keep repeating this procedure for five years until you get something that looks like Table 11-1.

Chunk 1198 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

Forecasting the cash flows for years five and beyond
You might be wondering how long you have to keep multiplying by 1.1. After

Chunk 1199 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
all, P&G will likely be around a very long time. Luckily, though, yet another formula will bail us out and help us figure out how much the company is expected to earn in perpetuity, known as its residual value. The formula looks 
like this: 
Residual Value = Cash flow in year 5 ×  (1 + long-term growth rate)/
(Discount rate – long-term growth rate)
For P&G, that’s $608.42 billion, as calculated by just plugging the variables into the formula like this: 
= 25.4 ×  (1 + 0.03)/(0.073 – 0.03)

Chunk 1200 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
= 25.4 ×  (1 + 0.03)/(0.073 – 0.03) 
Discounting all the cash flows to current value
At this point, you’ve estimated how much cash the company is expected to generate in its lifetime. There’s just one problem. Those cash flows will be received in the future. And as you discovered above, a cash flow received in the future is worth less than one received now. 
To solve this mind-bending dilemma, you’ll need to discount the future cash

Chunk 1201 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
flows using the discount rate. That’s right. That’s a big reason why this whole tortured exercise is called a discounted cash flow analysis. All you need to do now is determine the present value of all the future cash flows you’ve estimated. Starting with the first cash flow, $17.4 billion, you would use this formula:
Present value = Future value / (1+interest rate) ^ time 
By hand, you would calculate the answer, $16.22 billion, by inserting the num-bers in the present value formula like this:

Chunk 1202 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Present value = $17.4 / (1+0.073) ^ 1 
Had enough of all these formulas and prefer to let your calculator do the work? Using an HP 12C calculator, you would follow these steps: 
 1. Set the number of years. Enter 1 and the n key.
 2. Set the discount rate. Enter 7.3 and the i key.
 3. Enter the future cash flow. Enter 17.4 and the FV key.
 4. Calculate the present value. Press the PV key.
If Excel is more your speed, the following formula will do the trick for you: 
=PV(0.073, 5, 0, 17.4)

Chunk 1203 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
=PV(0.073, 5, 0, 17.4)

Be sure to calculate the present value of all five of the years. And when you’re 
done with that, don’t forget to calculate the present value of the residual value. When you calculate the present value of the residual year, in this exam-ple, it’s considered to be in year five.

Chunk 1204 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
You should get something that looks like what you see in Table 11-2: 
Table 11-2 Present Values of Future Cash Flows ($ billions)
Year 1 2 3 4 5 Residual
Present 
value$16.2 $16.6 $17.0 $17.4 $17.9 $417.8
Finally, you add up all the present values to arrive at an intrinsic value of $502.9 billion. This number can then be compared with the market value to see whether the stock is cheap or expensive based on intrinsic value. 
Comparing intrinsic value to market value

Chunk 1205 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Many investors like to think of stocks in terms of their per-share stock prices. And now that you have the stock’s intrinsic value, you can finish the analy-sis by estimating what its intrinsic value, per share, is. To do this, simply divide the intrinsic value of $502.9 billion by the number of shares outstand-ing, which you figured at the beginning of this section to be 3.03 billion. The answer: P&G’s intrinsic value is $165 a share. You then compare the stock’s intrinsic value to the current

Chunk 1206 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the stock’s intrinsic value to the current stock price, using the rules in Table 11-3:

Table 11-3 Sizing Up Intrinsic Value
If a stock’s intrinsic value is . . . . . . the stock may be . . .
Greater than the current stock price UndervaluedLess than the current stock price Overvalued
At the time this chapter was written, amid the bear market of 2008 and 2009, 
P&G’s stock price was $45.71. Using the discounted cash flow analysis, that would make the stock appear to be very undervalued. 
 Don’t assume that just because a stock looks undervalued using the DCF anal-

Chunk 1208 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

Chunk 1209 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Analysis Work for You
Perhaps your brain shut down as soon as you hit the first formula above. 
Certainly, the discounted cash flow analysis is one of the more math-intensive things you’ll do with fundamental analysis. 
Don’t let the parade of formulas, though, discourage you from using the

Chunk 1210 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
theory of the discounted cash flow analysis. Many people, fearing they’re paying too much for a stock, love how the discounted cash flow model gives a framework to measure a reasonable value for a stock. But the math just scares them away. 
And that’s one reason I recommend beginners to use a variety of Web sites 
that will help them do the analysis for you.
 If you’d like to practice doing another DCF analysis and read through another

Chunk 1211 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

Web sites to help you do a DCF 
without all the math
Given just how much calculation goes into the DCF analysis, it’s not surprising 
you can just let a computer do all the work for you. A couple of sites worth checking out include: 
 ✓ Moneychimp’s Cash Flow Calculator ( www.Moneychimp.com/articles/

Chunk 1212 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
valuation) attempts to turn the DCF analysis into a matter of plug-ging in the data. The site asks for you to enter a company’s earnings. However, the analysis works the same if you enter the company’s free cash flow instead, if you’d prefer. After you fill in the blanks, click the Calculate button, and the site will calculate the intrinsic value.

Chunk 1213 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Valuation Technologies’ Discounted Cash Flow (www.Valtechs.com/r2.shtml) takes more of a tutorial approach. There’s quite of bit of text that coaches you on what to enter, and the site does the calculations for the DCF analysis.

Chunk 1214 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ KJE ComputerSolutions’ Business Valuation tool (www.dinkytown.net/java/BusinessValuation.html) is made with a fundamental analyst in mind. You can enter items from the statement of cash flow, and the site helps you process the data to arrive at the intrinsic value.

Chunk 1215 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Damodaran Online’s spreadsheet templates (Pages.stern.nyu.
edu/~adamodar). If you click on the Spreadsheets option on the left-hand side of the screen, you’ll find a treasure trove of financial spreadsheets. There’s a section on the site, called Focused Valuation Models, which offers a variety of pre-made valuation tools.

Chunk 1216 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ TransparentValue (www.transparentvalue.com) takes a unique approach with the DCF model. Rather than analyzing a company’s cash flow, and indicating what the stock price is worth, Transparent Value tells you how many products a company must sell to justify its current stock price. For instance, you can find out how many iPods Apple must sell to justify its valuation, based on the DCF model.

Chunk 1217 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Newconstructs.com (www.newcontructs.com) provides an extremely powerful DCF tool designed for professionals. The system automatically calculates companies’ cash flow, so you don’t even have to crack open a 10-K. While the system is designed for professionals, individual investors may buy reports the company generates using its methodology. 
Knowing the limitations 
of the DCF analysis
Ever hear the expression, “Garbage in, garbage out?” That’s really the best

Chunk 1218 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
way to describe the DCF analysis. While the analysis gives the impression that you’re measuring a stock’s intrinsic value to the penny, it’s highly based on the few assumptions you’ve made. 
For instance, you can get just about any stock to look cheap if you jack up the 
discount rate. And while the discount rate seems like it’s based in science, that, too, is subject to estimation.

of companies publish and mail out the annual report to shareholders, which are hefty documents full of just about everything fundamental analysts search for. The annual report to shareholders and the closely related official annual report called the 10-K, for many fundamental analysts, are the single most important documents a company provides to investors all year. Think of these annual reports as the company’s printed State of the Union Address, a source of information of where the business

Familiarizing Yourself with 
the Annual Report
Plunk. The annual report to shareholders for the company you own shares of

Chunk 1226 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
has just arrived in your mailbox or in your e-mail. You’ll probably notice scores of colorful photos and pictures of happy executives and employees at the front of the document. But if you flip through pages long enough, you’re sure to hit the meat of the report, which is a pile of financials, legal disclaimers and seem-ingly endless footnotes. You might feel tempted to stuff the document back into the mailbox or delete the e-mail and pretend you never got it.

Chunk 1227 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But while it would seem you need some sort of decoder ring to make any 
sense out of the annual report to shareholders and 10-K, after a little guid-ance you’ll know exactly what to do. And if you’re already experienced at reading annual reports, it’s a good idea to know what kinds of things compa-nies can easily bury in these documents and hope nobody notices. 
First, a word on the difference between 
the annual report and the 10-K

Chunk 1228 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the annual report and the 10-K
The term annual report is somewhat of a misnomer. When investors mention 
the annual report, they are either confusing or grouping together two separate documents that have similar purposes. There’s the annual report to share-holders, which is usually just called the annual report, and the annual report required by regulators, usually referred to by its legal name, the 10-K.
You may notice most fundamental analysts use the terms annual report and

Chunk 1229 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
10-K somewhat interchangeably. And that’s usually okay, since both the annual report to shareholders and 10-K generally contain the same informa-tion; they just look different. 
 When the term annual report is mentioned in this chapter, you can assume I’m 
referring to the 10-K unless I state otherwise. 
Introducing the 10-K

Chunk 1230 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Introducing the 10-K 
The 10-K is the annual statement companies are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These closely monitored documents are required as a result of a company being publicly traded, or having shares of stock trading on a major market exchange. Companies that have more than 500 shareholders may also need to file a 10-K.

Chunk 1231 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

The 10-K is a document giving investors and regulators an update on the

Chunk 1232 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
company’s financial standing each fiscal year. The 10-K isn’t much to look at. The document is almost always printed entirely in black and white, and is very sparse when it comes to graphics and other pretty stuff. The 10-K is the document both regulators and auditors look over to make sure the company is disclosing, or informing, investors of all the material, or important, facts about its business. 
Highlighting the annual report to shareholders

Chunk 1233 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The document known as the annual report to shareholders is essentially the glam version of the 10-K. The annual report to shareholders is usually a slick, highly produced document companies mail out to investors every year to kind of show off a little bit. Many companies make an online version, which features fancy graphics and interactive pages. Generally, the printed version of the annual report to shareholders looks almost like a magazine, with the first few pages covered with photos of

Chunk 1234 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
with the first few pages covered with photos of beaming employees and giddy customers all beside themselves with happiness about using the companies’ products.

Some companies are trying to remove confusion between the annual report to

Chunk 1236 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
shareholders and the 10-K. A growing number of companies are simply using the 10-K as their annual report to shareholders, a move that is also saving companies money. But companies, such as Coca-Cola, appear to be making the annual report to shareholders more of a high-level and highly readable summary for investors. Coke, for instance, calls its annual report to share-holders its annual review.  In addition to pages of beautiful people in many countries drinking soda, Coke’s annual review

If you’ve ever read an annual report to shareholders, you’ll notice there’s

Chunk 1239 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
kind of a Jekyll and Hyde thing going on. The first part of the annual report is colorful and fun. Keep reading, though, and the back half gets pretty serious and no-nonsense. In fact, the back portion of the annual report to sharehold-ers is very often a carbon copy of the 10-K, but printed on nicer paper and in a more hip font. And in an increasingly common trend, many companies are simply putting a colorful promotional folder around the 10-K, called a 10-K

Chunk 1240 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
wrapper, to create a less expensive annual report.
 Some fundamental analysts say the annual report to shareholders is a worth-

Chunk 1241 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
less marketing document. That’s probably a bit of an overstatement, though. Certainly, the 10-K is where you want to spend most of your time as an analyst. But the marketing portion of the annual report may contain some useful back-ground to help you understand a company. Just know that the annual report to shareholders is written to be flattering toward the company and its executives.

Getting your hands on the 10-K
Obtaining a copy of the 10-K annual report is surprisingly simple. The document 
is available in several formats, depending on what you’re most comfortable with, including:

Chunk 1243 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Downloading from the Securities and Exchange Commission: The most direct way to get the 10-K is from the SEC’s IDEA database. This is the official database of corporate filings required by the SEC. Downloading the annual report from IDEA assures you that you’re looking at the same document as the regulators. You can get step-by-step directions on navi-gating IDEA in Chapter 4.

Chunk 1244 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Downloading from the company: Most companies will put an electronic version of their annual report to shareholders on their Web site. You can either view it online or download a PDF file. Many companies will also provide access to the 10-K. 
 ✓ Requesting a paper copy from the company:  If you’re the kind of person

Chunk 1245 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
who likes to take a pencil to paper, you can either call or e-mail most com-panies’ investors relations departments and request a copy of the annual report to shareholder or 10-K, or both. Some brokerage firms will automatically send paper copies of these documents to shareholders. 
Dissecting the main sections 
of the annual report
Most 10-Ks follow a pretty standard list of things to be covered. While 10-Ks

Chunk 1246 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
are usually slightly different, and some may contain different items, usually you’ll find most include the basic items listed below.
Business
Here, the company describes in excruciating detail exactly what it sells, where it sells, and how it makes money. Even if you think you know what a company does, taking a spin through the business section of the 10-K can be eye-opening. For instance, did you know that Coke sells Kildevaeld mineral water in Denmark? Now you do.

Chunk 1247 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The business section also gives you, the fundamental analyst, a high-level 
view of the company’s business model. Coke, for instance, primarily sells beverage concentrate to bottling companies. It’s up to the bottling companies to deal with actually turning the concentrate into drinkable beverages, and get the bottles and cans to the stores.

Chunk 1248 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

damental analysis. For instance, since Coke doesn’t actually bottle many of its beverages, a fundamental analyst might be careful before comparing the com-pany with another beverage company that does its own bottling. The bottling businesses requires large investments in machines and trucks, which tend to be less profitable than selling concentrate. And speaking of competitors, in the 10-K’s business section, companies will usually spell out all the companies they deem to be their rivals. This

Chunk 1250 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the companies they deem to be their rivals. This list of rivals is very helpful for fundamental analysts, since it’s a list of comparables, or other companies to benchmark against each other.

Chunk 1251 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Companies will also state, in the business section, who their key suppliers 
are. Fundamental analysts pay attention to suppliers, checking to make sure they’re sound and able to keep providing materials the company needs. Also, sometimes it can be a better idea to invest in a company’s suppliers than in the company itself. Since the suppliers aren’t as well-known, they might have a lower valuation than the company itself.
Risk factors

Chunk 1252 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Risk factors
Cigarettes contain health warnings as do roller coasters and even some food. The same goes for stocks. Companies must clearly spell out everything that possibly could go wrong. Many of the risks are boilerplate, meaning cut-and-pasted legalese, but sometimes the warnings can be useful in fundamental analysis. 
 Ignoring the risk factors in companies’ 10-Ks can be a big mistake. The risk fac-

tors section in the 10-K filed by Lehman Bros. in January 2008 was stunningly clear. The first risk stated that Lehman stood to suffer if real-estate values were to continue to fall. Lehman also pointed out that being unable to borrow would “impair our liquidity.” The risks were prescient as the housing market fell further and a credit crunch occurred, and Lehman was unable to borrow, causing it to collapse just a few months later in September.

Market for registrant’s common equity
Investors have gotten so used to getting stock information from financial Web sites, they often forget the company itself provides some basic, but some-times useful stock price information. In this section of the 10-K, companies generally provide a chart showing how high and low their stock price got in each quarter of the year, and the value of dividends paid. The company also provides an estimate of how many investors own the stock.

Chunk 1258 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Some companies even tell you how many shares of their own stock they 
issued, or bought back. Information on stock buybacks is extremely valuable, since you can find out whether a company is using its cash on the bet that its stock will rise. The importance of stock buybacks to fundamental analysis will be covered in more detail in Chapter 12. 
 Sometimes, investors need to find out a stock’s price after it no longer trades.

Chunk 1259 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
For instance, a stock you own may have been acquired, or bought, by a rival. 
After a company is bought, you can no longer look up its stock price on most investing Web sites because it no longer actively trades. The Market for Registrant’s Common Equity section of the 10-K can help you get a ballpark estimate of a stock’s value in the past. 
Selected financial data

Chunk 1260 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Selected financial data
Here, you’ll find a handy reference to the company’s most important financial data over the past five years. There may also be some comparative data for the industry. This section of the 10-K is very important for trend analysis, which is covered in more detail in Chapter 17.
Management’s discussion and analysis

Chunk 1261 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Management’s discussion and analysis
Imagine the CEO of a company was put on the witness stand to discuss, with little embellishment, what the company does and what its future looks like. That’s the tone of this critical section of the 10-K, often called the MD&A. The 
18 506455-ch12.indd   19818 506455-ch12.indd   198 9/24/09   10:36:06 PM9/24/09   10:36:06 PM199  Chapter 12: Using the Annual Report (10-K) to See What a Company Is Worth

Chunk 1262 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
company spells out in very plain language what the current standing of the 
business is. 
 Pay careful attention to the wording used in the 10-K. When a business devel-
opment is called “challenging” in the MD&A, that’s a clue to fundamental analysts to dig deeper. 
Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

Chunk 1263 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
There are many risks a company faces that go beyond the business risks listed above. Companies face the risks of rising and falling currencies, and commodity prices, for instance. Some companies sell a great deal of product in foreign countries. That means these companies may be exposed to the risk of falling overseas currencies, which could hurt the bottom line when the profits are brought back home and converted into dollars. 
Financial statements and supplementary data

Chunk 1264 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Here you’ll find the real meat of the 10-K. The company presents all the required financial statements, including the income statement (Chapter 5), balance sheet (Chapter 6) and the statement of cash flows (Chapter 7). At the bottom of the financial statements, you’ll find a further description of each of the line items in what are called the financial footnotes. Some companies may also disclose in these footnotes if they used a slightly unorthodox way of calculating any of the items on the

Chunk 1265 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
way of calculating any of the items on the financial statements.

Chunk 1266 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Some of the most important portions of the 10-K are stuffed into the footnotes. 
These various odds and ends are vitally important to fundamental analysis. Here, the company will disclose all the financial information that is either too specific or unusual to fit neatly into the rows and columns of the financial statements. In either case, you’ll want to pay very close attention to the foot-notes, as I’ll show you later in the chapter. 
Changes in and disagreements with accountants

Chunk 1267 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Changes in and disagreements with accountants
Just as getting into a tiff with your boss or teacher is generally not a great idea, the same goes when it comes to a company and its auditor. If a company and its accounting firm has a, shall I say, difference in opinion over the finan-cials, you’ll find it here. As a fundamental analyst, you want to see this part of the 10-K blank, and it usually is. 
Controls and procedures

Chunk 1268 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Controls and procedures
After the accounting debacles of Enron and Worldcom, regulators leaned on all companies to improve the quality of their financials. One of the key areas of new financial regulation had to do with a company’s financial controls and

Chunk 1269 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
procedures. It wasn’t good enough for a company to have faith that its finan-cial reports were accurate. But companies had to take the extra step to say whether someone could easily cook the books if they wanted to. Companies are required to have safeguards in place to stop fraud from even occurring.

Corporate governance

Chunk 1270 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Corporate governance
This part of the annual report is really just a placeholder for things you can 
find the in the proxy statement. This section pretty much refers you to the proxy statement, covered in Chapter 9, which is where a company lays out how well the company’s board of directors is watching over the company, and how well everyone’s getting paid. 
Exhibits and financial statement schedules

Chunk 1271 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Exhibits and financial statement schedules
Anything that doesn’t quite fit into any of the categories above is stuffed into this part of the 10-K. Interesting items to look for here include the juicy employment contracts given to top executives. 
Executive sign-off
All the top executives sign off on the 10-K. And in a somewhat new develop-ment, in the wake of Enron, a rule called Sarbanes-Oxley requires the CEO and CFO to certify that the books and records are accurate, as far as they know.

Chunk 1272 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Auditor opinion
The company’s accounting firm is required to give the company the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, or not. The auditor’s opinion of the compa-ny’s books will be covered in more detail later in this chapter.What was that again? Restatements

Chunk 1273 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
One of the dirty little secrets of accounting is the fact that companies make mistakes in their financial statements. Mistakes are pretty common, actually. It’s not unheard of for a com-pany, many months or years after reporting revenue and earnings, to tell shareholders the numbers are wrong and need to be changed. When this happens, it’s called a restatement.

Chunk 1274 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Restatements are one of fundamental analysts’ worst enemies. When you analyze a company’s fundamentals, you’re forced to somewhat take the company’s word on the truth of the finan-cial statements. When financials are restated, that throws into question all the work you did analyzing the company. Just see how common restatements are by checking out how many companies issued restatements in the follow-ing years (source: AuditAnalytics.com):

How to Tackle a Massive Annual Report
When slogging through a company’s annual report, you might start think-

Chunk 1276 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
ing War and Peace wasn’t so long after all. Not only are annual reports usu-ally around 200 pages long, they’re stuffed with technical language, tables, and detailed footnotes that will make you wish you were reading about the Bezukhovs and the Bolkonskys instead of revenue and earnings. 
But as a fundamental analyst, reading the 10-K is one of those things you’ll

Chunk 1277 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
quickly master. Don’t worry. You don’t need to be an accountant to get what you need from the annual report. In this section, I’ll step you through things you should be looking for in the annual report. 
Starting from the bottom up: The footnotes

Chunk 1278 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Starting from the bottom up: The footnotes
Reading an annual report is very different than reading a book. With a novel, you probably wouldn’t read the back of the book first, in case you ruin the surprise ending. But fundamental analysts hate surprises. Perhaps that’s why many start reading the annual report near the bottom with the footnotes. 
By reading the footnotes before reading anything else, you can quickly find

Chunk 1279 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
out about all the unusual items going on at the company. It’s usually the unusual items that might have the most sway over your final opinion on a company’s future or health. 
 Some fundamental analysts intentionally do not read any of the commentary

Chunk 1280 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
from the management until they’ve reviewed the footnotes of the annual report. Management’s discussion, in both the MD&A and in the preface of the annual report to shareholders, will be full of positive spin. You don’t want your unbiased opinion toward the company to be tainted until you have a chance to figure out what questions you have. 
When reading the footnotes, you’ll want to pay special attention to areas 
described in the sections that follow.

Chunk 1281 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
described in the sections that follow. 
Assets and liabilities that aren’t on the balance sheet
One of the strangest things about accounting rules is companies are allowed, for various reasons, to keep certain assets or liabilities off the balance sheet. As you can imagine, this is a huge issue for fundamental analysts. The bal-ance sheet is one of the key financial statements fundamental analysts use to assess a company’s debt load and access to cash.

Chunk 1282 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
18 506455-ch12.indd   20118 506455-ch12.indd   201 9/24/09   10:36:07 PM9/24/09   10:36:07 PM202 Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis 
Sometimes, what isn’t on the balance sheet is more important than what is 
on it. Consider American International Group, or AIG. This massive insurance company all but collapsed until the government plowed tens of billions of dollars into the company. How could an insurance company be brought to its knees?

Chunk 1283 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The answer was contained in a footnote buried in the company’s 2008 annual

Chunk 1284 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
report: credit default swaps, or CDS. CDS are extremely complicated financial instruments that are essentially insurance policies to protect investors from bum investments. Just as an insurance policy protects a homeowner from a loss from fire, a CDS would protect an investor, say, if a borrower couldn’t pay back a loan. AIG made quite a bit of money selling CDS contracts to other investors and collecting premiums from them. But fundamental analysts who paid close attention to the footnotes saw

Chunk 1285 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
who paid close attention to the footnotes saw that AIG was exposed to huge liabil-ities that weren’t on the balance sheet.

Chunk 1286 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Fundamental analysts who paid attention to AIG’s footnotes saved themselves 
a bundle. When the 10-K was filed on Feb. 28, 2008, AIG’s stock price was still trading for more than $50 a share. By the end of 2008, once other investors understood the risks of the CDS contracts, the stock cratered to $1.57 a share. 
Understanding pension liabilities

Chunk 1287 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Understanding pension liabilities
One of the biggest landmines faced by many companies is the huge pension benefits they owe to their retirees. During the 1950s, many companies attracted talented workers by promising to pay them big portions of their salaries well into their golden years. Those promises have come back to haunt many companies. 
 The size of the pension obligations are disclosed in companies’ footnotes.

Chunk 1288 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Pension costs can take a big bite out of profit remaining for shareholders. When a company’s pension is underfunded, for instance, it is required to divert some of its profit to fund its pension plan. Not only can big pension shortfalls eat into a company’s profits, they can also cut into how much a company can afford to invest in new products, which may dent future growth. 
It gets even trickier. Companies invest much of their pension funds. That

Chunk 1289 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
means if the stock market takes a big nosedive, as it did in 2008, companies not only may see their business falter but also be forced to pony up money to put into the pension fund to cover the investment losses. For instance, in 2008, pension plans at the largest U.S. companies were nearly 18% short of the funding they need to cover future expenses, says S&P. 
This shortfall of $459 billion is a direct hit on companies’ profitability. During

Chunk 1290 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
2009, for instance, large U.S. companies may need to contribute an estimated $70 billion to the pension plans in 2009, up from just $10 billion in 2008, says consulting firm Mercer. Table 12-1 shows how companies’ pension liabilities change over time. Notice how the shortfall in 2008 got so large, the pension deficit was larger than companies’ total profit.

 Pension expenses can severely curtail companies’ profitability. If companies 
do contribute $70 billion into pension plans in 2009, that would reduce the profitability of the largest U.S. companies by 8%, Mercer estimates. 
Changes to accounting and inventory

Chunk 1293 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Companies have a certain amount of leeway in deciding how to keep their books and records. That flexibility is part of the U.S. accounting system. But as a fundamental analyst, you want to keep a close eye on when companies make a change to their accounting rules. You should always ask yourself why a company might decide to change its accounting treatment. It’s also a good idea to compare a company’s accounting treatment with other companies in the same industry. Watch out when a company uses

Chunk 1294 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the same industry. Watch out when a company uses accounting methods that make its earnings look better.

Chunk 1295 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Be extremely suspicious if you see that a company changes the way that it 
accounts for inventory. First in, first out, or FIFO, allows the company to con-sider the oldest goods in its warehouses to be the ones it sold first. In a period of rising prices, the oldest goods will have been the cheapest, so the compa-ny’s cost of goods sold under FIFO will be lower, and profits higher. 
Under LIFO, or last in, first out, companies consider that the newest inventory

Chunk 1296 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
is sold. When prices are rising, LIFO tends to decrease profits. Be suspicious when a company voluntarily switches from LIFO to FIFO, since that’s a quick and easy way to artificially boost the bottom line. 
Debt repayment timeline
During the credit crunch of 2008, it became clear that some homebuyers and companies simply borrowed too much money. 
18 506455-ch12.indd   20318 506455-ch12.indd   203 9/24/09   10:36:07 PM9/24/09   10:36:07 PM204 Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis

Chunk 1297 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
A key part of fundamental analysis is understanding whether a company has 
borrowed too much. And an important part of assessing this is knowing when a company’s debt matures, or is due. When a company’s debt matures, sud-denly it must either pay off the debt with cash, or refinance, by replacing the debt with a new loan at the higher current interest rates. 
Chapter 6 shows you how to use the balance sheet to find out how much of

Chunk 1298 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
a company’s debt load is due in more than a year, or long-term debt. But the footnotes provide even more detail on when a company must repay its debts. 
If you notice in the footnotes that a big chunk of a company’s long-term debt 
is due in 13 months, and interest rates have risen, that’s a tipoff that the com-pany’s profits going forward might be lower. If a company doesn’t pay off the debt, it may have to replace the older debt with newer debt carrying higher interest rates.

Chunk 1299 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Effects of tax rates
You might assume U.S. companies pay the standard 35% tax rate. But in reality, very few companies pay that much. Here, companies must state what their actual effective tax rate was and why it differed from the standard 35% tax rate. Typically, the effective tax rate might be decreased if a company does a large portion of its business in countries with lower tax rates.
It’s critical when sizing up a company’s earnings to compare the tax rate the

Chunk 1300 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
company told investors it would use to the one it actually used to measure its profit. It’s possible for companies to artificially boost their earnings by using a lower tax rate than investors are expecting. Fundamental analysts, too, should pay attention if the result a company’s tax rate is lower is due to a temporary reason, such as a short-term tax incentive to open a plant in a certain country. If the tax rate rises in the future, the company’s profitability might take a hit.

Chunk 1301 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
See what management has to say for itself
The MD&A is one of the most clearly written portions of the 10-K. It’s where management spells out, in English, all the important factors facing the com-pany and summarizes all the key elements investors should be aware of. 
 For beginning fundamental analysts, the MD&A is a good place to start read-

Chunk 1302 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
ing the 10-K. Management will step through many of the portions of its busi-ness that are of most interest to fundamental analysts. A few of the things you should be looking for in the MD&A include the:

Forward-looking information
If there’s one knock against financial statements, it’s that they are historical

Chunk 1303 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
documents. The income statement and balance sheet, for instance, tell you what the company did, not what it’s going to do. And as an investor, you’re more concerned about a company’s future than its past. Stock prices tend to rise when a company does better in the future than people expect. Look for any indication from the company about how it expects to perform in the following year.

Chunk 1304 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Don’t expect to see the words, “This is what our business will do next year” in big, bold letters. Management signals this kind of thing more subtly. 
An examination of the real risks
There’s an entire discussion of the risks a company faces inside its MD&A. Many investors assume this is just a duplication of the dedicated risk section in the 10-K. But that’s not always the case. 
In the dedicated risks section, the company spells out every single possible

Chunk 1305 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
thing it could imagine going wrong. Some might even say the CEO could get hit by lightning. (I’m kidding about that, but some companies go almost that far). Many of the risks are pretty generic and probably cut-and-pasted from other places. 
But in the risks section of the MD&A, management highlights a few of the 
risks and provides more detail on why they’re so scary. These risks, I’ve found, tend to be more of the high-level things that might keep a forward-thinking CEO up at night.

Chunk 1306 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Don’t get tripped up over whether you agree the risks highlighted in the

Chunk 1307 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
MD&A are really the biggest concerns. What’s important is that management thinks these risks are significant. Knowing what keeps the CEO up at night gives you a look into the decision-making of a company. For instance, the risks of obesity and changing tastes go a long way in explaining why Coke paid about $4.1 billion to buy rival Glaceau in 2007. The company was a leading competitor in less sugary drinks, such as Vitaminwater, perceived by some consumers to be healthier than soft drinks.

Chunk 1308 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Comparing a company’s promises with reality
One of the top secrets of many fundamental analysts is to always have last year’s annual report handy when reading this year’s. By comparing the two reports side-by-side, a fundamental analyst might pick up some interesting information about how well a company executes on its promises.

Chunk 1310 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the glossy annual report to shareholders, a company might say that it’s invest-ing big-time in its future. Fundamental analysts, though, have long memories and the ability to check the facts. When a company, for instance, claims in 2007 it’s going to invest in its future, you can find out what really happened by reading the 2008 10-K. Simply look up the company’s research & development spending and see how its compares with 2007 levels.

Chunk 1311 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Johnson & Johnson is a good example. In the CEO letter at the front of its 
2007 annual report to shareholders, the health care company stated “We con-tinue to invest aggressively in research and development.” But interestingly, in 2008, J&J actually reduced its research expense by 1.3% to $7.6 billion. Certainly, $7.6 billion is a huge amount of R&D spending. But the fact R&D spending fell reflects a slightly different reality than indicated in the letter to shareholders.

Since companies seemingly get sued all the time, it’s easy to get jaded about lawsuits. A vast majority of legal claims get dismissed with little cost to the company, other than the time of the legal staff.

Secondly, water quality and quan-tity. The company points out water is

Paying close attention to amended 10-Ks

Chunk 1318 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
You might assume the 10-K is practically chisel onto stone and preserved for the ages. But many fundamental analysts are surprised to find out that compa-nies periodically modify numbers that appear in the 10-K and other financial documents for that matter. This is very important for you to remember, since it’s possible, that data on an old 10-K is outdated and has since been revised. You must monitor such changes since they can greatly affect your opinion on a company and its stock.

Chunk 1319 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Revisions and restatements are more common than you might think, as you 
read above. And even large companies have been known to go back and change numbers in the 10-K either to fix errors or update numbers with more accurate data that became evident after the 10-K was filed. 
General Electric, for instance, made a number of modifications to its past

When you see a company making changes to financial data that appeared in

Chunk 1321 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the 10-K, you need to pay close attention. As a fundamental analyst you want to be sure you understand why the changes were made, how significant the changes are and whether the modifications indicate any more serious issues at the company. Most importantly, you want to get an idea of whether or not the company may have padded financial results in order to make itself look good and keep its stock price moving higher.

Examining What the Auditor’s 
Opinion Means For Investors
Investing takes a bit of faith. After all, you’re not permitted to stroll into the

Chunk 1324 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
headquarters of a company and look over its financial books and records, even if you’ve invested in the company. The role of oversight is left to the board of directors, as discussed in Chapter 9. But the other key watchdog for you, as an investor, is the auditor. This auditing firm’s job is to look over the company’s 10-K and ensure the books accurately represent the financial condition of a company.

Chunk 1325 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
While the auditing firm is your watchdog inside the company, keep in mind there is a potential for conflict, too. The auditing firms are paid by the compa-nies, as discussed in Chapter 9, so there’s a risk an auditing firm will not want to upset a big client. That’s why if you see any red flag raised by an audit firm, that’s a giant warning and should not be ignored. 
Paying attention to tiffs between 
a company and its auditors

Chunk 1326 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
a company and its auditors
When a company and its auditors disagree in large degree, the squabble 
must be disclosed in the Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure section. Generally, you really don’t like to see a company getting into a fight with its auditor. For an auditor to dis-agree to the point of putting the dirty laundry into a public filing, it must be a pretty big deal.

Chunk 1327 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Keep a watchful eye if a company abruptly announces it’s replacing its auditor. 
Some companies, which disagree with their auditor, go auditor shopping and 
try to find an accounting firm that’s willing to sign off on the books. Replacing an auditor before the 10-K is put out helps a company get a clean audit opinion, 
as described below. Companies are required to file a Form 8-K stating they’ve 
replaced the auditor and whether or not there was a disagreement at the time.

Chunk 1328 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Understanding the importance 
of financial controls
Both the board of directors and the auditing firm are required to assess the

Reading the audit opinion
The Enron debacle put a new fear into the hearts of accountants everywhere. The alleged mistakes and omissions made by Arthur Andersen in the audits of those giant companies ultimately took the accounting firm down with it.

Chunk 1331 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Ever since the fall of Arthur Andersen, auditing firms have been even more 
vigilant before signing off on a company’s financial statements. And that sign-off, called the audit opinion and found in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm section of the 10-K, is critical for fundamental analysis. 
In this section, the auditing firm will say it gives its blessing to the books,

Chunk 1332 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
usually using wording like “fairly represent the financial position” of the com-pany. Don’t just stop reading there, though. The auditing firm may point to some accounting changes made by the company it thinks investors should be aware of.

 analysts and investors

▶ Uncovering what happens at annual shareholder meetings

Chunk 1335 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
▶ Parsing through news about individual companies and stocks in media reports
Unless you belong to an exclusive country club, are in a Rolls Royce collectors’ club, or jet out to Davos for the World Economic Forum 
every year, you probably aren’t on a first-name basis with the CEOs of the companies you invest in. In fact, you might never have heard the CEOs’ voices, even though you’re entrusting them with your money.

Chunk 1336 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
With very few exceptions, most individual investors won’t get a chance to sit 
down face-to-face with a company’s CEO to discuss the future of the business. The relative unavailability of management to investors is one reason why a vast majority of fundamental analysis is based on closely examining a com-pany’s written financial reports and regulatory filings. 
There are times, though, when members of a company’s management team

Chunk 1337 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
speak to investors. The most substantive meeting top-level executives have with investors is typically during analyst conference calls at the end of each quarter. These meetings, usually available to all investors on a limited basis, can contain critical pieces of information fundamental analysts need to be aware of. There’s also the shareholders’ meeting, an annual gathering of a com-pany’s executives and investors. These meetings are mostly marketing events, but can be worthwhile for

In this chapter, you’ll find out how to extend your fundamental analysis 
beyond the financial statements to include monitoring conference calls, shareholders’ meetings, and media appearances. 
Using Analyst Conference Calls as a 
Source of Fundamental Information
Every quarter, investors eagerly anticipate when companies they’re interested

Chunk 1340 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
in will report their financial results. As soon as the results are available, fun-damental analysts start poring through the quarterly earnings press release, 
as discussed in Chapter 4, to get an idea of how the company did during the most recent three months. 
And while the earnings press release is pretty complete and usually provides

Chunk 1341 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the income statement, balance sheet, and sometimes the statement of cash flows, fundamental analysts still may have plenty of questions. Some analysts might wonder, for instance, why certain costs rose but can’t find a reason for the increase in the earnings press release. Other fundamental analysts might notice a surprisingly large decline in cash. 
That’s where the analyst conference call comes in. Usually, shortly after the

Chunk 1342 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
earnings press release is disseminated, the company sets up a telephone call for Wall Street analysts, who cover the stock, to call in and listen to a discussion about how the quarter went. 
 While most companies’ analyst conference calls are designed for Wall Street 
analysts, that doesn’t mean you should ignore them. I’ll show you, later in this chapter, how you can listen into analyst conference calls and even access transcripts when they’re over.
Understanding the purpose of

Chunk 1343 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Understanding the purpose of 
analyst conference calls 
Analyst conference calls aren’t a chance for the CEO to trade recipes and golf 
stories with Wall Street analysts. While some of these calls sometimes seem oddly chummy, they are supposed to serve several primary purposes including: 
 ✓ Discuss and summarize the company’s performance during the quarter.  
Typically the CEO and chief financial officer will read key parts of the earnings press release and point out items of note.

Chunk 1344 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
19 506455-ch13.indd   21219 506455-ch13.indd   212 9/24/09   10:36:44 PM9/24/09   10:36:44 PM213  Chapter 13: Analyzing a Company’s Public Comments and Statements
 ✓ Field questions from Wall Street analysts. All the analysts who cover 
the company are usually permitted to ask questions about the quarter’s results. Many of the analysts also try to extract more forward-looking 
information from the CEO, to get an idea of what the next quarter’s results might look like.

Chunk 1345 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Some companies are trying to give regular investors greater ability to 
ask questions during the analyst conference calls. Morningstar, a market research firm, for instance, allows any investor to e-mail questions to management. The questions are then collected and answered by the management team each month. It’s a good idea to see if a company you’re analyzing will allow you to pose questions.

Chunk 1346 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Provide future guidance. One of the most widely watched aspects of the analyst conference call is whether the company will indicate what it expects to happen in the immediate future. This tip-off to what the company thinks is likely for future financial results is called guidance. 
The dimming guiding light of guidance

Chunk 1347 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The dimming guiding light of guidance
Some investors are initially surprised to hear some companies provide earn-ings guidance. It might seem somewhat strange to think CEOs would be will-ing to make promises to investors about the future, when the future is far from certain. And you might think that, if a CEO says the next quarter will be strong, that you can quickly make a profit by jumping into the stock. 
But guidance isn’t as mysterious as it might seem. For one thing, many com-

Chunk 1348 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
panies have a pretty good idea of what their book of business, or expected deals with customers, will look like months in advance. And that’s why when CEOs give guidance, they might not be taking as much of a leap as you’d think. Some CEOs, too, might give guidance they think will be easy to beat. That way, even if the quarter was just as expected, investors might view the financial results as better-than-expected and buy the stock.

Chunk 1349 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Just because a company issues positive earnings guidance and says the future 
is bright doesn’t mean investors have a license to cash in. Many times, by boosting investors’ expectations, if the company either misses the guidance or sometimes doesn’t top even the lofty expectations, the stock price can suffer. 
Some companies, seeing the often perverse way some investors use earn-

If a company suddenly stops giving earnings guidance, there’s reason to 
pay attention. Generally, investors assume companies stop giving earnings

Unique things to look for in 
analyst conference calls
During a conference call, you’ll want to make sure the management team

Chunk 1357 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Lack of availability: While nearly all companies conduct an analyst conference call, they are not required to do so by regulators. Regulators only require the timely filing of regulatory documents, including the financial statement. It’s up to the company to decide whether or not to hold an analyst conference call.
   However, when a company doesn’t provide a conference call with ana-

✓ Completeness of answers: If you start noticing the management team is constantly deflecting questions, refusing to answer queries or provid-ing very canned answers, your fundamental analysis radar should start flashing.

Companies will often conduct analyst conference calls before the stock market opens at 9:30 a.m. Eastern or after it closes at 4 p.m. Eastern. This is done intentionally to give companies a chance to fully explain their results before investors rush to conclusions and either buy or sell the stock.

And that’s one reason why fundamental ana-lysts should make it their business to monitor media reports, as described below, since there can be nuggets in the press you might not get elsewhere.

so they might be able to put numbers into context using data you might 
not have. 
  Media reports, too, might make it easier for you to quickly assess 
whether a company’s quarter was considered to be better or worse then expected. Reporters who follow a company generally know ahead of time what analysts were forecasting for the company.

Chunk 1386 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Deeper understanding of companies and the people who run them:  
Some executives, hoping to get their messages out, might sit down with a reporter and more clearly spell out their companies’ objectives or goals. Executive profiles might also give you more of an insight into the personalities of the people running the company you’ve invested in. 
  Some publications routinely provide profiles of company executives. It’s

Chunk 1387 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
important to recognize when these profiles are just CEO adulation, and when they’re analysis.

Chunk 1388 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Industry insight: Just reading the financial statements doesn’t really give you the buzz about a company or its products. Financial media, dedicated to specific industries, might give you a good early indication on how a company’s new product, for instance, might be perceived. Some large companies, too, might have a Web site that’s dedicated just to them. Reading these, and comments from other readers, might give you things to look for when analyzing a company.

Chunk 1389 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Technology media can be especially helpful to fundamental analysts looking 
at tech companies. For instance, following the video-game industry’s main conference in 2005, media were gushing over Nintendo’s Wii game console. At the time, the concept of a game console operated with a motion-sensitive controller seemed odd. But the video-game press glowed over the device, and ultimately the console proved to be a big success and helped push Nintendo’s profits higher. 
What fundamental analysts

Chunk 1390 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
What fundamental analysts 
look for in the media
Given the barrage of information available to fundamental analysts, it might be 
overwhelming to think that you need to read every financial Web site, news-paper and magazine in addition to studying a company’s regulatory filings. 
But savvy fundamental analysts know how to put the media to work for them. 
Rather than reading everything, much of which is duplicative, fundamental analysts use the media to zero in on developments such as:

Chunk 1391 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ New products: One of the most difficult factors for fundamental analysts to deal with is a company’s new products. With little financial track record to guide them, fundamental analysts may find it tough to figure 
19 506455-ch13.indd   21819 506455-ch13.indd   218 9/24/09   10:36:45 PM9/24/09   10:36:45 PM219  Chapter 13: Analyzing a Company’s Public Comments and Statements
out which new products are potential blockbusters and which ones are

Chunk 1392 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
money-sucking duds. Media reports can help by offering comments from industry experts who can put the new products into perspective.

Chunk 1393 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Bad news: One thing that amazes me as a financial reporter is just how deft company executives are at spinning bad news. I’ve interviewed executives of companies at death’s door, and the CEOs try to tell you how everything is fine. Good financial journalism, though, will help you look past the corporate spin and get a good grip on when a company’s woes are alarming.

Chunk 1394 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Availability (or over-availability): Ever notice some companies’ CEOs are constantly in the press while others’ never are? As a fundamental analyst, it’s important to monitor this kind of thing even through there’s no way to qualify it. When you notice CEOs seem to be on TV a couple times a week, you really need to wonder why they feel so inclined to be constantly telling their story. But at the same time, you might wonder if an executive is being overly secretive, too.

Chunk 1395 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
When to be skeptical of executives’ 
claims in the media
Just because an executive makes a claim in the media, don’t assume it’s true. 
Sometimes the media outlet, or reporter, isn’t qualified or prepared to call out or correct an executive who makes a false or exaggerated statement. 
This point was made clear when the CEO of Amplidyne, Devendar Bains,

Chunk 1396 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
made a series of claims about the Internet company’s products on finan-cial TV in 1999. Bains said the company tested a new product to speed up Internet transmission over a 50-mile distance and the company was ready to sell it, a complaint from the SEC says. But the SEC alleges Amplidyne never field-tested the products and the company, in fact, didn’t even have finished products ready to sell. 
 Fundamental analysts should be especially cautious of companies that seem

Chunk 1397 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
to be in the business of issuing press releases. Some companies, especially those that trade on the largely unregulated Pink Sheets market, attempt to stoke interest in their stocks by constantly putting out promising-sounding press releases. If trading is light in the stock, meaning there aren’t many buyers and sellers, a stock’s price can be fairly easily manipulated by seemingly positive press releases.

Knowing When to Pay Attention 
at Shareholders’ Meetings

four members: Bono, The Edge, Larry Mullen Jr., and Adam Clayton. Or perhaps you’ve seen endless photos of Germany’s Neuschwanstein Castle, but there’s nothing quite like seeing the towering spires in person. 
For some fundamental analysts, the annual shareholder meeting is the face-
to-face chance to interact with a company’s management team. 
 Getting tickets to a U2 concert may practically require you to hock your wife’s

What to expect during a company’s 
annual meeting
The annual shareholder meeting is kind of like a corporate version of show-

Chunk 1402 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
and-tell. Nearly all these meetings are held in large conference halls or audi-toriums, and not on the companies’ premises. The companies often use these meetings as a chance to showcase all the products they offer. You can find out when and where a company’s shareholder meeting is held usually in the proxy statement, which is discussed at length in Chapter 9.
 While companies generally don’t conduct their annual meetings at their head-

Chunk 1403 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
quarters, you might be a little concerned if a company seems to go out of its way to hold it somewhere it knows might be difficult to visit. 
Annual shareholder meetings often follow a script like this: 
 ✓ Flashy introduction: Many meetings kick off with a flashy slideshow or 
video presentation showcasing just how cool the company’s products are. There’s very little value to these shamelessly promotional presentations.

Chunk 1404 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

 ✓ Presentations from company management: The CEO and perhaps chief 
financial officer and chief operation officer might give a speech outlining their goals for the company in the year ahead. 
  There’s rarely any new information released at the annual shareholder

Chunk 1405 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
meetings. Anything of material interest has already been disclosed in the proxy statement or the 10-K, which is explored in Chapter 12.

Chunk 1406 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Shareholder question-and-answer period: Some companies allow share-holders to stand up and ask the management team questions. Other companies require questions to be submitted ahead of time and will only be posed to management if they are selected. In some cases, inves-tors who have put proposals for a vote on the proxy are permitted to give a presentation of their views. 
Putting the “Fun” in fundamental analysis

Chunk 1407 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Putting the “Fun” in fundamental analysis
Typically lacking substantive information, the annual shareholders meet-ings are generally designed to make investors get a warm fuzzy feeling about being investors. Generally speaking, that’s the kind of feeling you, as a funda-mental analyst, don’t want to have.

Chunk 1408 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
It’s dangerous to get so attached to a stock that you lose your objectivity. Falling in love with a stock, as it’s called, may cause you to stop asking the tough questions when owning a stock. Remember, stocks don’t love you back. 
A few companies are especially famous for their annual shareholder meetings.

Chunk 1409 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Shareholder meetings of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway are especially legendary. Scores of Berkshire investors descend on Omaha (the Qwest Center was the location of the 2009 meeting) to try to get close to the Oracle of Omaha. 
The Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting is such a big deal it’s almost like a

There are also plenty of opportunities to buy and try products sold by Berkshire companies ranging from See’s Candies to Borsheim’s Fine Jewelry. Buffett usually refers to the event as the “Woodstock for Capitalists.” 
 Don’t feel like you need to attend an annual shareholders’ meeting or you’ll

Fundamental analysts, almost by nature, approach investing as a solitary

And that’s where it can be worth-while to look into the fundamental research done by others.

Similarly it can be helpful to find out which other investors are buying a stock you’re interested in and what they’re saying about it.

Reading Analysts’ Reports for 
Fundamental Analysis Clues

Chunk 1416 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Fundamental Analysis Clues
It might seem strange to suggest you take a look at research reports from 
others in a book about doing fundamental research on your own. After all, perhaps you’re interested in learning how to analyze stocks because you’ve gotten bad investing advice from a broker or analyst in the past. 
You’re wise to be skeptical of research coming from anyone else, including

Chunk 1417 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Wall Street brokerage firms. Often times analysts get paid by companies, either directly or indirectly, to generate research to convince others to buy a stock. In 2003, for instance, the nation’s biggest brokerage firms were ordered to pay $1.4 billion to settle charges that they misled investors with biased research. 
With all that said, research from professional analysts can provide you with

Chunk 1418 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
very helpful information to accompany your own fundamental analysis. You just need to know how to read analyst research reports and how to extract genuinely helpful information from them. And that’s precisely what I’ll show you how to do in this chapter. 
Why reading analysts’ reports 
can be worth your time
Sadly, most investors fixate on the wrong thing when reading analyst reports.

Chunk 1419 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Nearly all the time, investors will look at the top of an analyst report for the stock rating and see if the stock is deemed buy, hold, or sell. The simplicity of those ratings makes them irresistible, and investors may feel tempted to follow them. Unfortunately, many investors get themselves into trouble and risk losing a large sum of money when they blindly follow the ratings they read in analyst reports. 
 The stock ratings from analysts are infamously poor. During 2008, for instance,

Chunk 1420 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
just 49% of the stocks with buy ratings from the top five analysts rose, according to analyst tracking service Investars.com. That means even if you buy a stock recommended by a top analyst, you still have a coin-flip chance of losing money. 
Despite their problems, though, analyst research reports can contain some 
solid information. Some of the reasons why you might want to take a look at analyst reports include:

Chunk 1421 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ A way to double-check your own analysis: Most of the analysts who write these reports are highly trained financial professionals who know how to do everything from discounted cash flow, or DCF, analysis (as covered in Chapter 11) to) to advanced valuation measurement. You 
20 506455-ch14.indd   22420 506455-ch14.indd   224 9/25/09   12:21:46 AM9/25/09   12:21:46 AM225  Chapter 14: Gleaning from the Fundamental Analysis Done by Others

Chunk 1422 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
might want to compare the results of your DCF model with those created 
by professional analysts to see if they’re in the same ballpark. 
 ✓ Industry insight: Many times the analysts assigned to cover an industry either have studied that field for a long time or even worked at a com-pany in the business. This in-depth industry experience can help you improve your analysis of an industry, as discussed in Chapter 16.

Chunk 1423 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Dissenting point of view: If you’re convinced a stock is a screaming buy, it might make sense to seek out analyst reports that are less bullish on that stock. Perhaps the bearish analyst will point out things you didn’t notice in your own analysis. 
 Analysts’ reports are infamously overly bullish. For a variety of reasons,

Chunk 1424 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
research reports from Wall Street brokerage firms tend to rarely slap a dreaded sell rating on a stock, as you can see in Table 14-1. The table, though, shows how analysts have been getting more skeptical in recent years. Even so, the fact so few companies get a sell rating underscores why you need to remember that when a Wall Street firm rates a stock a hold, that’s actually a fairly negative recommendation you might consider to be a sell.

Understanding the types of firms 
that put out stock research
Not all analyst research reports are created equal. While the term analyst

Chunk 1426 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
report is a catch-all used to describe nearly all investment research generated by professional analysts, there are many flavors of research to be aware of.

The first way you should differentiate research in your mind is based on the

Chunk 1427 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
source. Knowing where research is coming from, and how the person or firm generating the report gets paid, is vital to understanding what the potential biases and shortfalls in the research might be. Typically, research reports are put into one of two categories based on their source, including: 
Broker research

Chunk 1428 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Broker research
Research generated by the analysts at large brokerage firms, such as Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and UBS, is usually what investors think of first when its comes to analyst research. These large firms hire armies of analysts who have a coverage universe, or set group of stocks, to constantly monitor.
 Never overlook the potential conflict of interest when it comes to broker

Chunk 1429 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
research. Many of the same Wall Street firms that put out research on com-panies also have large investment banking arms. The investment banking portions of these Wall Street firms get lucrative fees performing services for companies, such as selling stock or bonds to investors. If a brokerage firm were to put out negative research on a company, it could risk upsetting man-agement and jeopardize the future investment banking business.

Chunk 1430 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Luckily, if you pay attention you can spot signs of potential conflict in broker 
research. At the bottom of broker research reports, you’ll find a number of key disclosures. In one section, the brokerage firm must tell you whether or not the firm receives investment banking business from the company covered in the report. Analysts, too, must tell you if they personally own shares of the Giving analyst reports a bad rap

Chunk 1431 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
It’s long been understood by those familiar with investing that the ratings given to stocks by Wall Street analysts are to be ignored at best due to the conflict mentioned above. 
But the potential for significant conflicts of

Chunk 1432 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
interest became very clear in the early 2000s, when 10 investment banks agreed to a sweep-ing $1.4 billion settlement with regulators for allegedly putting out misleading research reports to investors. Some individual analysts were also penalized. Henry Blodget, a former managing director at Merrill Lynch who made a name for himself publishing glowing reports on Internet companies, was barred from the industry and hit with a $4 million monetary punishment by the Securities and Exchange

Chunk 1433 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
punishment by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2003. The SEC concluded that these firms and analysts routinely published reports that encouraged investors to buy stocks, giving them “buy” or “strong buy” recommen-dations, despite knowing the companies being recommended had fundamentals that were not sound. Investors who trusted the research and followed the recommendations, in many cases, lost large amounts of money. These charges are more reason why you want to know how to do your own

Chunk 1434 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
reason why you want to know how to do your own fundamental research, rather than rely on the work of others.

company’s stock. And the company must disclose what percentage of all its 
ratings are buy, hold, or sell. Clearly, if a company only gives out buy ratings, you know to take a double dose of salt when reading that firm’s reports. 
Independent research

Chunk 1436 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Independent research
Wall Street firms aren’t the only firms that provide research on stocks. Analysts not connected with a big Wall Street firm are typically grouped into the category called independent research. 
By definition, independent research is considered to be analysis that comes 
from a firm that doesn’t have an investment banking unit. As you read above, the co-existence of research and investment banking has been problematic at times in the past.

Chunk 1437 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Independent research often comes from boutique research firms, which may 
be operated by one analyst or a team of analysts who may have specific expe-
rience, such as a particular industry or type of fundamental analysis. Other independent research comes from quantitative research firms, which create 
automated computer programs to study different stocks using a series of tests. 
But not all independent research comes from small research firms. In fact,

Chunk 1438 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
one of the largest providers of independent research is Standard & Poor’s, an investment research company that provides data and information on stocks, bonds and other investments. S&P’s research is considered to be indepen-dent because the company does not do investment banking. 
 But just because research comes from an independent research firm, don’t

Chunk 1439 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
assume it’s better than the research from a brokerage firm. In fact, after the settlement with Wall Street firms, the quality of some brokerage firm’s research improved markedly. Similarly, some of the research from indepen-dent firms has been way off the mark. You should judge whether or not to listen to analysts’ research based on how good the research has been in the past, not by whether it is independent or not. 
Keying into the main types 
of analyst research

Chunk 1440 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Keying into the main types 
of analyst research
Just as there are many types of books, there are many types of analyst 
research reports. As a fundamental analyst, there are two main types of reports you need to concern yourself primarily with, including:

Chunk 1441 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Idea reports: Idea reports are usually lengthy pieces of research an analyst publishes to lay out everything investors need to know about the company, industry and the stock. These reports are often released when an analyst initiates coverage of a stock, or begins to regularly 
20 506455-ch14.indd   22720 506455-ch14.indd   227 9/25/09   12:21:47 AM9/25/09   12:21:47 AM228 Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis

Chunk 1442 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
follow a company. Some analysts often publish idea reports every year, 
where they take a comprehensive look at the just-completed year for the company and forecast what might happen next year. These idea reports are usually chock full of industry statistics, which might come in handy when you dig into how to do industry analysis in Chapter 16. 
  Idea reports can be excellent ways for fundamental analysts to get up to 
speed on a company or industry they hadn’t been aware of before.

Chunk 1443 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Maintenance reports: If idea reports are long and comprehensive, main-tenance reports are just the opposite. Analysts usually dash out quick maintenance reports following major events at a company, such as the release of earnings or the announcement of a significant new product. 
  Maintenance reports are kind of like an episode of a soap opera: Unless

Chunk 1444 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
you’ve been following along (and reading earlier reports) you might not be able to follow what’s going on in a just-released maintenance report. It can be a good idea to review an analyst’s idea report on a company along with the maintenance report. 
How to read between the lines 
of an analyst report
After you determine whether or not a research report is an idea or main-

Some of the key pieces of data you should be on the lookout for in an analyst 
report include:

Chunk 1446 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
report include: 
 ✓ Savvy comparisons of a company to its peers: Analysts most frequently will be assigned to cover an entire industry, including both the large stal-warts in the business and the small up-and-comers. Sometimes analysts are able to pinpoint a company’s strengths and weaknesses that aren’t readily apparent from studying the financial statements.

Chunk 1447 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Deep analysis of demand for a company’s products: The better ana-lysts perform what are called channel checks. In a channel check, an ana-lyst will call up a company’s customers and suppliers to see how well a particular product is flowing through the distribution channel. Analysts might find out, for instance, that retailers are slashing prices on a com-pany’s products just to clear them off the shelves. That’s not a good sign. On the contrary, a supplier might say a company is ordering a

✓ Exploration of a stock’s valuation: Understanding how to measure whether a stock is cheap or expensive is one of the top things investors try to do. There are many ways to attempt measuring a stock’s valua-tion, including looking at price-to-earnings ratios (Chapter 8) and per-forming the discounted cash flow analysis (Chapter 11). Both of these analyses, though, are subject to numerous assumptions and educated guesswork.

Chunk 1452 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Sometimes it can be helpful for you, then, to examine the valuation 
assumptions and results determined by professional analysts. Even if the results don’t agree with your findings, you can compare what they measured to what you measured, see why there’s a difference and adjust your model if needed. 
 If you’re looking for help with the discounted cash flow model, stock reports

Chunk 1453 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
from Standard & Poor’s can be useful. A vast majority of the stock reports from S&P, which can be obtained using the directions I’ll give you below, provide the stock’s discount rate and terminal growth rate. The discount rate is the rate of return investors demand in exchange for putting their money at risk by giving it to the company. And the terminal growth rate is how much the company’s earnings and cash flow are expected to grow in the very long term. Both the discount rate and terminal

primary ways to get analysts reports, including: 
 ✓ Your brokerage firm: If you’re a client of the big Wall Street firms, one of the perks you receive is access to the firm’s analysts’ reports. You might be able to access the reports yourself, or you may be able to ask your individual broker for a copy. 
  What if you’re with a low-cost online discount broker? You’re still in luck.

Chunk 1460 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
A vast majority of the online brokerage firms provide you with research from both the Wall Street firms and from independent research firms. Charles Schwab, for instance, provides access to S&P research reports, as well as access to its own quantitative research model called Schwab Equity Ratings.

Chunk 1461 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Directly from research providers: Most boutique research firms and even the larger independent research providers will sell their research to you. You can buy S&P’s stock research reports, for about $35, from this Web site: www.sandp.ecnext.com/coms2/page_industry2.

Chunk 1462 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Research resellers: A number of companies have created Web sites that let you shop for and order a variety of analyst research reports. Both Reuters and Yahoo Finance, for instance, allow you to enter a stock’s ticker symbol to see what analyst research is available and purchase it if you choose to. Reuters provides its analyst-report bazaar here, https://commerce.us.reuters.com/purchase/default.do , and

✓ Analyst research summary Web sites. Several Web sites let you look at the high-level summaries of analyst reports. Most of these sites give you the average recommendation of all the investors who follow a stock, which may be more valuable than just the opinion of one analyst.

Interpreting Credit-Rating Agencies’ 
Reports For Fundamental Analysis
Stock investors commonly forget the fact that they’re not alone in bankrolling 
a company. Generally, companies obtain the cash they need to operate from both stock investors and bond investors. And while stock investors look at analyst research reports, bond investors pay even closer attention to credit-rating agencies’ reports.

Chunk 1466 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
20 506455-ch14.indd   23020 506455-ch14.indd   230 9/25/09   12:21:47 AM9/25/09   12:21:47 AM231  Chapter 14: Gleaning from the Fundamental Analysis Done by Others
Credit-rating agencies, including Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch 
Ratings, look at companies very differently than stock analysts do. The role of the credit-rating agencies is to access how capable companies are of repay-ing the money they’ve borrowed by selling bonds. 
The role of reports issued by 
credit-rating agencies

Chunk 1467 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
credit-rating agencies
If you’ve ever compared a credit-rating agency’s report with a stock analyst 
report, even for the same company, you might be surprised at how differ-ent they are. Certainly, both the credit and stock reports will take a look at popular financial ratios, such as the debt-to-equity ratio and various interest coverage ratios, discussed in Chapter 8. 
But while stock analyst research reports try to help investors make money,

Chunk 1468 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the credit-rating agencies reports are primarily concerned with helping inves-tors just get their money back, with interest. 
 Bond investors are very different from stock investors. They are lending money

Chunk 1469 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
to a company, and get no piece of the upside if the company does better than expected. Bond investors simply want to get their money back from the com-pany that borrowed from them. And for that reason, credit analysts look at companies very differently than stock analysts do. For instance, credit analysts have very little interest in a company’s stock valuation. Bond investors don’t care if a stock is overvalued, as long as they get their money back.

Chunk 1470 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But while the credit-rating companies are serving a different investor, the 
bond holders, fundamental analysts interested in a company’s stock can ben-efit from the reports. Some of the aspects of credit-rating agencies’ reports that might be especially valuable include:

Chunk 1471 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ The credit rating: The credit-rating agencies assign various letter grades to companies. These letter grades attempt to give investors a quick way to determine how likely it is for a company to repay its debt, or, on the contrary, to default or miss an interest payment. Table 14-2 summarizes the credit ratings from both Moody’s and S&P, and what they mean. 
  Just as you should never take too much stock in a stock analysts’ rating,

Chunk 1472 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
you should also exercise discretion when looking at a company’s credit rating. Since the credit-rating agencies are paid by the companies to pro-vide their ratings, there’s long been suspicion that credit ratings give com-panies a great deal of leeway. It’s the analysis behind the rating, instead of just the rating itself, that has the most value for fundamental analysts.

Chunk 1473 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Analysis of how much and how often the company is borrowing: The credit-rating agencies take interest, and sometimes concern, when a com-pany borrows more money by selling additional bonds. New bond issu-ances are monitored and explored in most credit-rating agencies’ reports. 
20 506455-ch14.indd   23120 506455-ch14.indd   231 9/25/09   12:21:47 AM9/25/09   12:21:47 AM232 Part III: Making Money from Fundamental Analysis

Chunk 1474 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Risk assessment: While companies themselves pinpoint the risks facing 
their businesses in their annual reports, as described in Chapter 12, it’s often better to get this information from a credit-rating agency report. Bond investors are a pretty nervous bunch, since they’re petrified of not getting their money back. As a result, credit-rating agencies spend a great deal of time investigating things that could go wrong at a company instead of what could go right.

The death of the AAA-rated company

Chunk 1476 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Just as consumers have largely gone on a credit-binge since the 1980s, so too have com-panies. The borrowing boom by companies is extremely evident in how the number of com-panies with the coveted AAA credit rating has continued to dwindle. General Electric, which had its AAA rating from Standard & Poor’s since April 26, 1956, saw its credit rating get cut one notch to AA+ in March 2009. GE’s downgrade was a stunner, since it had the AAA rating longer than any currently operat-ing company.

Chunk 1477 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
After S&P took GE down a notch, only five 
U.S. non-financial firms were still rated AAA by S&P , including Automatic Data Processing, Microsoft, Pfizer, ExxonMobil and Johnson & Johnson. Table 14-3 shows how the number of AAA companies has been in free fall. 
There are many hypotheses on why AAA-rated 
companies are vanishing. Perhaps one of the best explanations for a fundamental analyst is how companies have increasingly elected to borrow more, or leverage themselves up. By

Getting your hands on the credit rating 
If you thought getting stock analyst reports was convoluted, that was simple compared with getting a credit-rating agency’s report. Generally speaking, you’ll need to contact your broker directly to get a copy of the credit-rating report. 
However, there are some online resources that will help you get what you 
need from the reports, including the:

need from the reports, including the: 
 ✓ Credit-rating agencies’ sites: Both Moody’s site, www.moodys.com and S&P’s site, www.standardandpoors.com will let you look up the rating on most stocks for free. You just need to register, which is free. If you need the full reports, you’ll need to contact the agencies yourself. 
  Both Moody’s and S&P provide free access to some of their broader

Chunk 1482 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Media reports: Most major news outlets have real-time access to the credit-rating agencies’ full reports and routinely issue stories on them. News outlets also have access to personnel at the rating agencies and can ask questions that go beyond what’s contained in the reports.

Knowing when a company’s 
credit rating is suspect
It’s never a good idea to take any analyst’s report on a company as fact. 
Analyst reports are based on a heavy dose of estimation. But when it comes to credit-rating agencies’ reports, and credit ratings, there’s a good way to know when bond investors themselves don’t believe what they see.

Chunk 1485 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Companies’ debt, including their bonds, trade during the day just like stocks. 
Just as stock investors buy and sell shares all day, bond investors buy and sell companies’ debt securities. The constant back-and-forth determines the price of bonds, just as trading determines a stock’s price. 
Savvy fundamental analysts know how to check the price of a company’s debt

Chunk 1486 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
and compare that to the prices of debt issued by other companies with similar credit ratings. If the prices on a company’s bonds are dramatically lower than those on debt issued by companies with the same credit ratings, fundamental analysts know investors think the company’s credit rating is too high.

Chunk 1487 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
If you’re investing in a company’s stock, why should you care if its debt rating is too high? If a credit-rating agency ultimately decides to lower the credit rating on a company, or downgrade it, that could potentially increase the company’s borrowing costs in the future. And higher borrowing costs could increase a company’s interest expense and decrease its net profit in the future. And net profit, as you discovered in Chapter 5, is critically important to funda-mental analysts.

Chunk 1488 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
There are several ways to see how a company’s bonds are trading to deter-
mine if investors think the credit rating might fall. 
 One method to see if bond investors trust the credit ratings is to look up bond prices using the Web site, called TRACE, operated by the securities regulator called Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA. You can enter any company’s name and see the prices on its bonds here: http://cxa.mar-
ketwatch.com/finra/BondCenter/Default.aspx.

Chunk 1489 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
ketwatch.com/finra/BondCenter/Default.aspx.
 A much easier way, though, to find out whether investors trust a credit rating is by using Moody’s own site. It’s free; you’ll just need to register. Below are step-by-step instructions on how to see if bond and stock investors agree or disagree with a credit rating: 
 1. Log into moodys.com.
   You will just need to enter your username and password.
 2. Search for the company’s rating.

Chunk 1490 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
2. Search for the company’s rating.
   Change the “search by” pull-down option in the upper right-hand corner 
to “Ticker.” Enter the company’s ticker symbol and click the “go” option.

 4. Hover your mouse arrow over the golden icon.
   When you do this, a small box titled “Market Implied Ratings” will pop up. 
 5. Interpret the results. 
  The first line, called Moody’s Senior Unsecured or Equiv, will show you the

Chunk 1492 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
official credit rating from Moody’s. For GE, that rating in early 2009 was Aaa, as Moody’s hadn’t yet downgraded the company’s debt as did S&P. 
  Below the line with the official credit rating, you’ll see a line called bond-

Chunk 1493 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

Next, check out the “Equity-Implied” line. This line tells you what stock investors think the company’s credit rating should be, based on a methodology used by Moody’s. In early 2009, GE’s Equity-Implied rating was Ba.

The origins of social investing

Chunk 1498 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The origins of social investing
Social investing traces its roots to the late 1990s with the rather primitive and crude concept of stock message boards . These online sites allowed investors 
to anonymously share ideas and hunches about stocks. When stock message boards started, they were a unique opportunity for investors to congregate and share ideas. 
However, the obvious problems with these stock message boards quickly

Chunk 1499 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
turned them into the investing equivalent of locker room gossip. Touts, or 
investors who try to artificially promote a company, would talk up a com-pany’s future with the hope of dumping their holdings at a profit to naïve investors. Likewise, shorts, or investors betting a company’s stock would fall, could easily spread false rumors about a company and try to drive the stock price down. 
 Stock message boards are filled with all the things you, as a fundamental ana-

Chunk 1500 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
lyst, are trying to avoid. Rather than analysis based on fact, data and analysts, the boards are stocked with amateurs just trying to spread false rumors and baseless allegations about stocks. Such rumor-mongering in stock message boards is especially problematic with stocks that don’t trade on a major stock 
market exchange.
Social investing has since evolved quite a bit. Today, there are social net-

Chunk 1501 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
working sites, which I’ll discuss in a bit, that let you see actual trades make by other investors. These sites allow you to find other investors that have similar investing strategies, such as fundamental analysis, and trade notes and ideas. There are other types of social networking sites that compile the investment ideas of many other investors into a single report, which I’ll dis-cuss in this section, too.
Why it might be worth paying 
attention to non-professionals

Chunk 1502 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
attention to non-professionals
It might seem counterintuitive and even a little amateurish to pay any atten-
tion to what lay investors think about a stock. And that’s mostly true. But, as a fundamental analyst, you want to make sure you have examined a company and stock from every direction. And if a non-professional can direct you to a gap in your fundamental analysis, you might be better off as a result.

Chunk 1503 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

Some of the areas where social investing may be worthwhile for a fundamental 
analyst include:

Chunk 1504 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
analyst include: 
 ✓ Local demand information: Some social networking sites allow investors to share potentially valuable information, such as how crowded a restau-rant chain’s locations are in various cities or how busy a retailer’s stores are. This type of information, if reliable, may serve the same purpose as an analyst’s channel check.

Chunk 1505 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Industry insight: Sometimes, investors who participate in social invest-ing sites may work at companies that buy gear from a company you’re interested in. Their comments on the quality of a company’s products or demand for the products can be useful.

Chunk 1506 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Employee’s dirty laundry: Sometimes, employees will log into social investing sites and provide data that may be helpful in fundamental analysis. For instance, between 1997 and 2001, there were more than 100 posts on a stock message board about Enron, many that outlined poten-tial problems at the firm, according to research from James Felton and Jongchai Kim in their article “Warnings from the Enron Message Board.” Some were startlingly prescient, including one in April 2001 that said Enron

Chunk 1507 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
including one in April 2001 that said Enron “is nothing more than a house of cards.” At the time of that post, most Wall Street analysts rated Enron a “buy” or “strong buy.”

Chunk 1508 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
How to plug into social networking
Unlike financial statement analysis, getting started in social networking doesn’t require any training. You just log into a Web site and get started. A few types of stock message boards and social networking sites to consider include:

Chunk 1509 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Stock message boards: The more popular stock message boards include those hosted by Yahoo Finance (finance.yahoo.com), Raging Bull (ragingbull.quote.com) and Silicon Investor (siliconinvestor.com). Again, these stock message boards are filled with misinformation, so it’s caveat emptor.

Chunk 1510 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Broker-operated sites: Online discount brokerages TradeKing and Zecco.com are some of the leaders in allowing their members to share investing ideas with each other. What these sites offer, which make them more credible than stock message boards, is that you can see the actual holdings of the members. That way, if an investor is talking up a stock, you can see if the person owns or is buying the stock. You can also see how successful an investor that person is.

Chunk 1511 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Compilation sites and dedicated social networking sites: Some sites try to spare you from having to read through thousands of messages posted by various members of social networking sites. For instance, if you enter

Finding out who a company’s biggest investors are
Some companies list all the investors who have the biggest stakes in their companies in their 10-K, or annual report filing that’s required by regulators, as discussed in Chapter 12.

Even the best company or investment can be tripped up by a lousy econ-omy. This truth was demonstrated in brutal fashion during the stock

Chunk 1526 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
economy is a major reason why you may consider expanding your fundamental analysis skills beyond looking just at the health and prospects of individual companies. Understanding the ups and downs of the economy, and the resulting business cycle, is what’s known as top-down analysis. And top-down analysis is a critical adjunct to fundamental analysis, helping you make sure you’re investing in the right companies for the right price at a good time.

to Include Monitoring the Economy
There’s no question that with fundamental analysis, the primary goal is often 
to deeply understand the inner workings of individual companies. Investors

who practice fundamental analysis are attempting to find those companies 
that stand to benefit the most given the current economic environment.

Chunk 1529 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
It’s critical to recognize that changes in the economy may have big effects 
on companies and dramatically alter your fundamental analysis. A large eco-nomic downturn, for instance, can cause a company’s revenue and earnings to plummet, turning all your expectations for the company upside down. 
How the economy has an overriding 
effect on a company
The recession that started in late 2007, as painful as it’s been, has provided a

Chunk 1530 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
startling reminder to fundamental analysts of just how captive a company’s fundamentals are to the economy. 
When the economy slows down, and consumers and companies cut how 
much stuff they buy, companies’ financial statements take a direct hit. Less spending by consumers and businesses translates directly into less revenue and earnings for companies. And revenue and earnings are precisely the things that fundamental analysts spend their time looking at.

Chunk 1531 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Sometimes, a drop in business activity can be swift and vicious, as was the 
case in 2007 and 2008. Table 15-1 shows how the earnings per share of some members of the Standard & Poor’s 500 index fell by startling amounts in 2008 as the recession ravaged the economy and their businesses.

Ways the economy can alter 
your fundamental analysis
Considering the economy’s health in your fundamental analysis might seem

Chunk 1533 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
like a pretty daunting task. After all, how can you consider something as grand as the U.S.’ economic growth when you’re poring over one company’s financial statements? 
Still, it’s important to recognize that the economy can have big-time effects 
on business, especially in regard to a company’s:

Chunk 1534 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Ability to service its debt: A company’s level of debt might look very manageable during normal economic times. In fact, as pointed out in Chapter 8, companies carrying a bit of debt will generate higher returns for stock investors. But that debt can come back to haunt companies when the economy slows.

It might be tempting to think your deft funda-mental analysis skills are so bulletproof, you’ll be able to find stocks that defy gravity and do well even when the economy is lousy. And it’s true. There were a handful of stocks that rose even during 2008, when the S&P 500 index crashed 38.5%. 
But before you think your fundamental analy-

sis can lift you above the woes of the economy, consider that even Warren Buffett faced prob-lems during 2008. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway posted a 9.6% drop in its book value, the com-pany’s worst year in its history dating back to 1965. Book value is the difference between the value of the company’s assets and liabilities, and the way Berkshire Hathaway investors tend to evaluate performance. And investors in Berkshire Hathaway’s stock weren’t spared, either. The value of Berkshire Hathaway

spared, either. The value of Berkshire Hathaway stock fell 31.8% during 2008, as the per-share price of Berkshire Hathaway’s Class A stock dropped from $141,600 a share to $96,600. Ouch.

Chunk 1539 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Buffett, in his 2008 letter to shareholders, clearly 
explains how troubles in the broad economy can translate into a slowdown for businesses, even those with outstanding fundamentals. “By the fourth quarter, the credit crisis, coupled with tumbling home and stock prices, had produced a paralyzing fear that engulfed the country. A free fall in business activity ensured, accelerating at a pace that I have never before witnessed.” Well said.

every month. The same concept goes for a company. If the economy 
causes net income to fall, what had been a manageable level of debt might become pretty difficult to handle going forward. 
  Capacity to borrow: During the credit crunch, which intensified in 2008, many companies were no longer able to borrow at favorable inter-

  During severe economic contractions, the companies with access to large

Chunk 1542 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
sums of cash are often able to make moves to improve their position when the economy ultimately heals. Some companies, for instance, may use their cash to buy weaker competitors, giving them greater market share when the economy improves.

Chunk 1543 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Cost structure: Some companies are able to adjust their costs and expenses rapidly during a downturn, unfortunately, usually by laying off workers. Yet other companies, which are capital intensive or reliant on large and expensive facilities, may have a more difficult time reducing their overhead costs. Closing a plant or facility may take longer than just giving a bunch of workers pink slips.

Chunk 1544 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Reliance on a strong economy: Some industries are more subject to the health of the economy. For instance, companies that make durable 
consumer goods such as homes, appliances and automobiles, usually see the largest drop-off in business as spending on such big-ticket items cools. Companies with profits that are closely tied to the economy are described as being cyclical. The concept of cyclicality in business will be discussed at more length in Chapter 16. 
How interest rates can alter

How interest rates can alter 
what companies are worth
The condition the economy is in can have profound effects on how much a 
company — or its stock — is worth. As shown above, companies’ earnings and cash flow may be held hostage by the ups and downs of the economy. Valuations of companies are based in large part on how profitable a company is, as you found out in Chapter 5. 
But there’s another factor you need to be aware of when it comes to incorpo-

Chunk 1546 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
rating the economy’s health into fundamental analysis: interest rates. Perhaps you’ve puzzled over why stocks often jump when the Federal Reserve, or the 
nation’s central bank, reduces short-term interest rates. If the reduction in short-

money overnight, prompts interest rates on longer-term loans to fall, that can 
affect how much companies are worth. 
 Most people assume lower interest rates are good for stocks because the 
companies can borrow money at a more affordable rate. And that is true. Lower interest rates may reduce a company’s interest expense, and boost profit. Companies might also borrow more money to expand their operations or build new stores, which might increase future profits.

Chunk 1548 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But fundamental analysis shows a more sophisticated reason why interest-
rate changes affect the value of stocks. Remember that one way to measure the value of a stock is the discounted cash flow model, or DCM, which is cov-ered in detail in Chapter 11. 
If you recall, the value of a stock today, or its present value, is a function of its

Chunk 1549 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
expected future cash flows in today’s dollars. Go ahead. Read that sentence one more time; I won’t mind. Believe it or not, it’s easiest to explain why inter-est rates are critical in fundamental analysis using the formula you discov-ered in Chapter 11. It looks like this: 
Present value = Future value / (1+interest rate) ^ time
If you haven’t read Chapter 11 yet, some of the explanation of interest rates might seem pretty technical. If you read Chapter 11, that will help, I promise.

Chunk 1550 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Imagine that you invest in a company you know will generate $10,000 in cash 
20 years from now. And consider for a moment that interest rates on savings accounts are 5%. That means you might reasonably demand an 8% return in exchange for investing your hard-earned cash in the company. The present value of the company is $2,145 right now, using a formula that looks like this: 
Present value ($2,145) = $10,000 / (1+0.08) ^ 20

Chunk 1551 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Present value ($2,145) = $10,000 / (1+0.08) ^ 20
Now imagine the economy starts to sputter, and the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. The interest rate for money in a savings account falls to 1%. You might now demand a return of 4% on your money invested in the com-pany. Just this one seemingly small change in interest rates makes the com-pany worth $4,564, or more than double its value when interest rates were higher.

Chunk 1552 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Be careful not to confuse the short-term interest rates set by the Federal 
Reserve with long-term interest rates set by investors and lenders. While short-term interest rates affect long-term interest rates, they don’t always move in lockstep.

Analyzing the Key Measures 
of the Economy’s Health

Chunk 1553 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
of the Economy’s Health
When it comes to analyzing a company, you can zero in pretty precisely. 
Companies’ financial statements allow you to dig into a company’s operations and get a good idea of what’s going on. 
But when it comes to the economy, where can you start? After all, when 
analyzing the economy, you’re not just examining the performance of a single company, but scores of businesses, consumers, and many other variables.

Chunk 1554 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
And that’s why you might think of the economy as a lab specimen. Doctors, 
trying to understand the creature, might put probes and sensors all over the specimen to try to get in tune with its vitals. Economists and investors, too, try to closely monitor the economy’s health by tracking a variety of indica-tors that all reveal clues. 
Being aware of the business cycle

Chunk 1555 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Being aware of the business cycle
Booms are inevitably followed by busts. After things get so bad, smart com-panies and entrepreneurs inevitably launch new ideas, and the economy gets going again before it overheats all over. This constant boom-to-bust is char-acteristic of the capitalist system, and is called the business cycle. It makes things interesting, don’t you think? 
Fundamental analysts generally break the business cycle down into five 
primary phases, including:

Chunk 1556 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
primary phases, including: 
 ✓ Expansion: At this point, the economy is starting to pick up steam. Economic activity is heating up, perhaps following a recession, and sometimes powered by lower interest rates. 
 ✓ Peak: The economy is running at full tilt. Hotels and airplanes are full. Companies are pumping out as much product as they can handle.

Chunk 1557 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Contraction: Uh oh. Business activity begins to slow from the unsustain-able peak levels, due to some negative event. Companies begin slash-ing costs, often by laying off workers. In 2007, business activity began to slow down after lending to home buyers started to slow and home prices fell, making consumers feel poorer. 
 ✓ Trough: When it seems like there’s bad news about the economy and things are only getting worse, the economy may have hit rock bottom.

Chunk 1558 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Recovery: Eventually, demand hits bottom, and consumers and busi-nesses start spending. Improved demand for products allows companies to hire back workers and increase production. And so the cycle starts all over again.

Using government statistics to track 
the economy’s movements

Chunk 1559 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the economy’s movements
When it comes to economic statistics, sadly, there isn’t a single number or even 
source that will give you everything you need to know. Until an economist starts Economic Indicators ‘R Us, it’s up to you, as a fundamental analyst, to know which economic data are important and where to get them. Below is a checklist of some of the important measures of economic activity, or economic indicators, you’ll want to be aware of.

Chunk 1560 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Gross domestic product, or GDP: GDP is arguably the most popular mea-
sure of a country’s economy. GDP measures how much action an economy has going on by tallying up the amount of consumption, investment, gov-ernment spending and difference between exports and imports within a nation’s borders. The GDP of the U.S. is available from the U.S. Department 
of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis at www.bea.gov.

Chunk 1561 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Inflation: Have your grandparents ever told you how they were able to buy a carton of milk for a penny? The reason that carton of milk now costs $1 or more is inflation, or rising prices. Inflation is critical to fun-damental analysis since it is connected to interest rates. For instance, if inflation starts rising uncontrollably, the Federal Reserve may need to increase short-term interest rates to slow down demand, which could hurt the value of companies.

Chunk 1562 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Key measures of inflation include the Consumer Price Index, Producer 
Price Index, and wages. Those measures track how much prices of It’s not a recession until NBER says so 
How do you know if the economy is in a reces-sion or worse? The old rule of thumb was if your neighbor was out of a job, the economy was in a recession, and if you were out of work, it was 
a depression. Fundamental analysts, though, 
need a better indication. 
And that’s where the National Bureau of

Chunk 1563 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
And that’s where the National Bureau of 
Economic Research, or NBER, comes in. The NBER is a private and nonprofit organization, founded in 1920, that researches the health of the economy. One of the NBER’s roles is to officially pronounce when a recession begins and ends. You can see when every U.S. business expansion and contraction started here: http://wwwdev.nber.org/
cycles/cyclesmain.html.
While the NBER is extremely helpful, it has its

Chunk 1564 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
While the NBER is extremely helpful, it has its 
limits. One of the biggest criticisms is that the NBER doesn’t officially pronounce the begin-ning of a recession until the economy has been contracting for some time. For instance, the NBER didn’t determine that December 2007 was the peak in economic activity until November 2008. Gee, thanks guys. And that’s why, as a fun-damental analyst, you can’t rely solely on the NBER to signal when tough times are coming.

Getting a Jump on the Future Using 
Leading Economic Indicators

Chunk 1568 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Leading Economic Indicators 
While fundamental analysts may appreciate the value of economic indicators, 
there’s a major problem. Nearly all economic indicators are backward-looking,

Chunk 1569 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
meaning that they reflect what has happened, rather than what is likely to happen in the future. Successful fundamental analysis is all about accurately forecasting what might happen to a company’s profits and revenue over the next years to decades. You’ll want to pay close attention to leading economic indicators, or those that are more revealing about how the economy might look in the future.

Trying to figure out what’s wrong with the economy is kind of like determin-

Similarly, determining what ails the economy, or trickier yet, what might

Chunk 1571 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

 Don’t feel bad if you’re not very good at predicting when the economy is fall-ing apart or when it’s improving. Even leading economists routinely make bad forecasts about the economy’s direction.

The Conference Board Leading Economic Index  attempts to give everyone a 
way to see what’s hurting the economy and whether or not things are getting 
better or worse. The indicator gets a forward-looking read on the economy by examining the following 10 factors:

Chunk 1573 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Real money supply: The number of dollars in the economic system ready to be lent and spent. Money supply is kind of like the lubrication of the economy. Money supply serves the same role as motor oil in a car engine. 
 ✓ Interest-rate spread: This measures how costly it is to borrow money. When consumers and businesses can borrow at an affordable rate, eco-nomic activity tends to pick up.

Chunk 1574 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Consumer expectations: When consumers are worried about their jobs and financial futures, they cut their spending. That slows down the economy. 
 ✓ Manufacturers’ new orders for nondefense capital goods: If companies are feeling better about the future, they may purchase new equipment and plan to expand. 
 ✓ Manufacturers’ new orders for consumer goods and materials:  
Companies ramping up production need to buy more ingredients to feed into their factories.

Chunk 1575 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Average weekly initial claims for unemployment: Companies slash jobs when they don’t see economic activity getting better. Plus, more people out of work means fewer consumers to buy goods and services. 
 ✓ Building permits: Companies must get permits to construct new proper-ties, so a slowdown in permits indicates a less bullish view of the future.

Chunk 1576 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Average weekly manufacturing hours: Large manufacturers may ask workers to cut back their hours if they need to trim costs or have employees work overtime if they expect a boom in demand. 
 ✓ Stock prices: Investors will generally start buying stocks if they expect the economy to recover within six months or so. Watching the stock market’s moves is such a valuable, early predictor of economic cycles. I’ll discuss it more fully below.

Chunk 1577 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Index of supplier deliveries: One of the first things companies do when they expect things to get better is place orders with their vendors.

Using the stock market as your 
economic early warning system
If you’re looking for an early tip-off to when the economy is either headed 
for the toilet or about to improve, it’s tough to beat the stock market. Since investors are always looking to the future, traditionally, the stock market will signal roughly three to six months ahead of time, in what direction the economy will head. 
 Again, the stock market demonstrated its predictive power in 2007. The

Digging into an Industry’s 
Fundamentals
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding how a company’s value may be affected by the industry it’s in 
▶ Getting in sync with the unique characteristics of different industries
▶ Comparing one company’s fundamentals with its industry’s to gain better insight
▶ Realizing how important the concept of market share is in powering a company’s profit

Chunk 1583 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
If you want to know what your kids are up to at school, just look at their 
friends and you’ll get a pretty good idea. It’s also common for employees 
at a company to adopt similar behavior, called corporate culture. 
As strange as it might sound, you can learn quite a bit about companies, too,

Chunk 1584 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
by examining what other companies they’re lumped in with. Oftentimes, com-panies in the same line of work, or industry, have similar financial character-istics and idiosyncrasies. The industry a company is in can also contribute to its stock price performance. 
Understanding what kind of company a company keeps is an important piece

Chunk 1585 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
of the fundamental analysis puzzle. While you may understand an individual company by reviewing its financial statements, it’s vital to understand the environment that company operates in and the industry dynamics at work. 
You’ll discover the ins and outs of industry analysis in this chapter. Not only 
will you see how a company’s industry can influence its value, but you’ll also see how a company’s fortunes may rise and fall along with the business cycle.

Chunk 1586 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Another key aspect of industry analysis is determining how well a company is doing relative to its peers. And the crucial topic of market share is discussed, as it shows how smaller companies can benefit if they can successfully steal away business from their larger and more entrenched rivals.

Chunk 1587 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Realizing How a Company’s Industry 
Can Influence Its Value
The rise and fall of companies and industries follows a pretty standard script. 
Generally, things kick off when entrepreneurs get frustrated with the prod-ucts that don’t seem to fit some kind of need they might have. By tinkering on the kitchen table or in the garage, these entrepreneurs may create a proto-type of a product and often literally sell them out of the back of their cars.

Chunk 1588 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Before you know it, this little company grows and, for whatever reason, the 
product might get so popular it threatens the survival of the companies that sold the undesirable products in the first place. Entire industries are born, and sometimes destroyed, by this constant upheaval in our economic system. 
 You want to be aware when a company you’re investing in might be threatened

Chunk 1589 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
by a game-changing company or new technology. Almost overnight, all the rev-enue and earnings on the financial statements might not be meaningful if the business model, or way the company makes its money, is turned upside down. 
The constant assault against established industries is part of our capitalist  
system. Remember air travel threatened railroads, personal computers

Chunk 1590 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
threatened large mainframe systems used in business, and the Internet is an attack on traditional media. The battle for companies, and entire industries, to remain relevant in light of new ways of doing things is something you need to account for in your fundamental analysis. 
The rise and fall of industries

Chunk 1591 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
One of the biggest threats to fundamental analy-sis is the constant danger someone will come along with a groundbreaking new business that threatens the old way of making money in the industry. One of the classic examples of this is what has happened in photography. Eastman Kodak became a blue chip company, thanks to its dominance of photography, which relied on costly chemical processing and film. Rivals that tried to take on Eastman Kodak had difficulty competing.

Chunk 1592 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But in the early 1990s, Kodak saw its industry

Chunk 1593 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
get turned virtually upside down. Suddenly, giant consumer electronics firms elbowed their way into the photography business with digital technology. At first, the photo qual-ity of digital cameras was very poor. But that quickly changed and by 2008, 65% of U.S. households had at least one digital camera. Chemical camera sales became just a sliver of the market. Suddenly Kodak faced dozens of new competitors, such as Sony and Casio, it had never faced before.

What’s in an industry? 
If you tell someone in Los Angeles you’re in “the industry” they might assume 
you’re in the movie business and try to get you to look at their script. In Detroit, people in the Motor City industry are involved in making cars. 
But when it comes to fundamental analysis, the term industry has a pretty

Chunk 1595 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
precise meaning. At its most basic level, a company’s industry is the line of work it’s in. But that’s not a scientific enough definition for fundamental analysts; they’re pretty precise folks, if you haven’t noticed already. 
Instead of just saying, for instance, Ford is in the auto industry, fundamental 
analysts break things down into more detail. Most fundamental analysts use a classification standard called the Global Industry Classification Standard ,

Chunk 1596 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
or GICS, to put companies into their places. GICS puts every industry into a sector, industry group, industry and sub-industry. GICS was co-created by Standard & Poor’s and MSCI Barra, two companies that specialize in creating ways to classify companies. 
If you’ve ever seen Russian nesting dolls, or matryoshka dolls, you already

Chunk 1597 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
know exactly how GICS works. The sector is the largest classification, inside of which fit the industry group, industry and sub-industry. Just as you open the largest Russian nesting doll and find a smaller one and so forth, the same goes with GICS. Once you see what sector a company is in, you can then see which industry group, industry and sub-industry it’s in. All these classifica-tions fit neatly inside of each other.

Chunk 1598 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Ford is a good example of how all this GICS stuff works. The company falls into

Chunk 1599 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the Consumer Discretionary sector, which contains all sorts of industry groups that make big-ticket items consumers buy, such as consumer durables. Digging further, you find Ford goes into the Automobiles & Components industry group, which contains the auto components and automaking industries. Next, Ford fits into the Automobiles industry, which includes two sub-industries: automobile manufacturers and motorcycle manufacturers. And Ford makes cars and trucks, so it goes into the Automobile

Chunk 1600 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
cars and trucks, so it goes into the Automobile Manufacturers sub-industry.

Chunk 1601 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The GICS system is pretty comprehensive. Table 16-1 shows you how many 
sectors, industry groups, industries and sub-industries there are.

Just as scientists periodically change their classifications to make room for

Chunk 1603 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
new developments regarding heavenly bodies, the same goes for industries. I’m still shocked scientists stripped away the planet title from Pluto in 2006. The GICS changes a little over time, too. Sometimes industries, for instance, are added, deleted or merged to reflect changes in the economy. Sometimes indi-vidual companies, too, are moved from different industries or sub-industries. 
 It’s probably easiest to see how all these GICS sectors, industry groups,

Chunk 1604 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
industries and sub-industries fit together by looking at a table. There are liter-ally thousands of sub-industries, but Table 16-2 gives you a very small sum-mary of what the basic structure of the GICS looks like.

Following the ups and downs of industries
Just as the economy expands and contracts along with the business cycle

Chunk 1608 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
as discussed in Chapter 15, industries also have their ups and downs. Some sectors, for instance, tend to see their business rise and fall along with the economy. These are called cyclical companies, and includes industries such as the automakers. Then there are sectors that tend to be noncyclical, mean-
ing that their performance tend to not be all that connected to the economy’s shape. The health care industry is a good example of a sector that’s usually noncyclical.

Chunk 1609 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Some fundamental analysts use industry analysis to clue into what point of the 
business cycle the economy is in. By paying attention to which industries (or sectors) are posting the best results, or the strongest stock prices, you can get a hint as to where the economy is head. 
You can see how different sectors and stocks tend to outperform during the 
different parts of the business cycle in Table 16-3.

How to Track How Sectors Are Doing

Chunk 1612 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
How to Track How Sectors Are Doing
If you want to find out how an individual company or its stock is doing, it’s relatively simple. A company’s financial statements, as described in Chapter 4, can be dug out pretty easily. And you can get stock quotes on just about any company from your brokerage firm or from financial Web sites. 
But what if you want to know which sector is leading the economy or stock 
market? That’s what I’ll show you next. 
Keeping tabs on a sectors’ fundamentals

Chunk 1613 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Keeping tabs on a sectors’ fundamentals
If you wanted to tally up how companies in a sector are doing, you could, in theory, do it by hand. You could get a list of all the companies in a sector and open each company’s financial statements and add everything up. But, man, that would be a great deal of work you can avoid. 
It’s much easier to get fundamental data on sectors from companies that track

Chunk 1614 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
these types of things very closely. S&P is one of the companies with massive databases dedicated to tracking all the earnings reported by companies and compiling them into a resource you, as a fundamental analyst, may use. All the earnings for the companies in all 10 sectors are compiled and provided to you here: http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/en/us/page.topic/indices_500/2,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0.html.

You’ll be amazed at how quickly you can process the sector data from hun-

Chunk 1616 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
dreds of companies using the S&P’s data. For instance, you can not only see how quickly earnings in the 10 sectors rose or fell in the past couple of years, but you can also monitor how rapidly analysts expect the sectors’ earnings to rise or fall in the future. S&P also provides data showing the average price-to-earnings ratio of companies in the sector. You can review how to interpret the P-E ratio in Chapter 8. Some of the sector data you can obtain from S&P looks like what you see in Table

When evaluating the profit and growth of individual companies, as discussed 
in Chapter 5, it’s a good idea to compare the results to that of the sector. This might help you identify companies that are pulling ahead of their peers. 
Tracking the stock performances of sectors

Chunk 1620 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Tracking the stock performances of sectors
Studying sectors’ fundamentals, such as earnings growth, is just one part of industry analysis. To get a full picture of how the sectors are faring, it’s important, too, to monitor their stock price changes.

 The stock market can give you an early signal to where the economy is headed

Chunk 1621 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
three to six months in the future, as shown in Chapter 15. You can apply the market’s same early-warning signal to industry analysis. When you start to see stocks in a sector rising or falling, for instance, that tells you investors think the sector’s fundamentals will follow. 
If you really want to keep yourself busy an entire weekend, you could get

Chunk 1622 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
price quotes for every stock in a sector. But why go to all that trouble if someone else makes it so easy? There are a few sources that provide helpful industry performance data, including:

Chunk 1623 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Summary of how the sectors have done over time: Standard & Poor’s provides the performance of all 10 of its sector indexes on a daily, monthly, quarterly and year-to-date basis. You can download the data into a spreadsheet for further analysis.

Using exchange-traded funds to 
monitor sectors and industries
Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are one of the more exciting things to happen

Chunk 1626 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
to the investment business. Investors who want to invest in a basket of stocks, for instance, can buy just one ETF and spread their money over dozens, hundreds or even thousands of individual stocks. 
But what do ETFs have to do with fundamental analysis? ETFs are excellent

Chunk 1627 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
tools to get real-time information on industries and sectors. Since most ETFs track various stock indexes, or mathematical calculations that measure the value of a group of stocks, they can be tremendously useful when tracking industries, too. 
The beauty of using ETFs as a way to see how a sector or industry is doing is

Chunk 1628 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
that you can get real-time stock quotes on ETFs as you would with any stock. Just enter the ETF’s stock symbol into a financial Web site to get a price. The prices of ETFs show you how sectors are doing. Many financial Web sites will

Adding Industry Analysis to Your 
Fundamental Approach

Chunk 1630 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Fundamental Approach
You may have hated it when teachers announced, on the first day of class, 
that they were planning to use the dreaded curve. The curve is pretty brutal, since getting a 90% on a test doesn’t automatically mean you get an A. If half the class gets a 90% too, you could very well end up with a C. 
The same curve-like mentality applies in industry analysis. Sometimes it’s not

Chunk 1631 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
good enough for a company to post strong revenue, earnings and cash flow. If the rest of the industry is doing just as well or better, even a seemingly out-standing performance by a company may not be impressive. 
Companies cannot be analyzed in isolation, but rather, relative to their peers.

Sizing up a company’s financials 
relative to its industry’s
Whenever you look up a piece of financial data, the first thing that should 
pop into your head as a fundamental analyst is “what does this mean?” 
Generally, no single piece of financial data is meaningful by itself. Financial

Chunk 1633 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
ratios, covered in Chapter 8, are especially irrelevant by themselves. Traditionally, fundamental analysis requires you to either compare a com-pany’s financial data with its historical results or against other companies in the sector or industry. 
Virtually any piece of financial data you can extract from the financial state-

Chunk 1634 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
ments can be compared against other companies in an industry. You can also compare financial data to industry averages to give you a better idea of where a company stands in its respective field. 
Comparing a stock’s valuation, or measure of how pricey or cheap it is com-

pared to its fundamentals, is one of the easiest things for investors to do. After you measure a stock’s P-E, you can then compare the P-E against the valuation of the industry or the stock market to get an idea of how richly valued a stock is. 
You can even evaluate statements made by a company’s management using

Chunk 1636 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
industry analysis. Here’s an example. For many years, Dell Computer often talked about just how efficient its factories were. Industry analysis lets you see if the company’s claims are true. 
 One way to verify a company’s efficiency is by comparing its inventory turn-

Chunk 1637 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
over in days, or how rapidly a company clears out inventory from its ware-houses, to the industry. A more efficient production system would have a rapid turnover, so the inventory turnover in days should be a small number. The formula is: 
Inventory turnover in days = Average inventory / cost of goods sold * 365
Dell in 2008 churned through its inventory every 7.5 days. You know that because inventory turnover in days is: 
7.5 = Average inventory ($1,024) / cost of goods sold ($50,144) * 365

Chunk 1638 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
How does Dell’s inventory turnover in days compare with the industry? It’s excellent. The computer hardware industry turns over its inventory every 34 days using 2008 data, according to Thomson Reuters. So it seems Michael Dell does know a thing about running a tight ship. 
You don’t have to calculate the financial ratios for all the companies in a 
sector to get a comparison basis. Thomson Reuters provides industry data

the stock symbol of the company you’re studying, select the Ratios button and click the Go! button. 
One thing to keep in mind, though, is sometimes you need to convert

Chunk 1640 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
industry ratios generated by systems like Thomson Reuters to match your calculation method. For instance, Thomson Reuters doesn’t convert inven-tory turnover in days, as I did above. For the computer hardware industry, Thomson Reuters gives a turnover rate of 10.69 for the industry. To convert that into inventory turnover in days, just divide 360 by 10.69 to convert the industry number into days.

Find out who a company’s competitors are
Sometimes you might find yourself getting interested in learning more about an industry or a sector. Perhaps you want to perform fundamental analysis on several companies that are competitors to one you’re looking into. 
There are several ways fundamental analysts can get a list of the other com-
panies in an industry, including the:

panies in an industry, including the: 
 ✓ The 10-K: Most companies will provide a list of all the companies they deem to be their archrivals in their 10-K, or the annual report required by regulators. Flip back to Chapter 12 to refresh your memory on where this information is located in the rather lengthy financial document.

Chunk 1643 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Web-based research tools: Several leading financial Web sites will give you a list of all the companies that compete with each other in a given industry. Enter any stock symbol at Yahoo Finance, at finance.yahoo.com, and click the “Get Quotes” button. Next, click on the “Competitors” link on the left-hand side of the page and you’ll find a list of the top rivals and some of their fundamental data. 
Considering industry-specific data

Chunk 1644 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Considering industry-specific data
Financial ratios are among the favorite tools used by fundamental analysts. You can quickly determine whether or not a company has borrowed too much, wastes too much money or isn’t growing very fast by studying financial ratios. 
Most of the popular ratios that will work most of the time are discussed in Chapter 8.
But, when performing industry analysis, sometimes the off-the-shelf ratios

Chunk 1645 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
aren’t enough. Some industries might have unique characteristics, which requires additional analysis. 
23 506455-ch16.indd   26323 506455-ch16.indd   263 9/24/09   10:39:40 PM9/24/09   10:39:40 PM264 Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
Companies in the financial sector are an excellent example of how industry

Chunk 1646 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
analysis may need to be tweaked to handle different industries. Most of the traditional free cash flow measures and cash burn techniques, discussed in Chapter 7, just don’t apply to financials. Banks and brokerages, often, have cash on deposit from their customers. That cash cannot be used to fund operations. 
Due to the special way fundamental analysis must be applied to certain 
industries, analysts often adopt unique methods. Such industry-specific finan-

Chunk 1647 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
cial measures can help you better analyze some of the oddities of certain industries.
 Again, the financials are a great example. Many financial analysts know to truly 
see how strong a bank is financially, they must examine both its Tier 1 and Tier 
2 capital. Tier 1 is considered to be a much more reliable measure of financial

Chunk 1648 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
staying power than Tier 2 capital. Banks must disclose how much Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital they have, but getting that information requires digging into the footnotes to the financial statements. 
Fundamental analysts who specialized on financial companies also study 
industry-specific measures such as a bank’s level of loans that are 90 days past due, loans that have been completely written off, and the level of reserves a bank has taken to cover loans if they go bad.

Chunk 1649 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Some of the fundamental analysts who took the time to do industry-specific 
analysis saw that many of the banks were less solid than the traditional ratios implied. 
Taking stock of raw material costs
Much of fundamental analysis dwells on the end result. You assess a compa-ny’s bottom line and see how many assets and liabilities it ends up with after selling goods and services to customers. 
But industry analysis encourages you to examine a company, almost the way

Chunk 1650 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the executives running the firm would. And that includes paying attention to how much a company must pay for its raw materials. As you know from analyzing income statements, the amount of money a company spends to buy raw materials used to make products is considered a direct cost, and is included in its cost of goods sold, or COGS. The more a company pays for raw materials, the higher its COGS, and the lower its profit.

Chunk 1651 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Sometimes, increased demand for a commodity, such as energy or agricultural products, can drive the price of raw materials up. As a fundamental analyst, if you see the prices of raw ingredients rising, that might be a tip-off a company or industry that buys those ingredients might see its future profits fall.
23 506455-ch16.indd   26423 506455-ch16.indd   264 9/24/09   10:39:40 PM9/24/09   10:39:40 PM265  Chapter 16: Digging into an Industry’s Fundamentals

Chunk 1652 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Bloomberg keeps an up-to-date list of prices of many commodities companies 
use as raw materials. You can access this information, for free, here: http://
bloomberg.com/markets/commodities/cfutures.html.
Remember, just because the prices of a commodity a company relies on is

Chunk 1653 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
rising doesn’t mean profits will take a hit immediately. Many companies use hedging, or complex financial instruments that let them lock in raw material prices for many months, or even years. You can find out if, or how, a com-pany is hedging the risk of higher commodity prices in the 10-K. 
It’s mine! Paying attention 
to market share
One of the most dramatic ways of paying attention to what’s going on in a

Chunk 1654 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
company’s industry is market share. Market share tells you how much of a certain line of business a company controls. 
You can measure a company’s share of either large industries or smaller 
sub-sets of the industry. For instance, if you’re studying a software company, you might want to find out what the company’s share of the overall software industry is. Or, you might drill down, and find out what percentage of the Web-browser software market a company has.

Chunk 1655 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
While market share may be measured on very precise markets, that level of 
industry analysis usually requires analysis that goes beyond what’s available in the financial statements. Sometimes, you need to consult with specialized market research firms if you want to know what percentage of total sales of a product type a company has.
For instance, going back to the software example above, the leading makers

Chunk 1656 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
of Web browsers, including Microsoft (Internet Explorer), Mozilla (Firefox), Google (Chrome) and Apple (Safari) may or may not disclose what they esti-mate their market share to be. There are firms that estimate market share for this type of software. 
Still, using routine fundamental analysis, you can get a pretty good idea when

Chunk 1657 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
other companies are eating each others’ lunches, so to speak. You can use the financial statements to monitor changes in revenue, for instance, to see who is benefitting from the weakness of some of the players in the business. 
Market share analysis demonstrates the counterintuitive fact that a company 
may be able to increase profit, even in a tough economic environment, if it’s able to steal business from rivals.

Chunk 1658 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

Table 16-6 presents a simple demonstration on how you can see whether one 
company in an industry may be taking business away from other players. The table shows total revenue reported by three large computer makers, Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Apple. 
Examining this chart shows you how Apple, which is a smaller PC maker

Chunk 1659 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
than the other two, may have profited by cutting into the computer busi-ness. Apple’s slice of the total revenue generated by the big three PC makers doubled between 2000 and 2008 to 15.3%. Meanwhile, Dell saw its total share of revenue fall a bit to 29%.
Using total revenue to measure a company’s market share is kind of a blunt

Understanding Why to Consider Trends 
Historians like to say that while history may not repeat itself, it definitely

Chunk 1667 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
rhymes. And that’s the same idea when it comes to searching for trends, or patterns, in a company’s fundamentals. Companies that experience high prof-itability and have large barriers to entry are often able to protect themselves against the ravages of competition and deliver solid results to investors over time. Fundamental analysts who track a company’s long-term record, or trend, can then get a decent estimate of what the future might hold. Trend

Chunk 1668 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

 Businesses that are very difficult, or very costly, to start up from scratch are

Chunk 1669 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
said to have high barriers to entry. Barriers to entry might also be the regula-tory hurdles that must be cleared before a new company can get into busi-ness. Another barrier might be the existence of a company in the field with a dominant brand name or technology. Companies that enjoy barriers to entry tend to have financials that are more stable and predictable, since competition is less of a threat. 
When trends can be very telling 
about a company’s future

Chunk 1670 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
about a company’s future
Everyone has a bad day once in a while, if not a bad month or even year. The 
same goes for companies. It’s not uncommon for a company to hit a rough patch, perhaps due to an unexpected economic slowdown. A company’s net income or revenue or both might take a big hit in any given year. 
But when is a bad year something to get worried about? Investors who don’t

 Trend analysis can save you from myopic and short-term thinking. Sometimes

Chunk 1672 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
it’s best to consider an example. Rewind back to 2002. Just to refresh your memory, that year, technology companies were suffering a dramatic downturn in their business. Technology spending fell off a cliff in 2002 as companies cut back. Technology stocks started to crash in 2000 and continued falling for years as investors figured the industry’s best days were over.

or income excluding one-time charges and taxes, of $3.6 billion. That was a

decline of 5.5% from the $3.8 billion the company posted in fiscal 2001. Some 
investors, buying into the tech-is-dead argument, didn’t like what they saw. 
 But fundamental analysts who took the time to examine Oracle’s long-term

Chunk 1675 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
trend were unfazed. If anything, 2002 results were the anomaly, a disruption in what had been many years of steady growth. By studying Oracle’s previous five years of operating income, fundamental analysts saw the company had grown by an compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 30.6% between fiscal 1997 (ended May 31, 1997) and fiscal 2001 (ended May 31, 2001). Table 17-1 below shows how steady Oracle’s operating income had been leading up to the 2002 slowdown.

 Hopefully you’re wondering how I just calculated the CAGR, because I’m about 
to show you. CAGR is calculated using the same present value formula you dis-
covered in Chapter 11, just rearranged a bit. The formula looks like: 
CAGR = (Last amount / starting amount) ^ (1 / number of years)

Chunk 1677 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Yikes. I know what you’re thinking: That’s one ugly-looking formula. You’re right: it’s not going to win any beauty contests. But using the Oracle data as an example, it won’t be so bad. All you need to know is the: 
 ✓ Last amount: This is the financial result for the latest year that you’re studying. For Oracle, this is operating income for fiscal 2001, or $3,777. 
 ✓ Starting amount: Here is the starting financial amount. For Oracle, this is operating income for fiscal 1997, or $1,299.8.

Chunk 1678 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Number of years: The sum of the years you’re calculating the average return. This is a little tricky. While we’re analyzing five years of Oracle’s financial history, there are really only four full years of growth: from 1997 to 1998, from 1998 to 1999, from 1999 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2001.

The resulting formula looks like this:

Chunk 1679 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The resulting formula looks like this: 
CAGR = (3777 / 1299.8) ^ (1/4) – 1
After you run these numbers, you should come up with 0.306. To convert that 
into a percentage, 30.6%, simply multiply by 100.
 The ^ symbol tells you to take the number in the previous set of parentheses to 
a power. Most calculators will help you do this using a key, usually labeled yx.

Chunk 1680 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
If you and math just don’t get along, this might be another reason why you might want to invest in a financial calculator such as Hewlett-Packard’s HP 12C. The calculator can crunch these present-value problems down with just a few keystrokes. 
Attempting to forecast the 
future using trends
Trying to forecast what a company might earn in the future is extremely dif-
ficult. Many Wall Street analysts get paid big bucks to attempt to forecast future revenue and profit.

Chunk 1681 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Historical trend analysis can be a helpful way to approach this extremely dif-
ficult task of forecasting. Sticking with the Oracle example, you can see how trend forecasting could be used to get a decent idea of how things would turn out after the 2002 tech decline. 
It turns out fiscal 2002’s disappointing results were followed by another dif-

Chunk 1682 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
ficult year. Operating income fell another 3.7% in fiscal 2003, pretty much cementing the doubters’ beliefs that even the biggest technology companies had finally hit a wall, and the growth was gone. 
Trend analysis, though, would help you know that growth wasn’t gone. It was 
just moderating a bit. Imagine that in 2002, when things looked bleak, you decided Oracle’s days of increasing operating income by 30% might have ended. But what about half that? Wouldn’t 15% growth be doable?

Chunk 1683 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
While 15% growth isn’t 30%, that’s still outstanding growth for a company of 
Oracle’s size. A forecast of 15% growth, at a time when tech companies were struggling in 2002, would have seemed outlandish. But in reality, you would have been very close to what actually happened. Oracle’s actual compound average annual growth rate between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2008 was 18.4%, as shown in Table 17-2.

Paying close attention to Oracle’s financial trends could have been very prof-itable for you. Had you invested in Oracle’s stock on June 18, 2002, right after it announced the lower earnings, and held through the end of its fiscal 2008 (ended May 30, 2008), you would have gained more than 150%. The market during that same time period gained just 40%. 
 When forecasting a company’s future profit, it’s often best to use operating

Chunk 1686 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
income, as I did in the Oracle example above. Operating income strips out one-time charges and gains, which are impossible to forecast, aren’t repeated and can muddy up a historical analysis. 
Attempting to forecast the future 
using index-number analysis
Following the tremendous downturn in business when many companies

Chunk 1687 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
suffered in 2008, fundamental analysts began wondering about the value of forecasting based on trend analysis. After all, how can you trust a historical analysis when one bad year can come along and knock the whole model to smithereens?
One way to make sure your fundamental analysis has a long-term time horizon

Chunk 1688 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
is by using index-number analysis. Despite the fancy name, index-trend analysis is just a way to see how a company’s financial results are changing over time. This analysis includes recent drastic ups or downs, but also lets you see the broader, long-term trend. You found out how to apply index-number analysis to the balance sheet in Chapter 6.

Chunk 1689 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Index-number analysis, though, can also be applied to the income statement to 
help forecast a company’s growth rate into the future. The analysis attempts to help you put short-term declines in business into perspective. 
 To perform an index-number analysis, you just need to choose a year to act as 
a starting point, or base year. You then divide each year’s results by the base year and multiply by 100 to get the index number for the year.

Chunk 1690 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
For instance, imagine using Oracle’s fiscal 2000 operating income, $3,080, as 
the base year. To calculate the index number for fiscal 2001, simply divide that year’s operating income of $3,777 by the base year of $3,080, multiply by 100, and you get 122.6. Table 17-3 shows you how the index analysis puts Oracle’s downturn in fiscal 2002 and 2003 into perspective. Despite the down-turn, the Oracle’s operating income kept chugging along.

Applying moving averages 
to fundamental analysis
Another technique used in long-term forecasts in fundamental analysis is the

Chunk 1692 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
moving average. With this analysis, investors attempt to smooth out unusual bumps in a company’s results. A moving average serves the same role as your seatbelt when your airplane hits turbulence.

 Moving averages may be applied to annual results or to quarterly results, 
based on how volatile the company’s profits are.

Chunk 1693 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
based on how volatile the company’s profits are. 
To conduct a moving-average analysis, you first must choose how many 
years you want to incorporate. A common time period would be three years. You add up the company’s results over three-year chunks and then divide by the number of years, or 3. Table 17-4 shows you what a three-year moving-average analysis on Oracle’s operating income would look like. 
Table 17-4 Getting a Move On with Oracle

Chunk 1694 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Table 17-4 Getting a Move On with Oracle
Fiscal year ended Three-year operating-income moving average at the end of . . . (in $ millions)
2004 $3,643 
2005 $3,912 
2006 $4,418 
2007 $5,156 
2008 $6,367
Using this analysis, you can see that the company’s compound average annual growth rate based on five moving-average periods is 15%. That might be a reasonable basis with which to make a forward-looking growth forecast. 
A word about restated results and trends

Chunk 1695 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
A word about restated results and trends
Whenever you perform long-term trend analy-sis, as you’ve been practicing in this chapter, it’s imperative to pull all the data from a com-pany’s most current annual or quarterly report. And that’s due to a dirty little secret known as restatements. 
From time to time, companies may come out and

Chunk 1696 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
From time to time, companies may come out and 
say, oops, remember when we said we made X in 2007? Scratch that. We actually made Y. If the restatement, or change in past financial results, is large enough, or material, the company may issue a formal statement. But other times, if they’re small changes, a company may simply alter the numbers in the latest financial state-ments. 
Restatements are another reason why the

Chunk 1697 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Restatements are another reason why the 
annual report required by the regulators, or 10-K, is one of your best friends in fundamen-tal analysis. The portion of the 10-K called Selected Financial Data is a very useful source of the freshest data, including any restatements. Most companies provide the most up-to-date numbers for key elements of the income state-ment, including revenue, operating income, net income and balance-sheet items going back at least five years.

Trading Information
In what’s one of the harsh realities of fundamental analysis, no matter how

Chunk 1699 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
carefully you examine a company’s financial statements, you’ll probably never know more than the CEO does. After all, the CEO is in constant contact with the company’s customers, suppliers and employees, and has access to financial data you’ll never see. 
And that’s why you’ll want to know how to watch trends in what top execu-
tives are doing when it comes to their company’s stock. Officers and direc-tors of a company are permitted to buy and sell their stock, called legal

Chunk 1700 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
insider trading, as long as they follow specific disclosure rules. Looking for trends in the transactions of executives, though, can sometimes tip you off to issues. 
 Legal insider trading is very different from illegal insider trading. When a com-

Chunk 1701 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
pany’s officers or directors use knowledge of material, nonpublic information, or important financial data that have not been shared with everyone, they run the risk of committing illegal insider trading. Many executives try to avoid the appearance of illegal insider trading by instructing their brokers to sell the company stock they own at a prescheduled time each year. 
When a CEO is bullish, should you be, too?

Chunk 1702 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
When a CEO is bullish, should you be, too? 
Ever go to a restaurant and notice the workers are eating the restaurant’s food, too, on their lunch break? There’s something kind of comforting about seeing the people in charge of a company using its products. 
Fundamental analysts carry that same idea when looking at companies. It’s

Chunk 1703 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
often considered to be a positive sign when a company’s top management, including the CEO, is buying shares of the company. If nothing else, it’s com-forting to at least know that the CEO stands to lose money, too, if things don’t work out. 
 Even CEOs aren’t perfect. Sometimes CEOs’ own optimism can lead to not-so-

great investments in their company’s stock. In 1998, then-dominant PC seller CompUSA began reporting softening earnings, and the stock price was skid-ding. But James Halpin, an experienced retailer and CEO of CompUSA at the time, couldn’t have been more bullish about the company. He spent $3 million of his own money buying 200,000 shares of the company’s stock. “I didn’t wake up one morning and say, ‘Gee, I have this $3 million … what am I going to do with it?’ ” Halpin told Investor’s Business

Turns out, though, the company’s future wasn’t all that bright. The company 
replaced Halpin just a few years later, says Hoovers.com. Eventually the com-pany wound up selling most of its stores and was ultimately sold. 
Paying attention to when a company 
buys its own stock

Chunk 1707 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
buys its own stock
Some investors think the ultimate bullish signal is when companies announce 
they’re buying back their own stock. What could be more bullish than a com-pany investing in itself, right? From time to time, when a company feels espe-cially flush with cash and deems its stock price to be too low, it might plan to buy outstanding shares. 
 Turns out, though, companies have had pretty lousy timing when it comes to

Chunk 1708 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
buying their own shares. Companies spent a record $158 billion buying back their stock in the second quarter of 2007, only to pay peak prices ahead of the market’s gigantic swoon. As companies were paying up for their stock, the Standard & Poor’s 500 hit its bull-market peak on Oct. 9, 2007 and proceeded to fall into one of the worst bear markets since the Great Depression. So much for good timing. Table 17-5 shows you how much companies have spent buying back their stock in recent years.

Chunk 1709 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
2007 wasn’t the first time companies had lousy timing buying their own stock. 
Stock buybacks surged in the first quarter of 2000 ended in March, just when the market was peaking and about to collapse.

There are additional risks to stock buybacks other than bad timing. When 
companies use cash to buy their own stock back, that is cash that wasn’t used to invest in future products or even to reduce the company’s debt load. 
Watching when the insiders are selling

Chunk 1711 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Watching when the insiders are selling
When insiders sell stock, it almost instantly gets everyone’s attention. Investors might fear the executives know something they don’t when there’s a great deal of selling going on. 
 Don’t assume just because the management team is selling shares that you

Chunk 1712 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
should dump your holdings, too. CEOs may sell their stock for lots of reasons, such as paying for junior’s college or a new car or home renovation. But when you see a flurry of selling at a company, or an industry, it pays to be extra skeptical. 
Many investors were shocked and surprised by the dramatic meltdown of the

Many of these executives, as a group, sold 4.8 million shares in July 2005, says Thomson Reuters. That was the largest level of selling in the industry since Thomson started keeping records in 1990. The timing couldn’t have been better, since the homebuilders’ stocks hit their peaks on July 20, 2005. 
How to track insider selling

Chunk 1714 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
How to track insider selling
Now that you’ve seen how watching what the insiders are doing can be some-what telling, you probably can’t wait to get started. Here’s the problem. You probably can’t call or e-mail the CEOs of companies you’re investing in and ask them if they’re buying or selling. 
Fundamental analysis, again, is your way to get the full story. There are two 
main ways to track the insider buying and selling at companies, including from:

Chunk 1715 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Companies’ regulatory filings: Given how sensitive the topic of insider selling is, you can imagine how regulated it is. There is a whole array of filings executives must provide to the Securities and Exchange Commission when buying or selling company stock. 
  The most common form containing insider-selling activity is Form 4.

Chunk 1716 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
When an executive buys or sells stock, that activity must be reported on Form 4 within two business days. Form 4 documents are available in the SEC’s IDEA database. Flip back to Chapter 4 if you want to refresh your memory on how to get regulatory filings from IDEA.
24 506455-ch17.indd   27624 506455-ch17.indd   276 9/24/09   10:40:29 PM9/24/09   10:40:29 PM277  Chapter 17: Pinpointing Trends Using Fundamental Analysis

Chunk 1717 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Financial Web sites: Several financial Web sites spare you the trouble of 
having to dig up Form 4 filings yourself and compile all insiders’ buying and selling in one place. 
  The Nasdaq’s Web site provides comprehensive insider-trading data. At

Chunk 1718 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Nasdaq.com, enter the stock’s symbol and click the Info Quotes button. Next, click the Holdings/Insider option located toward the middle of the page. You’ll get a summary of how much insider buying and selling is going on. You can also drill down and get the names of the executives doing the buying and selling. 
Designing Screens to Pinpoint Companies

Chunk 1719 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Designing Screens to Pinpoint Companies
With thousands of stocks and companies to choose from, it can be intimidating for a fundamental analyst to choose which stocks to start studying. After all, it could take hours to completely analyze just one company and stock. It’s not humanly possible to analyze every company available. 
Fundamental analysts often use stock screening tools to help them scan through

Chunk 1720 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
thousands of companies’ financial statements, literally, with the push of a few buttons. These screening tools scan through massive databases of fundamen-tal data on stocks to select those that meet characteristics you’re looking for. 
 Stock screening tools help fundamental analysts find stocks much like online

Screening is fundamental analysts’ way of narrowing down the search for companies that have all the traits they are looking for. By carefully instructing the screening tool to filter out the universe of all stocks for only those with certain characteristics, fundamental analysts can get a shorter list of strong candidates that deserve closer attention.

Typically, stock screens fall into one of several categories, including those 
that look for: 
 ✓ Cheap stocks: By searching for stocks with low valuations relative to their industry, such as price-to-earnings ratios or price-to-book ratios, investors can pinpoint potential bargains.

Chunk 1725 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Fast-growing companies: Investors who like to find companies that seem to have momentum on their side often seek out those with strong earnings or revenue growth. 
 ✓ Efficient companies: Pinpointing companies with strong efficiency ratios, such as accounts receivable turnover, are often the ones handling their resources effectively. Chapter 8 discusses efficiency ratios and other ratios you may decide to include in a screen.

Chunk 1726 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Well-managed companies: Ratios like return on equity and return on assets, especially compared against peers, can give fundamental analysts an idea of which companies have an able set of hands behind the wheel. 
 ✓ Financial strength: Companies with excellent balance sheets, filled with cash and light on debt, may be well-positioned to endure an economic downturn. 
 You may build screens that find companies that score well in all the areas

Chunk 1727 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
listed above. Some professional fundamental analysts screen for companies based on dozens of criteria.
Step-by-step instructions on 
building a sample screen
Now you’re ready to stop reading about screens and start building them. 
I’ll give you an example of a basic screen in this section: A list of the largest companies, based on market value, in the S&P 500 that have return on equity that’s greater than the average in their industries.

For Dummies. 
Building this sample screen requires taking these steps:
 1. Log into the screening system. You can try MSN Money at money.msn.

  In the first row of the screen, you can instruct the screener to filter its 
results for companies with market values of $3 billion or more. Click in the first block under where it says Field Name, choose Company Basics, and then choose Market Capitalization.

Chunk 1731 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Next, change the Operator to >=, which means greater than or equal to. 
Finally, change the Value block to read 3,000,000,000, which is $3 billion.
 4. Set the second criteria. Here you want to limit your list to companies

Chunk 1732 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
with better-than-average return on equity. Change the next blank, Field Name block, to Investment Return and then Return on equity. Set the operator to >=, for greater than or equal to. Lastly, click on the Value column and choose Investment Return, and then Industry Average Return on Equity. 
 5. Set the third criteria. To limit your search to companies in the S&P 500,

Chunk 1733 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
go to the third row and change the Field Name column to Company Basics and S&P Index Membership. Next, change the Operator column to =. Lastly, change the Value column to S&P 500.

But, if you’re assuming the risk of picking and investing in individual com-

Chunk 1743 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
panies, not having a knowledge of fundamental analysis can expose your portfolio to some trouble. Buying individual stocks because you believe the company’s prospects are strong may prompt you to pay sky-high valuations for untested companies with shaky fundamentals. And that’s a recipe for poor returns, as you will see by reading this chapter.
Why investing in individual 
companies is risky business
By investing in individual companies, you’re exposing yourself to specific risk,

Chunk 1744 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
or unique business challenges faced by companies. Specific risk is very differ-
ent than systematic risk, or risk faced by all stocks.
For instance, if there’s a credit crisis, as there was in 2008, that’s a systematic 
risk that will (and did) hurt just about every stock. However, if you own a company that makes widgets, and it’s found that those widgets cause cancer, that’s a specific risk to that one company. 
By using fundamental analysis to choose individual companies to invest in,

Chunk 1745 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
depending on what else is in your portfolio, you may be exposed to specific risk. In other words, if a company you’re invested in makes a misstep, you will suffer a loss other investors won’t. Table 18-1 shows you how investment risk, measured by a statistical measure called standard deviation, is much higher when investing in individual stocks rather than a broad index such as 
the Standard & Poor’s 500.
 By investing in a broad mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, which owns hun-

Chunk 1746 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
dreds of different companies, you can reduce or diversify away your exposure 
to specific risk. If fundamental analysis seems like too much trouble, you’re probably best off investing in a diversified mutual fund with low expenses. Most investors get the best results investing in diversified index funds, or 
funds that own all the stocks in popular stock market indexes.

 Standard deviation is a statistical method used to measure how risky a stock 
is by measuring how much it tends to rise and fall. The higher the standard deviation, the riskier the stock is. You want to make sure you’re getting the highest amount of return for the amount of risk you’re taking. 
Ignore the fundamentals at your own risk

Ignore the fundamentals at your own risk
It’s easy to get enamored with a stock. You might buy a pair of shoes, like them, and decide to invest in the company that makes them. Some fundamental investors believe it’s a good idea to invest in companies that make things they like or understand, for that reason. And there’s no question that having an in-depth understanding of an industry, as discussed in Chapter 16, can be a vital part of fundamental analysis.

Chunk 1750 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Just because you invest in a company that makes products you understand 
or even use, doesn’t mean you will make money. One of the great examples of the danger of buying what you know is Crocs, a maker of plastic clog shoes. During 2006 and 2007, these shoes, typically used by gardeners to keep their feet relatively clean, caught on with fashionistas. You’d see Hollywood celeb-rities and their kids wearing Crocs around, and soon they became  popular, especially with little kids.

Chunk 1751 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Investors, betting Crocs might be the next Nike, snapped up shares of the com-
pany when they were first offered to the public in an initial public offering in 
2006. Shares closed on their first day of trading in February 2006 for about $14. And for a while, the investment looked like a real winner, and investors chased the stock all the way up to nearly $75 a share by October 2007. 
But investors who ignored the fundamental signs showing Crocs’ earnings growth

company’s ability to stay in business. The importance of auditor warnings is covered in Chapter 12.

Curious what the fundamental warning signs of Crocs were? I’ll consider Crocs, and ten other real-life examples in Chapter 20, where I discuss how fundamen-tal analysis could have helped you avoid big blow-ups.
Why digging out of a hole is so difficult

Chunk 1754 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
One of the top reasons why you want to use fundamental analysis is that investment mistakes are incredibly difficult to recover from. Many times when companies start to stumble, they have a tough time regaining control. When you invest in an individual stock, you’re betting that the company’s corporate governance, covered in Chapter 9, will be strong enough to kick out the failing management team before things get out of hand. But you also need to have faith the board of directors will bring in

Chunk 1755 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
have faith the board of directors will bring in a qualified replacement to fix the company.

Chunk 1756 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
And that’s just the business risk of making an investment mistake. Don’t forget 
the mathematical cruelty when it comes to digging out of an investment hole. Table 18-2 shows just how hard it is to make up for drastic losses. 
Table 18-2 Digging Out of a Hole Is Hard to Do

Chunk 1757 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
fundamental analysts borrow techniques from technical analysis and cut their losses. Technical analysis, covered in more detail in Chapter 19, often calls for investors to sell a stock if it falls 10% or more from their purchase price to avoid devastating losses.

The dangers of initial public offerings
If there’s a time when investors often turn off 
their reasoning and fundamental analysis skills, it’s with IPOs. With an IPO, a company that had been private offers its shares to the public for the first time. There’s often a great deal of hoopla and excitement when a company’s shares are in the public’s grasp. 
Some investors love to buy IPOs, practically

Chunk 1759 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Some investors love to buy IPOs, practically 
sight unseen. And it’s not because there’s a lack of information on IPO. Companies going public for the first time must provide everyone inter-ested in investing with a regulatory filing called the prospectus. A prospectus is a gigantic file 
of regulatory disclosures that are kind of like the 10-K, 10-Q and proxy statement all rolled into one. Prospectuses contain all the financial statements you could ever want.

Chunk 1760 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But often, new companies coming public have

Chunk 1761 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
such a positive story, investors can’t seem to help themselves. Here’s a startling fact: A huge number of companies aren’t even profitable when they’re launching their IPOs. In 2008, for instance, 43% of all companies launching an IPO lost money, says Jay Ritter, professor of finance at the University of Florida. And get this: Back in 2000, 80% of the companies that sold stock to the public weren’t profitable. Investors, though, ignored the fundamentals and bought these IPOs anyway.

Chunk 1762 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
As you’re probably guessing already, investors 
who buy IPOs with no understanding of the fundamentals are usually sorely disappointed. Investors who bought IPOs between 1980 and 2005, and held the stocks for three years, wound up lagging the rest of the stock market by 20.3%, Ritter says. 
Some IPO wipeouts are especially stunning.

Chunk 1763 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
One that comes to mind is Blackstone Group, a private-equity firm that sold shares to the public for the first time in June 2007. Private-equity firms were the hot thing on Wall Street in the mid-2000s, as they bought companies with bor-rowed money and sold them for a profit. Since private-equity firms had a cachet to them, many common investors couldn’t wait to get a piece of Blackstone’s stock. Blackstone closed its first day at $35.06. But, again, investors doomed themselves by paying top

Chunk 1764 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
again, investors doomed themselves by paying top dollar for a risky busi-ness. The credit crunch hit, and Blackstone shares sank to $6.53 at the end of 2008 for a crushing 81% loss for investors.

Avoiding bubbles and manias
From time to time, stock investors lose sight of the fundamentals. Bubbles, or periods of time when prices of investments get disconnected from their fun-damental value, are a reality in a market economy. When the public is allowed to set the prices on assets in a free-for-all auction, it’s inevitable that some-times prices in the short term are pushed to levels that are difficult to justify with reason.

Chunk 1766 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
When you start hearing other people who don’t know how to study a company’s 
earnings and revenue telling you what stocks to buy, the market may very well be in a bubble. Caveat emptor.

Sometimes the entire stock market enters a bubble. Sometimes a particular

Chunk 1767 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
part of the stock market gets bubbly. And sometimes, just a few stocks or types of stocks see their prices shoot up to the stratosphere. Having the self-control to avoid these investments with inflated prices is extremely difficult, since everyone around you who is buying them keeps making money. But fundamental analysis can provide a few things to watch out for as a warning prices might be getting ahead of themselves.
Price-to-earnings ratios getting inflated

Chunk 1768 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Price-to-earnings ratios getting inflated
When investors start to lose their discipline and begin chasing stocks, you might start to notice P-E ratios are getting inflated. The long-term average for P-Es is generally 15, so when you notice a company’s P-E get dramatically higher than that you’ll want to take notice. You’ll want to analyze a stock’s valuation, including its P-E and PEG ratios, to get an understanding of how rich the price is.

Chunk 1769 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
If you’re interested in trying to figure out when an individual stock’s P-E is

Chunk 1770 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
starting to get lofty, one approach is suggested by BetterInvesting, a large group for investment clubs. BetterInvesting provides electronic software and forms that help you measure how lofty a stock’s P-E is relative to earnings forecasts and its historical P-E. A stock is considered to be a “buy” when its P-E falls into the lower one-third of its historical range. Stocks are considered a “sell” when the P-E lands in the upper one-third of the historical range. The methodology gives you a way

Chunk 1771 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
historical range. The methodology gives you a way to evaluate P-Es using a company’s historical valuation.

Chunk 1772 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Dividend yields sagging
A stock’s dividend yield, or annual dividend divided by the stock’s price, can give you a heads-up on a stock that may be part of a bubble. When a stock’s dividend yield drops well below the average in its industry, or what’s paid by other companies, you might start to wonder whether investors are paying up too much for promises. Similarly, you might be suspicious if one company is the only one in an industry not to pay a dividend.

Chunk 1773 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The more investors pay up for a stock, the more the dividend yield drops, 
making the dividend yield a decent indicator to pay attention to. You can look up dividend yields paid by other companies to see what the norm is. 
 Dividend yields often get very low when investors get too bubbly about the

Chunk 1774 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
prospects of the stock market, as they did in both 2007 and 2000, as shown in Table 18-3. Don’t assume, though, when a stock’s dividend yield gets unusu-ally high that it’s a screaming buy. When a stock’s dividend yield gets very high, that may be a signal the company is about to cut the dividend or run into some serious financial difficulties.

Price-to-book ratios skyrocketing
If you ask an investor and an accountant how much a company is worth,

Chunk 1776 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
they’d approach the question very differently. The accountant might start counting up all the assets, or things the company owns, and subtract all its liabilities, or things it owes. By subtracting the liabilities from the assets, the accountant would come up with the book value of the company. That, the accountant would attest, is the company’s value. 
Investors, though, approach the valuation question very differently than

Chunk 1777 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
accountants. Investors might try to figure out how much someone else would be willing to pay for the company. The price at which a company would sell, the investor might say, is how much the company is worth. 
 What happens when the accountants and investors disagree? You’ll see it in

Chunk 1778 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the price-to-book ratio, which is covered in more detail in Chapter 8. If investors and accountants agree on the value of a firm, the stock’s price-to-book ratio will be 1. If investors think the company is worth more than what the accoun-tants are saying, the price-to-book will be greater than 1. And if investors think the value of the company is less than what the accountants claim, the price-to-book ratio will be less than 1.

Chunk 1779 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
When you see a company’s price-to-book soar, sometimes it can be a tip-off 
its stock is in a mini-bubble. Google, for instance, was a stock that could do no wrong in 2006 and 2007. Investors drove the company’s price-to-book ratio to about 10, as shown in Table 18-4, in 2007. Investors, though, found out the hard way that buying pricey stocks can be dangerous.

 Here’s one of the biggest problems with using fundamental analysis to avoid big

Chunk 1781 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
stock declines: timing. Stocks’ valuations can remain inflated for some time and correct with little warning. Consider Google. In 2004, the Internet search com-pany’s price-to-book ratio was nearly 20, but the stock still proceeded to nearly quadruple over the next three years. This is another reason why no single fun-damental indictor can be completely relied on. And it’s another reason why for many investors, stymied by the timing needed to pick stocks, might be best off simply buying and

Chunk 1782 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
pick stocks, might be best off simply buying and holding a diversified basket of many stocks.

Chunk 1783 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Profitability becomes meaningless
When you start noticing companies that lose money hand-over-fist posting huge stock-price gains, it’s time to be on bubble watch. A company’s fun-damental value is based on its earnings and cash flow, as you discovered in Chapter 11. Using that logic, if a company doesn’t have any earnings, it doesn’t have any fundamental value. Unless by performing industry and trend analysis, you can be confident the company can generate profits, you should steer clear.

Chunk 1784 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
We’ll likely find out in a few years or so whether or not Buffett was right and 
Treasuries were actually in a bubble. But the lesson still applies: Bubbles can inflate in any corner of the financial markets, not just the places where the fast-money crowd hangs out. 
Finding and Avoiding 
Financial Red Flags 
It’s a sad reality that despite all the protections provided to investors, buying

Chunk 1785 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
stock is still largely a buyer-beware endeavor. That’s especially the case when buying a large stake in a single individual company. If the company’s

management makes a mistake, whether honestly or dishonestly, shareholders 
may end up paying the price. 
 I cannot stress this enough. When you buy common stock in a company, you’re

Chunk 1786 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
last in line for any assets that might be left over if the company is sold off. Employees and bondholders are paid first, often leaving the stock investors in the failed company with nothing.
Bubbles can come from unlikely places

Chunk 1787 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
There’s certainly a “type” of stock that ends up being caught in a bubble. Most of the time, bubble stocks come from an industry that seems boundless with possibilities that cap-tures the imagination of the uninformed public. The Internet stock bubble of the late 1990s was the classic example of the type of stock with the potential to become a bubble. Investors had endless optimism for what the Internet, and companies taking advantage of it, could accomplish. There’s no question the Internet

Chunk 1788 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
accomplish. There’s no question the Internet itself proved to be a giant innovation and has completely changed global business. But most of the Internet companies investors bet on either suffered massive stock crashes or van-ished completely.

Chunk 1789 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Some investors, though, incorrectly figure they

Chunk 1790 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
can avoid bubbles if they just steer clear of the overhyped stocks that are on the front pages of the newspapers or the favorite playthings of day traders. But that’s simply not the case. It’s not the type of investment itself that determines whether it’s in a dangerous bubble. Any stock, bond, collectible or commodity can find itself in a bubble. It’s the valuation, or price you’re paying, that determines whether or not you’re one of the investors helping to inflate an invest-ment bubble.

Chunk 1791 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
One of the best examples of an unlikely bubble

Chunk 1792 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
occurred in 2008. Investors got so worried about the health of the banking system during the financial crisis they piled into debt sold by the U.S. government, called Treasuries. To show you just now strange this situation was, Treasuries are just about the least exciting investment you can buy. It’s odd to even have the words Treasuries and bubble in the same sentence. Treasuries usually pay relatively low rates of interest and watching their prices change is akin to getting front row seats

Chunk 1793 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
prices change is akin to getting front row seats for a turtle race. The lure of Treasuries is that they’re backed by the U.S. government, and therefore, are considered a super-safe place to stash money.

Chunk 1794 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But you have to remember the level of panic in

Chunk 1795 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
2008. Investors were practically stuffing cash under their mattresses, Treasuries became all the rage since they were seen as the last safe place to put money. Investors bought Treasuries with such ferocity they arguably pushed their prices to bubble-like levels. At one point in 2008, the prices on Treasuries were at such nose-bleed levels investors were getting negative returns. In other words, investors were willing to buy Treasuries and lend the government $1, just so they could be sure

Chunk 1796 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the government $1, just so they could be sure they’d get 99 cents back in a few years.

Chunk 1797 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The bubble prices of Treasuries even caught 
the attention of famous investor Warren Buffett. In his 2008 letter to Berkshire Hathaway share-holders, he wrote: “When the financial history of this decade is written, it will surely speak of the Internet bubble of the late 1990s and the housing bubble of the early 2000s. But the U.S. Treasury bond bubble of late 2008 may be regarded as almost equally extraordinary.”

A real-life pattern for suit-worthy 
shenanigans
All sorts of shenanigans, both those that are pushing the limits and those that

Chunk 1799 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
are outright fraudulent, often leave investors feeling cheated and caught off guard. Many investors, feeling there’s no other recourse, may band together to sue a company or its management team in a securities class-action lawsuit.

The rationale behind shenanigans

Chunk 1801 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The temptation to cook the books, or make financial statements look better than reality, is very big. Management teams running companies have a tre-mendous amount at stake when it comes to the financial results. One disap-pointing quarter could erode investors’ confidence in the company’s plan and knock the stock price down. And since executives and members of the board of directors often own big chunks of company stock, they don’t want to see the value of their holdings fall. A vast majority

Chunk 1802 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the value of their holdings fall. A vast majority of executives’ pay is often tied to their company’s stock price. If the stock falls, they just took a massive pay cut.

Chunk 1803 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Flexibility in the accounting system may give executives the leeway they need to legally add a penny or two a share to earnings, helping them to make sure they meet Wall Street’s ever-increasing demands. Some executives figure just a few pennies here or there won’t hurt anyone. 
25 506455-ch18.indd   29025 506455-ch18.indd   290 9/24/09   10:41:07 PM9/24/09   10:41:07 PM291  Chapter 18: Avoiding Investment Blow-Ups with Fundamental Analysis

Chunk 1804 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Financial smoke-and-mirrors used by management teams can be very diffi-
cult for investors to detect, unless they get tipped off and know exactly what to look for in the financial statements. And the ability for management to manage earnings, or tweak financial statements to make them look more posi-tive, is a huge issue fundamental analysts must contend with. 
Red flags that signal shenanigans

Chunk 1805 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Red flags that signal shenanigans
In Part II, you’ll find all sorts of troubling things that might show up in the individual financial statements. In this section of the book, though, I spotlight a few of the more common warning signs you need to be particularly vigilant to watch for. 
 Some of the red flags discussed below aren’t illegal. But they all can cause 
financial results to be manipulated to the point that your fundamental analysis might be compromised.
Swelling accounts receivable

Chunk 1806 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
If you start seeing the accounts receivable item on the balance sheet sky-rocket to the point where it’s outpacing revenue growth, that can be a bad thing. The accounts receivable line item grows when a company sells product to a customer, and accepts an IOU in exchange. If you see accounts receiv-able growth outpacing revenue growth, you might wonder if the company is pushing product onto customers to boost revenue. The way a company decides when to book revenue, called revenue recognition,

Chunk 1807 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
when to book revenue, called revenue recognition, may have a pro-found influence on its results.

Chunk 1808 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
For instance, Internet software company PurchasePro in late 2000 reported 
a $13.2 million quarterly jump in accounts receivable to $23.4 million. That should have caught fundamental analysts’ attention, since the company’s rev-enue was just $17.3 million for the period. The company a year later restated results, and the Securities and Exchange Commission ultimately accused company executives of committing fraud. 
Overvalued intangible assets

Chunk 1809 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Overvalued intangible assets
When you think of a company’s assets and read about them in Chapter 6, actual property the company owns that can be touched or seen probably comes to mind. But those types of assets, called tangible assets, are only one part of what a company owns. Companies also have what are called intan-

Chunk 1810 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
gible assets, or items believed to have value that cannot be seen or touched. When intangible asset values are inflated, fundamental analysts might believe a company to be worth more than it is in reality.

 Many fundamental analysts completely disregard intangible assets when mea-

Chunk 1811 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
suring the book value of a company. Since many of these assets probably couldn’t be sold if the company were to be liquidated, it’s often safe to leave them out of your analysis. 
Massive big-bath and “one-time” charges 
One commonly used trick by companies is the so-called big-bath restatement.

Chunk 1812 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
When a company is about to report a poor quarter, it makes it really bad. A company’s management writes down the value of assets or pays some expenses ahead of time, which makes the current results look really bad. But by getting all this bad news out, the company sets itself up for the illusion of a better future. Best of all, some investors automatically look past one-time charges, assuming they’re just unusual events. But the fact is, these restate-ments can have a profound effect on

Low “Quality” earnings
Accounting rules are supposed to make a company’s financial statements more reflective of reality. For instance, companies are expected to book rev-enue when a sale is made, not necessarily when cash is received on the sale. Booking revenue this way ensures that the revenue is matched up with the costs incurred to generate that revenue. 
But this accounting technique, while of merit, can open the doors to manipu-

Companies that do this are considered to have earnings of low quality. The statement of cash flows is a fundamental ana-lyst’s best weapon in finding and steering clear of companies with low-quality earnings.

Increasing borrowing, or leverage
If the bear market and credit crunch that began in 2007 taught investors any-thing, it’s the danger of borrowing too much. The same lesson was learned by investors. Some companies, including Bear Stearns and Lehman Bros., had so much exposure to debt, or leverage, they were unable to hold themselves together when business turned south.

And while entirely legal, debt can also distort some of the popular measures

Chunk 1820 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
fundamental analysts consider when evaluating companies’ profitability. Return on equity, a commonly used financial ratio used to measure the effec-tiveness of a management team, is especially vulnerable to distortion from the use of debt. You can read about return on equity, and how it’s skewed by debt, in Chapter 8.
 General Electric is an example of how some investors may not have fully

Chunk 1821 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
understood how debt can have a big-time influence on fundamental analysis. GE’s return on equity in March 2009, based on its financial returns from the previous 12 months, was a respectable 16.3, says Thomson Reuters. That was right in line with the industry’s average of 17.8. 
But if you look at the company’s return on assets, a financial ratio which strips

GE’s use of debt caused return on equity to be relatively high, even though its return on assets was relatively low at the same time.
Again, nothing is illegal about borrowing, and I’m not suggesting at all that it 
is. Debt can be a critical portion of a company’s total capital structure, since it

And just because a company’s historical fundamentals look strong doesn’t mean its business can’t deteriorate and put the company in jeopardy. On the flip side, sometimes companies that look like real dogs can turn things around and sur-prise investors on the upside. Don’t forget, too, that no matter how good you might be performing fundamental analysis, your assumptions might be off, leading to poor investment decisions.

Chunk 1827 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
These complications of fundamental analysis are big reasons why some 
investors consider adding a dose of technical analysis to their technique. Technical analysis, the study of patterns in stock prices, is used by investors who think they can use the opinions of other investors to see something in a stock’s future. 
Marrying technical analysis with fundamental analysis, in some ways, is

Understanding Technical Analysis

Chunk 1829 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Understanding Technical Analysis
If you’ve ever seen an investors’ desk that’s covered with all sorts of charts 
with squiggly lines or computer screens displaying graphs, you may have found a technical analyst.
Technical analysts are often called chartists because they spend their time

Chunk 1830 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
poring over stock price charts. These charts show where a stock price has been over time and how many investors have bought or sold the stock. Technical analysts believe historical patterns in a stock price’s movement can give solid clues about where the stock might be headed in the future. 
 It’s important to remember many academics take strong exception to techni-

Chunk 1831 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
cal analysis. Studies have shown a stock price’s movement in the short term is tied to news events, which are random. Stock price charts, academics say, tell you nothing other than what a price was in the past. Longer-term stock prices respond to a company’s earnings and cash flow, which are not predicted by anything on a stock price chart, many academics insist.
Sometimes it does seem technical analysts get a bit carried away with the

Chunk 1832 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
art of their craft. Some technical analysts read stock price charts almost like a clairvoyant studies the lines on a client’s palm. With that said, technical analysis is often mentioned by investors, so it’s worth knowing a bit about. More importantly for fundamental analysts, though, is that some of the meth-ods used by technical analysts may be useful for investors who are focused on revenue and earnings. 
Reading the stock price charts

Chunk 1833 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Reading the stock price charts
The primary tool used by technical analysts is the stock price chart. These charts, available on just about any financial Web site, usually plot a stock’s closing price every day. Charts usually come in several forms, including the:
 ✓ Line: Most of the stock price charts you see are usually line charts. Line charts, as their name implies, are simply a connect-the-dots line linking the closing prices of a stock each trading day.

Chunk 1834 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ High-Low-Close: Line charts are simple, but they do obscure some of the relevant data from trading. If you look at a line chart, there’s no way to know how high or low stock prices got each day. The High-Low-Close chart, shown in Figure 19-1, attempts to solve this shortcoming of line charts. On each trading day, there’s a vertical bar, with the top portion representing a stock’s high price and the bottom, the low. Then there’s a line through the middle of the bar showing the price at which

Chunk 1835 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the middle of the bar showing the price at which the stock closed.

 ✓ Candlestick: Candlestick charts pack even more information than line

Chunk 1837 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
or high-low-close charts. Candlestick charts not only show you a stock’s high, low and close, but also its open price. A stock’s open price is the very first price in a trading day that buyers and sellers agreed upon. The indicator on a candlestick chart looks like a rectangle with a vertical line protruding from the top, to mark the stock’s high, and from the bottom, to mark the low. You can take a look at a sample in Figure 19-2.

What technical analysts are 
looking for in the charts
If you’ve ever heard a technical analyst speak, it might seem like a bit of 
voodoo. Usually, technical analysts have a pen or marker in hand, start scrib-bling all over a price chart and talk about all sorts of patterns that they see. If you’ve ever been to a star-gazing presentation at an observatory, you pr obably

Chunk 1839 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
26 506455-ch19.indd   29726 506455-ch19.indd   297 9/24/09   10:41:57 PM9/24/09   10:41:57 PM298 Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
get an idea of what it’s like hearing a technical analyst describe a stock chart. 
Technical analysts try to connect dots on charts to find patterns they say can be revealing about a stock’s future. Technical analysts are looking for several things in the charts, including:

Chunk 1840 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Price patterns: If there’s one thing that technical analysts fixate on, it’s the shape of the charts. Technical analysts think investors, being human, follow predictable cycles of fear and greed. These emotions cause stock prices to follow predictable scripts, or patterns, that may indicate where the stock is headed.

Chunk 1841 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ What other people see: Even if you do all the fundamental research pos-sible, you can still be dead wrong. Technical analysts attempt to look at a stock chart to either confirm or deny their belief about a stock’s future. If a stock is in free fall, technical analysts would assume other investors know something they don’t and would avoid it.

Chunk 1842 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Support and resistance levels: Through the constant tug-of-war between buyers and sellers, a stock attempts to settle at a price inves-tors agree upon. Sometimes a stock will have difficultly breaking beyond a high point, or resistance level, and will routinely bounce off a low point, called a support level.

Chunk 1843 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Momentum: Technical investors often try to capitalize on the tendency of some stocks to gain steam either going up or heading down. If a stock starts to rally, technical investors take notice and assume those in the know expect the company to report something positive. 
A technical analysts’ dictionary

Chunk 1844 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
If you ever find yourself speaking with a tech-nical analyst, I’ll warn you, you might need to bring a decoder ring. Technical analysts use all sorts of sometimes funny sounding words and terms to describe certain patterns that might appear on a stock-price chart. These terms are extremely useful for technical analysts because they can, very quickly, describe the ups and downs of a stock in a way that others can instantly picture and know what they’re talking about.

Chunk 1845 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
These terms remind me a bit of the names of con-
stellations in the heavens. If someone points at the Big Dipper in the sky, you know to look for a cer-tain pattern of seven stars that looks like a soup ladle. Similarly, when a technical analyst says a stock pattern is showing a head and shoulders  
pattern, you know to look for a stock that has risen and fallen three times in a way that appears like a person’s shoulder, head and other shoulder. 
Just as there are countless names for constel-

Chunk 1846 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Just as there are countless names for constel-
lations, there’s practically an endless supply of terms to describe patterns in stock prices. Besides head and shoulders, there’s the cup 
and handle, neckline and throwback, just to 
name a few. All these terms mean very spe-cific things to the technical analyst. If you’re interested in finding out more about these pat-terns, and what they mean, you might check out Technical Analysis for Dummies (Wiley).

How technical analysis differs 
from fundamental analysis
Technical analysts and fundamental analysts are diametrically opposed to

Chunk 1848 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
one other. Get enough fundamental and technical analysts together in one room, and a fight is sure to break out. Technical analysts believe all informa-tion about a stock that’s worth knowing is reflected in its stock price. Taking the time to study a company’s fundamentals is a waste of time, a pure techni-cal analyst would argue, because everyone else has access to the same infor-mation and has either bought or sold the stock already.

Chunk 1849 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Fundamental analysts, on the other hand, claim technical analysts fall victim 
to groupthink and fixate over changes in stock prices that tell investors noth-ing about the future. What’s more, fundamental analysts claim stock prices can get overvalued when investors become too optimistic about a stock and push its price above or below the company’s intrinsic value. You can learn how to calculate a stock’s intrinsic value in Chapter 11. 
Blending Fundamental 
and Technical Analysis

Chunk 1850 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Blending Fundamental 
and Technical Analysis
While fundamental and technical analysis couldn’t be more philosophically 
opposed to each other, there are ways to marry the two approaches together. In fact, the shortcomings of both fundamental and technical analysis, in some ways, balance each other out. 
A few ways to potentially boost your fundamental analysis success using 
techniques from technical analysis include:

Chunk 1851 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
techniques from technical analysis include: 
 ✓ Cutting your losses: One of the fatal flaws of many pure fundamental analysts is stubbornness. Fundamental analysts urge investors to do their homework, buy a stock and hold on for dear life no matter what happens. But during the ugly bear market that kicked off in 2007, many fundamental analysts learned the hard way that stocks can go to zero, or at least get very close. 
  One thing technical analysts are often very good at is cutting their

Chunk 1852 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
losses. When technical analysts buy a stock, they often have a stock price in mind that they’ll sell at if things go south. Knowing how to cut your losses short can be vital when investing in individual companies’ stocks, which is a risky endeavor. Some technical analysts suggest inves-tors sell a stock if it falls 10% or more from their purchase price.

 ✓ Improving your timing: Some fundamental analysts like to buy stocks

Chunk 1854 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
and just hang on. But sometimes stubbornness can be expensive. For instance, you might be sitting on a stock that’s not moving, while the rest of the stock market charges ahead. Technical analysis attempts to help you avoid sitting still when there’s money to be made in other stocks.

Chunk 1855 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Helping you to spot manias: Because technical analysis is so focused on what other investors are doing and what they’re paying for a stock, it can help alert a fundamental analyst to manias and bubbles. Knowing when other investors are getting overly enthusiastic about a stock can be a good clue to explain why a valuation might be getting overly lofty. 
Using stock prices as your 
early-warning system
Even a lifelong fundamental analyst, who looks at technical analysis as glo-

Chunk 1856 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
rified palm reading, may still benefit from the art of reading charts. When forecasting how a company’s revenue or earnings might look like a year from now, fundamental analysts need to take educated guesses at what shape the economy or the company’s industry will be in. 
Watching stock prices can be useful in helping a fundamental analyst form

Chunk 1857 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
an opinion about the future. Since stock prices tend to foreshadow economic reality three, six or nine months in advance, paying attention to stock price movements may tell fundamental analysts something about what the econ-omy might look like. 
 Monitoring industry sectors, as described in Chapter 16, may be especially

Chunk 1858 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
helpful. If you start noticing shares of companies that make durable goods, or high-ticket items like houses and cars, falling, that may very well be a tip-off that investors expect the economy to slow. That’s useful information you might consider when forecasting a company’s future earnings growth. 
Looking up historical prices

Chunk 1859 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Looking up historical prices
Even if the technical analysis tools discussed in this chapter seem a little too, well, out there for you, you can still benefit from charts and historical stock price data. Oftentimes, you might find yourself wanting to know what a stock price was in the past. Perhaps you want to look up your cost basis in a stock, 
or how much you paid for it when you originally bought it. You’ll need to know your stock basis to measure your capital gain or loss for tax purposes.

Chunk 1860 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
You may also want to know what a stock price was, say, a year ago so you can 
measure how well or poorly a stock has done.

The Primary Tools Used 
by Technical Analysts
Just as fundamental analysts pore over financial ratios and statements, tech-

Chunk 1864 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
nical analysts have indicators they examine as well. Many of the indicators technical analysts focus on are tied directly to a company’s stock price or trading history. You might review some of the items that technical analysts pay attention to and determine how to best implement them in your funda-mental strategies. 
Getting into the groove 
with moving averages
One of the first things most technical analysts plot on a stock chart is the

Chunk 1865 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
moving average. The moving average tells you what a stock’s average price has been over a set period of time. Moving averages can be calculated for any period of time, but technical analysts usually use the following time periods:
26 506455-ch19.indd   30126 506455-ch19.indd   301 9/24/09   10:41:57 PM9/24/09   10:41:57 PM302 Part IV: Getting Advanced with Fundamental Analysis 
 ✓ 10-day moving average. The stock’s average price over the past two weeks.

Chunk 1866 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ 50-day moving average. The stock’s average price over the past quarter. 
 ✓ 200-day moving average. The stock’s average price over the past year.
Technical analysts compare a stock’s current price to its moving average. If 
the stock price is greater than the moving average, that’s considered to be a bullish signal for the market. If the current stock price is less than the moving average, that’s a bearish signal.
If you’re going to choose a moving average to pay attention to, you should

Chunk 1867 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
go with the 200-day. Technicians get very cautious when a stock price falls below the 200-day moving average, and may wait on the sidelines before buying back in until the stock rises above the 200-day moving average. When a stock falls below the 200-day moving average, that means that every inves-tor who bought the stock within the past year, on average, is losing money. If the stock creeps upward, many of these disappointed investors are eager to dump the stock, making it difficult for the

Chunk 1868 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
to dump the stock, making it difficult for the stock to rise.

Chunk 1869 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Keeping an eye on trading volume
Technical analysts are very interested in a stock’s price and the trend of the price. But most technical analysts also pay close attention, too, to how much trading volume is occurring. Trading volume measures how much investors are buying or selling a stock. If buyers and sellers are furiously trading shares back and forth, then trading volume is considered to be high, or active.

Chunk 1870 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
When trading volume is active, technical analysts figure they can trust the price movement to a greater degree. For instance, imagine a stock that soars to break into new high ground, but on low trading volume. A technical analyst would be skeptical of the move higher, since a relatively small group of inves-tors powered it. Similarly, if trading volume is heavy, that tells the technical analyst there’s a great deal of volume, or conviction, behind the trade.

Chunk 1871 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Table 19-1 summarizes the way a fundamental analyst might couple reading 
volume with price movements.

Chunk 1872 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Your next question, though, might be how you can determine whether trad-
ing volume is higher or lower. The major stock market exchanges, including the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange, provide trading volume for the day and the average daily volume to most of the financial Web sites. Technical analysts compare a stock’s trading volume for the day with its average daily volume to determine whether buying and selling is active or not.

The ABC’s of Beta

Chunk 1875 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The ABC’s of Beta
Beta, or the beta coefficient, is one of those rare market indicators that both fundamental and technical analysts can agree has value. Beta is a statistical measure of how volatile a stock is relative to the stock market at large. You might recall, from Chapter 11, how beta is used in the capital asset pricing 
model used to build a discounted cash flow model. 
 While beta is based on a somewhat complex statistical technique, as an inves-

Chunk 1876 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
tor, most of what you need is pretty simple. If an individual stock has a beta of 1, that means it is equally volatile as the general stock market. If beta is less than 1, then the stock tends to swing up and down less than the market. And if a stock’s beta is greater than 1, it is less volatile than the market. 
A technical analyst might look at beta to provide clues on how wild to expect a 
stock’s ups and downs to be. Beta is available from nearly all financial Web sites.

ers, use a series of maneuvers to position themselves to profit if a stock falls.

Chunk 1878 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Investors short a stock by first borrowing shares from another investor who 
owns them. The short seller, then, turns around and sells the shares imme-diately, pockets the proceeds and waits. The short seller then must buy the shares, hopefully at a lower price, and return them to the investor they bor-rowed from. If the stock falls, the investor makes money by buying the shares back at a lower cost than they sold them for.

Chunk 1879 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
You might never decide to bet against a stock yourself. But it may be useful 
for a fundamental analyst to know just how many people are shorting a stock they do own. There are three things to pay attention to when it comes to short interest: 
 ✓ Short interest: A stock’s short interest is a measurement of how many shares of a company’s stock have been sold short. 
  Just looking at short interest doesn’t tell you a whole lot. A company

Chunk 1880 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
with more shares outstanding, or shares in investors’ hands, would natu-rally have more short interest than a company with fewer shares out-standing. You’ll want to compare short interest with another measure to get proper perspective, as I describe below.
 ✓ Average daily share volume: Remember volume, mentioned above? This data will be helpful again in interpreting how significant short inter-est is by putting short interest into perspective.

Chunk 1881 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Days to cover: Days to cover tells you how large a company’s short inter-est really is. Days to cover is calculated by dividing a stock’s short inter-est by its average daily volume. This statistic indicates how many days of typical trading it would take for the number of shares being shorted to trade hands. 
 The higher a stock’s days to cover is, the more heavily shorted it is. Fortunately,

Chunk 1882 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
all three types of shorting data described above are available at Nasdaq.com. Just enter a stock’s symbol into the site and a window will pop open. Click on the Short Interest option listed below where it says “Fundamentals.” 
Determining what short interest means to a fundamental analyst is bit tricky.

Chunk 1883 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Some fundamental analysts actually like to see a stock that’s heavily shorted. If you’re completely confident in your fundamental analysis and know what a company is worth, and believe the stock is undervalued, heavy short interest can actually be a good thing. When stocks are heavily shorted, if the com-pany delivers solid earnings, investors who shorted the stock may scurry to buy back the stock.

Chunk 1884 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
A rush by nervous short sellers to buy back a stock they wrongly bet against is called a short squeeze. Short squeezes can cause powerful stock rallies. 
26 506455-ch19.indd   30426 506455-ch19.indd   304 9/24/09   10:41:57 PM9/24/09   10:41:57 PM305  Chapter 19: Marrying Fundamental Analysis with Technical Analysis
But fundamental analysts tend to view a heavily shorted stock as a warning

Chunk 1885 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
sign. After all, an investor who shorts a stock is exposed to a theoretically infinite loss, since there’s no real limit to how high a stock can rise. If inves-tors are that confident a stock is going to fall, you want to make absolutely sure you’ve done a complete job with your fundamental analysis. 
Keeping a Close Eye on Options

Chunk 1886 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Keeping a Close Eye on Options 
To be sure, fundamental analysis is all about knowing how to study a com-pany from top to bottom and understand what it’s really worth. A classic fundamental analyst only pays attention to a market price for a stock when deciding whether it’s undervalued and should be bought, or overvalued and 
should be sold. 
And for the most part, looking at the stock’s current price is enough to tell

Chunk 1887 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
you what the market measures a stock’s value to be. A stock price is the result of a vigorous back-and-forth between buyers and sellers. Through an auction, conducted largely over vast and rapid electronic trading networks, a stock’s price rises and falls until buyers are satisfied with the price they’re paying, and sellers are OK with the price they’re getting. 
But there’s an entirely separate layer of trading that takes place beyond the

Chunk 1888 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
buying and selling of the stock itself in the options market. Options are finan-cial contracts that give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell stocks at a prearranged price at a set time in the future. 
 Watching the prices of stock options can give you a better idea of not only 
what investors are willing to pay for stocks now, but their belief of where a stock might be in the future. You might want to factor in the prices of options in your fundamental analysis.

Chunk 1889 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Understanding the types of options
Options come in two most basic forms, put options and call options. Put options give investors the right, but not the obligation, to sell a stock at a predetermined price at a set time in the future. Call options, on the other hand, give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy a stock at a pre-determined price at a set time in the future. 
Investors may buy and sell both put and call options, driving their prices up

Chunk 1890 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
and down, just as they would trade stocks. Table 19-2 shows you the four most basic options strategies, which you’ll want to understand in order to know how to interpret prices on options.

Paying attention to put 
and call price levels
If you want to get an idea of what investors are expecting from a stock, you’ll 
want to take a look at its option chain. An option chain tells you how much investors are paying for both put and call options that expire, or come due, at 
different times in the future.

Chunk 1892 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
different times in the future. 
Option chains are usually sorted by strike price, or the price at which the 
option kicks in. For instance, imagine you bought a call option for stock ABC at a strike price of $25 that expires in December. That means you have the right, but not the obligation, to buy the stock at $25 a share in December. 
Fast-forward to November. Imagine the stock is now trading at $100 a share.

Chunk 1893 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Suddenly, having the right to buy a $100-a-share stock for just $25 a share is valuable, or in the money. However, if instead of trading for $100 a share, what if the stock is trading for $2.50? Not many people would want the right to buy a $2.50 stock for $25. At that point, your option is considered to be out 
of the money.
 If you start noticing the price of call options with strike prices above the cur-

Chunk 1894 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
rent market price going up, that’s an indication investors are expecting good things from the stock in the future. 
 Some technical analysts also pay attention to the volume, or level of trading activity, in options, too. In fact, the amount of trading in put and call options is the basis of another thing technical analysts watch, the put-to-call ratio, dis-

Watching the put-to-call ratio
Now that you understand what puts and calls are, you might wonder how you might put the information to use. Again, as a fundamental analyst, you’re much more concerned about a company’s revenue and earnings rather than 
26 506455-ch19.indd   30626 506455-ch19.indd   306 9/24/09   10:41:57 PM9/24/09   10:41:57 PM307  Chapter 19: Marrying Fundamental Analysis with Technical Analysis

Chunk 1896 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
short-term trading noise. But, monitoring the level of puts and calls can tell 
you how many other investors either agree, or disagree, with your assess-ment of a company’s value. 
The put-to-call ratio gives investors a quick look at how bullish or bearish 
investors are on a stock’s prospects. The ratio is simply the number of puts (which are bearish) divided by the number of calls (which are bullish). 
The higher a stock’s put-to-call ratio, the more pessimistic investors are

Chunk 1897 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
about a stock’s future. 
You could calculate a stock’s put-to-call ratio yourself, but it’s easier to use 
online resources that do it for you. You can get the put-to-call ratio from Schaeffer’s Investment Research at www.schaeffersresearch.com. Enter the stock’s symbol in the upper right-hand corner and click the ‘get quote’ button. Scroll down and click on the Put/Call Open Interest Ratio option, and you’ll see the put-call ratio plotted for you.
Using the market’s fear gauge: The Vix

Chunk 1898 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
One of the great strengths of fundamental analysis is that it gives you a frame-work to assess how much a business is worth. That way you can make an intelligent decision on whether the stock’s price is higher or lower than the business’ value. Fundamental analysts, in fact, often get their best deals when other investors are afraid to buy stocks and push stock prices down. Warren Buffett, in his 1986 letter to shareholders, put it this way: “We simply attempt to be fearful when others are

Chunk 1899 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
“We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.”

Chunk 1900 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
One of the biggest reasons why fundamental analysts might choose to pay 
attention to technical analysis and options is that they may help you see when other investors are feeling greedy and when they’re feeling nervous. And when they’re nervous, you can be greedy.
There are many ways to get an idea of when other investors are fearful, which 
is valuable information for fundamental analysts. One popular indictor of investors’ fear is based on options trading. This indictor, called the Chicago

Chunk 1901 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Board of Options Exchange Volatility Index  or Vix, is often looked at as a pretty 
valuable measure of investors’ fear. When the Vix is rising, that means inves-tors are getting increasingly nervous. And when the Vix is falling, that means investors are getting complacent. 
You can obtain current values of the Vix from the CBOE at http://www.

Perhaps you’re reading this book because you disagree with technical analy-

Chunk 1904 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
sis for the reasons highlighted above. Maybe you’ve tried technical analysis before and gotten burned. Still, even if you’re primarily interested in a com-pany’s fundamentals, don’t assume this chapter doesn’t apply to you. While technical analysis is often a dirty word among fundamental analysts, there are some techniques used by technical analysts that can easily be carried over to fundamental analysis. 
In the sections above, you find out how to add technical analysis to your

Chunk 1905 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
investment style. You may have skipped that section, figuring you want noth-ing to do with technical analysis. 
But in this section, I attempt to show you ways to some tricks and techniques

Chunk 1906 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
used by technical analysts directly to fundamental analysis. This isn’t as strange as it might seem. After all, realize one of the most valuable things technical analysts do is turn mountains of complex numerical data into charts and graphs. Numbers that are indecipherable in huge spreadsheets can suddenly become enlightening when turned into a chart. Suddenly, charts can help investors quickly spot trends in data they might have other-wise of missed.

Chunk 1907 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Even if you’re a die-hard fundamental analyst, there is something to be said 
about placing investment data on charts that can be closely studied. In fact, the technical analysts are onto something when it comes to a few of their techniques, which can be applied to fundamental analysis. 
 One of the great drawbacks of fundamental analysis is timing. A cheap stock,

Chunk 1908 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
based on fundamental analysis, can get even cheaper if it has technical trends working against it. By applying some of the tricks of the technical analysis trade to fundamental analysis, you might spot trends you might have over-looked if you were just focusing on the income statement and balance sheet. 
26 506455-ch19.indd   30826 506455-ch19.indd   308 9/24/09   10:41:57 PM9/24/09   10:41:57 PM309  Chapter 19: Marrying Fundamental Analysis with Technical Analysis

Chunk 1909 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Giving fundamental data the technical 
analysis treatment
Some technical analysts love charts so much, they might even plot out some 
data that are traditionally considered to be for fundamental analysts. Even if you’re not onboard with technical analysis, there’s no question that some-times, seeing fundamental data presented graphically may help you spot trends. 
 Plotting fundamental information, rather than just looking at table stuffed

Following the momentum of fundamentals

Chunk 1914 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Following the momentum of fundamentals
Technical analysts are often interested in following the momentum of stock 
prices, meaning the prevalent trend either upward or downward. Just as col-
lege basketball teams often get momentum during big games and start going on a hot streak, technical analysts believe stocks can turn hot and have the gust of investor enthusiasm at their backs. Momentum investors hope to pile into a stock while it’s still soaring, grab a quick gain and get out.

Chunk 1915 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Classic momentum investing is contrary in most ways to fundamental analy-
sis. But fundamental analysts might consider borrowing a bit from this con-cept, as strange as it sounds, when examining fundamental data. 
 By watching for momentum in a company’s fundamentals, you might get a tip-
off that something meaningful is taking place at a company.
One way to apply the concept of momentum to fundamental analysis is by

Chunk 1916 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
studying earnings acceleration. Here, you’re not just looking for companies that are increasing their profitability every quarter or year. You’re being even pickier. You want to find companies that are increasing the rate at which earnings are growing. 
 Fundamental analysts generally use quarterly earnings as their gauge for a 
company with momentum. Momentum, by its nature, is short-term focused so it makes sense to use short-term data.

Chunk 1917 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
To perform an earnings-acceleration analysis, you just need to have a com-
pany’s earnings growth rate for the last few periods. While it’s usually done using quarterly results, the analysis can be done using quarters or years. Below is an example of how you might do this analysis using Oracle’s net income for four past years, shown in Table 19-3. 
Table 19-3 Oracle’s Annual Net Income
Fiscal year Net income ($ millions)

Your first step is calculating the growth rate between each period. A growth

Chunk 1919 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
rate is the difference between the most recently reported quarter and the same period in the previous year’s quarter. You can review how to calculate growth rates in Chapter 4. Once you measure each year’s growth, you get a chart that looks like what you see in Table 19-4. 
Table 19-4 Oracle’s Annual Net Income Growth
Fiscal year Annual Growth
2008 29.2%
2007 26.4%
2006 17.3%

Chunk 1920 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
2008 29.2%
2007 26.4%
2006 17.3%
As you can see from Table 19-4, what’s interesting is that Oracle’s annual growth rate is accelerating. In other words, the growth of the most recent period is greater than the one before it. This is the kind of trend that a funda-mental analyst, looking for momentum, would be on the search for. 
 Fundamental analysts often look for quarterly earnings momentum, for instance,

Chunk 1921 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
when trying to figure out how successful a new product is. New products can be critical to a company’s sustained earnings growth. And if something a company introduces is catching on with customers, an earnings-acceleration analysis might show something exciting is going on at the company.

Let’s face it. Curling up with a warm cup of coffee and a stack of financial 
statements just isn’t quite as appealing as cracking open a great book.

Chunk 1926 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Sure, you might find some salacious details in some company reports -- some are even famous, including one financial statement discussed in this chapter. Overall, though, a company’s annual report filed with regulators, called the 10-K, probably isn’t going to be something you pass around in your next book club meeting. 
But, with that said, reading financial statements is still worthwhile. I’ve found

Chunk 1927 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
that investors appreciate the importance of reading financial reports when they see real-life examples of how they could have pinpointed major issues at companies well before they were known to the public.
This chapter highlights several actual examples of how investors could have

Chunk 1928 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
been tipped off to important developments at a company by reading the financial statements. A couple of the examples in the chapter are fraud. And certainly, knowing when a company is cooking its books is important, since that means you cannot rely on the financials.

Spotting One-Time Charges That Aren’t

Chunk 1930 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Spotting One-Time Charges That Aren’t
Spotting outright corporate fraud using just the publicly available financial statements can be very difficult. If a company lies to you and fabricates por-tions of the financial statements, you are at a huge disadvantage as a funda-mental analyst. Fortunately, corporate fraud, while more common than I’d like to see, still remains rare overall. 
What’s much more common, though, are companies that pad results using

Chunk 1931 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
perfectly legal tricks you need to watch out for. 
 My top suggestion on detecting when a company is using little tricks to boost 
earnings is by comparing a company’s net income with its free cash flow. I step you through this very important analysis, in detail, in Chapter 11. If you didn’t read that section during the first swing through this book, you might want to flip back and check it out now. 
Another thing to be aware of as a fundamental analyst is when companies

Chunk 1932 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
routinely take so-called one-time or restructuring charges. By classifying a charge as one-time or nonrecurring, some analysts might overlook the costs, assuming they are unusual and not indicative of the company’s core busi-ness. But when you see a company constantly taking one-time charges, be careful. 
One of the companies that seemed to make one-time charges a regular phe-

Spotting Financial Distress a Mile Away
There are many ways to protect yourself from buying a car that’s a lemon. You can look up the company’s history and even get a warranty. When it comes to avoiding a dud in investing, though, fundamental analysis is one of your best weapons. 
The best way to know whether a company is unlikely to survive is by care-
fully studying the financial statements, covered in Chapters 5, 6 and 7 and the financial ratios, discussed in Chapter 8.

Chunk 1938 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
There’s a shortcut, though, to finding whether a company is unlikely to make 
it. It’s called the Altman’s Z-score. The Z-score is a long formula that crunches down many of the things you look for and puts it into a single number. 
Z-Score = (0.717 * A) + (0.847 * B) + (3.107 * C) + (0.42 * D) + (0.998 * E)
Where: 
A: (Current assets – current liabilities) / total assets

Chunk 1939 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
B: Retained earnings / total assetsC: Earnings before interest and taxes / total assetsD: Shareholders’ equity / total liabilitiesE: Revenue / total assets
 Calculating the Z-score is just a matter of mostly pulling the data off the financial 
statements and plugging them into the formula. You can find out how to obtain 
all the data listed above from a company’s financial statements in Chapters 5 through 7. But to make it easy, I’ve listed their locations in Table 20-1.

You will find . . . . . . on the . . .

Sidestepping the Financial Crisis
Every once in a while, perhaps once every generation, there comes a shock

Chunk 1945 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
to the financial and economic system so severe, you really don’t want to get caught in the middle of it. The banking crisis that began in 2007 with the sub-prime mortgage crisis was one of those brutal economic events you didn’t want to have anything to do with. 
The crisis stunned many investors because much of the damage hit shares

Chunk 1946 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
of banks, which for many years, had been considered safe and steady invest-ments. While the severity of the crisis caught many investors off guard, there were some clues available to fundamental analysts that at least showed there were problems brewing. 
 A good place to have noticed the financial crisis gaining steam was reading 
the risks section of the 10-Ks filed by top financial institutions. Chapter 12, for instance, shows how AIG was taking blatant risks that caused the firm to implode.

Chunk 1947 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But there were other tip-offs for fundamental investors. Consider the fate of 
Cleveland’s National City Corp. The regional bank, founded in 1845, grew into one of the nation’s largest originators of mortgages. National City’s dividends and earnings were all steady. So was the stock for many years, as it marched to nearly $37 a share at the end of 2006. 
Turns out the steady results were a mirage. National City was eventually

vided a clue, had investors picked up the regulatory filings released by National City’s nearby Akron, Ohio-based rival FirstMerit. As far back as 2003, FirstMerit, which serves many of the same communities as National City, con-stantly alerted investors it was aware of some shaky mortgages on its books and was taking action to get rid of them. 
Back in 2003, FirstMerit told investors it was selling off some of its most risky

Chunk 1950 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
loans. And again, in the 2006 letter to shareholders, the CEO of FirstMerit said the company was actively identifying potentially problematic loans and deal-ing with them immediately. All these warnings came well before the mortgage crisis hit in force in 2007. 
But even as FirstMerit was paring troubled assets, National City’s 2006 annual 
report to shareholders was glowing. “Our competitors face the same issues

as we do, but we believe we’re better-positioned than most in this tougher 
environment,” then-CEO David Daberko wrote in a letter to shareholders in the 2006 annual report. 
 Savvy fundamental analysts might have wondered why FirstMerit was making

such a dramatic effort to reduce its risk, while nearby rival National City hardly made a mention of troubles until it was too late.

Staying Away from Investment Fads, 
Like the Dot-Bombs
Up until the financial crisis, the biggest implosion of the financial markets 
had to be the Internet bubble. Investors ignoring the fundamentals of com-panies rushed to buy stock of companies that didn’t make any money and sometimes didn’t even have revenue.

Chunk 1958 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Even to this day, the absurdity of the dot-com bubble remains one of the 
best reasons why anyone who buys individual stocks should take the time to understand the fundamentals. Investors who blindly jumped into technology and Internet stocks blindly got a beating of a lifetime. 
 More than 117 dot-com companies collapsed between September 1999 and

lessons on how fundamental analysis can help you avoid getting sucked into investment fads. The company’s story sounded great. The site allowed con-sumers to buy things they needed for their pets over the Internet. Great, right? 
But fundamental analysis revealed the true story. Turns out the company’s

survival was nearly impossible. Pets.com lost 19 cents on every $1 in revenue it posted in the third quarter of 2000, reported USA TODAY . And that didn’t even include overhead costs. In other words, the more product the company sold, the more money it lost. You can’t do that very long before going out of business. And it didn’t. Pets.com liquidated itself roughly one year after going public. 
 It turns out that Pets.com wasn’t alone. Nearly 60 of the 729 Internet compa-

Pinpointing Companies Fooling Investors
When trying to detect accounting fraud, there’s only so much a fundamental analyst can do. After all, you have to believe the numbers to some degree, since you don’t have the authority to go inside a company to verify its books and records yourself.

Chunk 1963 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But there are some aspects of accounting that are so commonly abused, they 
are worth constantly being on a lookout for. So-called channel stuffing would 
be at the top of my list of early fraud warnings. 
 A company can boost its revenue and profit by enticing customers to buy

Chunk 1964 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
products now, even thought they don’t want them yet, in order to boost results in the short term. Often, a company might cut customers slack in how quickly they must actually pay for the merchandise. That way, the company 
28 506455-ch20.indd   32128 506455-ch20.indd   321 9/24/09   10:43:04 PM9/24/09   10:43:04 PM322 Part V: The Part of Tens 
may book the revenue, even though no cash is collected. Clearly, this practice

Chunk 1965 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
causes a problem for the company in the future, since consumers don’t order because they have more than enough product. 
Sunbeam is a classic example of alleged channel stuffing. The SEC accused 
the company’s management of providing customers with lucrative deals in 1997 to coax them to buy product ahead of time. And the channel stuffing technique wasn’t enough to keep the fraud going, so the company resorted to even more aggressive means to prop up results, the SEC says.

Chunk 1966 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Again, techniques in this book could have at least shown you something was 
amiss. Fundamental analysis of the company’s accounts receivable turnover in days, discussed in Chapter 8, would have provided clues. This financial ratio tells you how many days it takes for a company to collect amounts owed to it by customers. In 1996, Sunbeam collected its accounts receivable in 79 days. But that period shot up to 92 days in 1997, which was a gigantic red flag.

Chunk 1967 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Always be suspicious when you see accounts receivable turnover in days 
jump up like that.
Seeing through Distortions Caused 
by Stock Buybacks
Stock buybacks occur when a company uses its cash to buy back shares 
of its own stock. There are many reasons why companies might do this, as explained in Chapter 18. 
But these buybacks can create enormous distortions to financials. While

Chunk 1968 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
there’s nothing nefarious about stock buybacks, investors might come to false conclusions unless they use fundamental analysis. Since buybacks reduce a company’s number of shares outstanding, they can inflate a com-pany’s earnings per share. Remember earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the number of shares outstanding. So if the number of shares falls, the denominator falls, and the earnings per share rises.

Chunk 1969 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The distortions caused by stock buybacks to a company’s earnings per share 
aren’t fraudulent. They’re merely the result of mathematics. Still, the effect can dramatically alter how investors perceive a company’s results. 
Take, for instance, Automatic Data Processing. The company has been finan-
cially strong for a long time, and is one of the few nonfinancial firms to earn the coveted AAA-credit rating from Standard & Poor’s. The company had

been long known for its unstoppable consistency. Back in January 2003, the 
company touted it had extended its “streak” of posting higher earnings per share for 166 straight quarters. ADP’s streak gave it the reputation of being a solid and dependable generator of consistent growth.

Chunk 1971 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But fundamental analysts who took a closer look saw that while the company

Chunk 1972 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
was telling the truth, there was more to the story. Certainly, the company’s earnings per share indeed rose 2% to 43 cents a share during the December 2002 quarter. However, that increase in earnings per share was largely due to the fact the company reduced its number of shares outstanding by spend-ing $80 million buying back 2 million shares of its stock during the quarter. Stripping out the effect of buybacks, by looking at net income, tells the real story. ADP’s net income fell 1.1% in the

Chunk 1973 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the real story. ADP’s net income fell 1.1% in the quarter to $262 million. No, it wasn’t a big drop, but the number puts ADP’s streak into more context.

Chunk 1974 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Knowing a Trend Will Come to an End
It never fails. Every couple of years, there’s a company that captures the imagination of investors. Crocs, the maker of plastic shoes that had been used mainly by gardeners and boaters, became that new darling. After debut-ing its shares as an initial public offering in February 2006, the company could do no wrong. 
Crocs’ revenue soared at a neck-turning pace, rocketing from just $1.2 million

Chunk 1975 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
in 2003 to $847.4 million in 2007. And investors didn’t miss a step, driving shares from their first day’s closing price of $14.28 in Feb. 2006 to $74.75 on Oct. 31, 2007. Investors figured the company could expand into all sorts of new footwear and keep up the growth. 
Fundamental analysts, though, knew better. For one thing, Crocs’ compound

Chunk 1976 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
average annual growth rate of 415.5% between 2003 and 2007 wasn’t sustain-able, just by using logic. If Crocs were to grow keep growing that fast, it would have exceeded the revenue of Nike in two years. You can find out how to cal-culate compound average annual growth rates in Chapter 17.
But fundamental analysis also gave investors clues the momentum at Crocs

Chunk 1977 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
was petering out. As early as the first quarter of 2007, the company’s revenue and earnings growth both fell, breaking a streak of quarterly increases in growth. Even if investors missed this first sign of trouble, there were more, including when the company posted a net loss of $4.5 million in the first quar-ter of 2008. Even at that time, fundamental investors could get out, as Crocs’ stock was still trading for $17.47 a share in March 2008.

Chunk 1978 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

But ignoring the fundamentals proved to be very hazardous. While Crocs

Chunk 1979 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
posted a small profit in the second quarter of 2008, it swung to large losses in the third and fourth quarters. At the end of 2008, Crocs shares fell to $1.24. And then, in 2009, the company’s auditor publicly questioned whether Crocs could survive as the company’s revenue fell to $126.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, down from $224.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.

Chunk 1981 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
once the economy heals. A great example of this occurred in the consumer electronics business in 2008. Clearly, the slowdown in the economy caused consumers to cut back their spending on big-screen TVs and MP3 players. And that caused a big problem for archrivals Circuit City Stores and Best Buy. 
But fundamental analysis removed any doubt which company would survive.

Chunk 1982 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
A free cash flow analysis, as described in Chapter 11, told the story. During the fiscal year ended Feb. 2007, Circuit City’s free cash flow was just $34 mil-lion, and it actually burned $355 million in cash in the fiscal year ended Feb. 2008. Considering the company only had $296.1 million in cash in February 2008, fundamental analysis told you Circuit City had a big problem. Circuit City filed for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 10, 2008, making it the 13th larg-est public company bankruptcy in

Chunk 1984 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Contrast Circuit City’s standing with the situation at Best Buy. Best Buy had a 
sizeable chunk of cash, $1.4 billion, in the bank at the end of its fiscal year in March 2008. And while Best Buy felt the negative impact of the economy, as did Circuit City, it still generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow in its fiscal year ended March 2008. Clearly, Best Buy was in a position to survive. 
 Correctly choosing which company can withstand a tough economic period

Watching for Market Saturation
When companies start out, investors can’t help but expect limitless growth.

Chunk 1986 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Many of the most successful stocks in history include brand-new concepts for stores, such as Home Depot and Starbucks, which seemed to have no end in sight as to where they could open stores. 
Guess what? There were limits. Especially in retail, investors at first get

Chunk 1987 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
overly optimistic about how many cities and communities can support a new concept. Investors rush into the stock, assuming its blistering pace of open-ing new stores will never end. But inevitably, as fundamental analysts know, it’s possible to build one too many locations. After time, market saturation 
sets in. 
Starbucks remains a classic example of a chain which has tremendous growth

Chunk 1988 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
prospects, but there were still limits. Since being founded in 1971 with its first store, Starbucks seemed able to open as many stores as it wanted, and then open even more. The company added hundreds of stores a year starting in 1994 and by 2007 there were nearly 16,000 Starbucks locations worldwide. 
But in July 2008, the first signs of market saturation become apparent when

Chunk 1989 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the company said it would close about 600 company-owned stores in the U.S. Investors, used to Starbucks turning coffee into liquid gold by constantly opening new stores, didn’t like what they heard. Shares of Starbucks fell nearly 40% from the July announcement through the end of 2008, trailing the rest of the stock market by about 10 percentage points amid a tough time for the economy.
Fundamental analysts, though, saw this market saturation coming. And it

Chunk 1990 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
didn’t take any fancy financial formulas to spot these warnings. In the quar-ter ended March 2008, Starbucks reported its largest decline in net income growth, 28%, since 1998. 
And even more alarming, the company’s return on assets fell to an unchar-
acteristically low 7% for Starbucks. That was half the return the company earned on its assets in the quarter ended Dec. 2007. It was clear the company wasn’t getting the kinds of returns it traditionally did from its stores and assets.

Earnings Are “Real”
If you’re not a full-time fundamental analyst, and you own more than a hand-
ful of stocks, it would be a full-time job to constantly monitor in real-time every bit of financial data you’ll want to be aware of. 
So here it is. My suggestion on the one form of fundamental analysis you

Chunk 1997 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
should never skip is the measurement of a company’s quality of earnings. As soon as you can get your hands on a company’s income statement and state-ment of cash flows, you want to make sure a company’s cash from operations is greater than or equal to its net income. When a company is generating cash flow, you have some proof the earnings are real, not just smoke and mir-rors allowed by accounting. You can review how to conduct this analysis in Chapter 11.

Chunk 1998 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Comparing a company’s cash from operations to its net income only takes a 
few moments. The payback for this small investment of time is huge. If you avoid investing in companies with weak cash flow relative to their net income, you may sidestep many bum investments or even outright frauds. 
Considering How Much Cash 
the Company Has
It would be pretty rude to ask strangers you meet at a cocktail party how

Chunk 1999 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
much money they have in their savings accounts. But you don’t have to worry about such etiquette when it comes to companies. Before you invest a dime in a company, you want to make sure you not only know how much companies have, but also what they owe. You should know: 
 ✓ How much cash a company has on the balance sheet.
 ✓ How much the company owes to lenders in the short term and long term.
 ✓ How much cash a company generates.

Chunk 2000 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ How much cash a company generates.
Paying close attention to these four variables will help you avoid plunking your money down in a company that may not survive.

Making Sure You Don’t Overpay

Chunk 2001 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Making Sure You Don’t Overpay
Investors are constantly surprised when they spend hours and hours analyz-ing a company’s fundamentals, only to buy a stock and still lose money. 
There are countless forces at work to determine a stock’s price. Remember,

Chunk 2002 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
stock prices are set by the constant tug of war between buyers and sellers trading shares back and forth until settling on a price everyone can agree upon. And that’s why it’s critical for you to not only evaluate how solid a company is, but also how profitable it is and whether it has staying power. It’s imperative not to pay too much.

Chunk 2003 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Studies have shown that growth stocks, or shares of companies with the high-est valuations measured by price-to-book ratios, are often the biggest disap-pointments for investors. This means that the more you pay for a stock, the lower your future return is likely to be. 
Evaluating the Management Team 
and Board Members
As an investor in a company’s common stock, or the shares issued to the public

Chunk 2004 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
representing standard ownership in the company, you’re at the mercy of the management team to make the correct decisions with your money. And you’re counting on the board of directors to keep a watchful eye on the man-agement team. If you can’t trust the management team and board of directors, you shouldn’t trust them with your investment. 
 If you don’t look at anything else in the proxy statement, always be sure to

Chunk 2005 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
look for related party transactions between executives or board members and the company. These are side business dealings with the potential to cor-rupt the ability of executives or board members to represent the interests of investors like you. And even if a CEO is doing an excellent job, be watchful of excessive pay packages. CEOs that aren’t ashamed to lavish themselves with excessive pay probably aren’t afraid to take other liberties with your money. Review Chapter 9 for tips on how to dig

Examining the Company’s Track 
Record of Paying Dividends
Day traders used to scoff at investors who paid attention to dividends. During 
stock market booms, these small cash payments some companies pay to 
their shareholders seem almost insignificant. 
But fundamental analysts know better. For one thing, dividend payments

Chunk 2008 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
account for a big portion, roughly 4 percent, of the returns generated by stocks over time. Miss out on those payments, and you’re leaving quite a bit of cash on the table. Also, steady dividends can make sure you’re earning something on your money even if a stock is flat. Dividend payments can also be helpful in helping you decide how much a stock is worth, as described in Chapter 10. 
Lastly, while companies can fudge or pad their earnings, dividends can’t be

Chunk 2009 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
faked. Dividends are usually actual cash payments you can deposit in a bank account or spend. Companies paying dividends are at least showing you a tangible sign of their profitability. 
Comparing the Company’s Promises 
with What It Delivers
It’s easy to simply take a company management’s word as gospel. Financial 
television is especially infamous for practically turning corporate CEOs into royalty and taking everything they say at face value.

Chunk 2010 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
That’s not to say you, as a fundamental analyst, need to treat CEOs as crooks 
or liars. But it is up to you to verify claims made by a CEO. If a company’s CEO says a new product is selling like crazy, take the time to look at its rev-

Chunk 2011 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
enue growth and also the accounts receivable turnover in days to ensure cus-tomers are buying and actually paying for the goods. If a company claims to have posted record profits, it’s up to you to not only verify the claim, but also make sure it wasn’t the result of accounting puffery.
 Always compare the promises made by a CEO in one year’s annual report to

Chunk 2012 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
shareholders with the reality delivered in the following year’s financial state-ments. Professional fundamental analysts often read a company’s latest 10-K with the previous one, side-by-side.
29 506455-ch21.indd   33029 506455-ch21.indd   330 9/24/09   10:43:43 PM9/24/09   10:43:43 PM331  Chapter 21: When Analyzing a Company
Keeping a Close Eye on Industry Changes
Fundamental analysis is powerful, but there is a great deal of emphasis

Chunk 2013 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
placed on financial statements. And the big weakness of financial state-ments is that they’re historical documents telling you how a company did, as opposed to how it will do. 
Trend analysis, described in Chapter 17, is one way fundamental analysts look 
beyond historical numbers to assess the future. But you need to be especially mindful of game-changing technologies or new ways of doing things in busi-ness that can render a company’s way of making money, or business model, 
obsolete.

Chunk 2014 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
obsolete. 
 The constant danger that a new technology may wipe out a company is one reason why some fundamental analysts stick with easy-to-understand and basic businesses, where consumers keep coming back. Consumer products companies, for instance, don’t have to worry that people will stop buying deodorant (at least your nose hopes so). 
Understanding Saturation: Knowing 
When a Company Gets Too Big 
Eventually, for most companies, the early days of easy growth evaporate as

Chunk 2015 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the product and business matures. A product, which might have been so new that everyone had to buy one, eventually becomes so prevalent that growth slows. And when a company expands so much, it becomes more difficult to grow further. These growing pains and maturity present great challenges to both management teams and fundamental analysts. Companies often struggle with the transition from a fast-growth company to a slower growth one, and sometimes need to change their entire strategies.

Chunk 2016 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
sometimes need to change their entire strategies. Fundamental analysts, too, much change the way they evaluate a company and measure its valuation.

Chunk 2017 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Keep a close eye on a company’s operating profit margin, or how much of rev-enue the company keeps in profit after paying direct and indirect costs. When you see the operating profit margin deteriorate, that can be a heads-up that the business’ glory days are fading.  That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t invest in a mature business. In fact, the contrary is often true. But you need to be aware that the business’ fundamentals have changed. Review Chapter 5 for methods on how to monitor profit

It’s often tempting to buy stock in a company you think is the best in a busi-

Chunk 2020 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
ness, and assume that your work is done. But companies are constantly changing and evolving. Sometimes a company’s rival might rise up from near death with a killer product and pose a huge threat. Meanwhile, the valuations of so-called leading stocks are often driven up so high that its future returns are often disappointing.

Chunk 2021 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
When looking to invest in a company, take the time to read statements and documents released by a rival company you might consider to be weaker. Paying attention to statements made by the CEO of a rival company in a letter to shareholders, for instance, might tip you off to industry trends the CEO of the leading company may not have noticed yet. 
Watching Out When a Company

Some athletes get themselves into trouble when they decide to showboat.

Chunk 2022 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
The temptation to do that one extra and unnecessary back flip or victory dance sometimes lets a quiet competitor sneak up and steal the win. 
Companies, too, can sometimes get full of themselves. Figuring that their fat days

Ten Things Fundamental 
Analysis Can’t Do
In This Chapter
▶ Setting realistic expectations of what you can expect when using fundamental analysis
▶ Describing some of the hidden costs of fundamental analysis 
▶ Highlighting how the successes of famous fundamental analysts are extraordinary
▶ Stressing fundamental analysis’ heavy reliance on guesses and estimates

Chunk 2026 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
I’d love to tell you fundamental analysis will make you instantly rich 
beyond your wildest dreams. Heck, I’d love to tell you that fundamental 
analysis will make you look 15 years younger, too.
And certainly, fundamental analysis is a very valuable tool. It can be used by 
all sorts of investors, or even by employees, members of the public, or just about anyone interested in knowing how to gauge the health of companies.

Chunk 2027 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But, fundamental analysis also has its limitations. And rather than trying to 
ignore the shortcomings of fundamental analysis, it’s important to recog-nize upfront what they are and adjust your strategy accordingly. If you don’t approach fundamental analysis with reasonable expectations and knowing what the risks are, you may certainly be disappointed with the results. 
In this chapter I outline some of the primary drawbacks to fundamental anal-

Chunk 2028 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
ysis. I hope you don’t let these shortcomings turn you off completely from fundamental analysis. After all, understanding how companies work, how stocks are valued and how to measure how profitable a business is are skills that can only benefit you. But again, you need to know what fundamental analysis can do, and what it cannot, before making ill-informed decisions.

Chunk 2029 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Ensure You Buy Stocks 
at the Right Time
The biggest knock against fundamental analysis is that it doesn’t necessarily 
help you time your investment decisions just right. You might do a beautiful job analyzing a company’s financials, identify an undervalued stock, buy it and wait to make money. And then, 10 years later, you’re still waiting and waiting. 
 Just because a stock is fundamentally cheap doesn’t mean it must soar in value

Chunk 2030 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
anytime soon; in fact, it can become even cheaper. Sometimes a stock is cheap for a reason that will reveal itself in its financial statements in the future. 
Guarantee You’ll Make Money

Chunk 2031 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Guarantee You’ll Make Money
I wish I could tell you that if you use fundamental analysis, you’ll make money on every stock you buy. But the fact is, during a bear market, even the most skilled fundamental analyst will likely suffer losses, at least on paper. During times of extreme stock market stress, some investors might wonder why they even bothered with fundamental analysis. 
One investor, who submitted a question for my daily Ask Matt investment

Chunk 2032 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
column at USATODAY .com, stated this frustration very well. “I’ve learned how to read the fundamentals, including earnings per share, price-to-earnings, return on equity and the stock price chart. But I’m still losing money. How are you supposed to research stocks anyway?”
 Hopefully this book shows you that fundamental analysis requires taking a 
close look at many aspects of a company. And even after this, fundamental analysts can make mistakes.

Consider some of the admissions made by Warren Buffett in his 2008 letter to Berkshire Hathaway investors. Buffett bought a large position in oil company ConocoPhillips during the year, when oil and gas prices were near peak levels. Buffett was thinking energy prices would go higher.

Save You Time When Picking Stocks
Some investors like to refer to fundamental analysis as an art. There’s at least 
one key difference, though, between art and fundamental analysis. After an artist is done chiseling a statue or creating a painting, he or she is done. The work stands as a completed masterpiece of enduring value.

Chunk 2037 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Fundamental analysis, though, doesn’t age well. Even after you spend hours 
completely studying all public information about a company, its stock and industry, you’re not done. New information continuously flies at you and may have an influence on your analysis. If fundamental analysis is art, it’s defi-nitely a work in progress. 
Performing fundamental analysis takes time, patience and determination.

Chunk 2038 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
You’ll need to take the time to gather, analyze and process new financial information as it comes in. Fundamental analysis can be somewhat time-consuming, as you’ll need to make sure you are studying every aspect of a company that you possibly can.
Reduce Your Investing Costs

Chunk 2039 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Reduce Your Investing Costs
There’s no question the cost of buying and selling individual stocks has fallen dramatically. If you open an account with an online discount brokerage firm, you might expect to pay $10 a trade or less as a trading commission. And cer-tainly, at $10 a trade, the trading commissions you pay won’t make a big dent in your portfolio’s return. 
But many investors make the mistake of assuming the trading commissions

Chunk 2040 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
are the only tolls you pay when you buy and sell individual stocks. Other costs include:

Chunk 2041 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Your time: Imagine if you decided to invest $100,000 in 10 different stocks using fundamental analysis. And presume that you need to spend at least an hour a week researching each stock. If you’re very good, you might happen to pick ten great stocks that wind up beating the market by two percentage points a year. Sounds great. But that additional return works out to $2,000 a year, which means you’ve only made about $4 an hour for all the work you put in, according to an analysis by Mark

work you put in, according to an analysis by Mark Hebner of Index Funds Advisors.

Chunk 2043 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Research: It’s true you can obtain a vast majority of the data you need for fundamental analysis for free. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for instance, provides free access to companies’ regulatory filings. And there’s no shortage of helpful, free sites that provide funda-mental data on companies.

Chunk 2044 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
But if you really get into fundamental analysis, you might be tempted to sub-
scribe to fundamental data and research services that will cost you money.
 ✓ Being wrong: By taking on fundamental analysis, you’re saying you think

Chunk 2045 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
you can outsmart the market. By using your ability to read financial statements and make intelligent forecasts, you may load up on shares of individual companies. And if you choose correctly, then you may benefit. However, being wrong can be costly. Remember that large U.S. stocks, on average, gained 9.2% a year between January 1928 and December 31, 2008, says IFA.com. If you pick the wrong stocks or buy or sell at the wrong time, you might sabotage the nearly 10% return you could have had for

the nearly 10% return you could have had for just buying a diversified basket of stocks and holding on.

Chunk 2047 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
✓ Tax hits: Buying and selling individual stocks may generate tax events, which could eat into your return. You can read more about the role taxes play below.
 While fundamental analysis has its costs, picking your own stocks could 
actually save you money versus investing in actively managed mutual funds.

Chunk 2048 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Actively managed mutual funds employ professional money managers who select stocks and decide when to get in and out. Some of these mutual funds charge large fees. These fees, disclosed as part of a mutual fund’s expense 
ratio, can cost you 1% of your investment a year or even more. If you’re con-vinced you don’t want to put your money in a low-cost index fund, and instead are invested in a fund that charges a large expense ratio, it’s possible you might save money by picking stocks yourself.

Getting started with investing
In this book, I assume you’re already familiar with setting up a brokerage account or may already have a relationship with a broker-age. But if you don’t already have a brokerage account, don’t underestimate the importance of this decision. In fact, choosing the right type of account to use for investing can be as important or even more important than choosing stocks using fundamental analysis. 
The first thing you need to decide is whether

you plan to do your investing from a taxable

Chunk 2051 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
you plan to do your investing from a taxable 
account or a retirement account. When you buy and sell stocks in a taxable account, you will need to pay attention to rules on capital gains and losses. For instance, if you sell a stock for a profit inside a taxable account, you may need to pay tax on that gain. However, if you trade from inside a retirement account, such as an individual retirement account or IRA, you may defer your gains when you sell winning stocks.

Chunk 2052 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
You’ll also want to make sure you take the 
time to fully investigate what kind of broker-age firm is right for you. Some brokerage firms charge rock-bottom commissions, but you’re completely on your own when it comes to han-dling your accounts. Other firms charge more for commissions, but provide you access to branch offices and financial advisers, if that’s something you’re interested in.

Protect You from Every Fraud
There’s no question fundamental analysis is one of your biggest shields from

Chunk 2054 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
getting sucked into the next Enron or Sunbeam accounting scandal. As you discovered throughout this book, there are tricks and techniques to funda-mental analysis that help you spot suspicious activity going on at a company. And while you may not be able to pinpoint the specifics of a fraud using a company’s financial statement, you’ll probably see enough red flags to make you suspicious of the company and the way it operates.

Chunk 2055 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
With that said, fundamental analysts must accept, to a certain degree, the 
fact they must take financial statements somewhat at their face value. If a company completely fabricates the numbers on the financial statements while the board of directors and auditing firm aren’t paying attention, there’s only so much a fundamental analyst can do. 
Easily Diversify Your Risk 
over Many Investments
Given the costs of fundamental analysis, discussed above, generally you will

Chunk 2056 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
need to focus your efforts on a few stocks. It’s true that even fundamental analysts have tools that allow them to scan many companies. For instance, you can sift through thousands of companies’ fundamentals using computer-
ized stock-screening tools, as described in Chapter 17.
But generally speaking, if you’re going to go to the trouble and expense of dig-

Chunk 2057 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
ging into the bowels of individual companies, you will likely only be able to keep up with so many stocks. In fact, if you own too many stocks, you might miss some important fundamental details and derail your success. 
Being concentrated in a few stocks, though, presents risks, too. A big and

Chunk 2058 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
unexpected decline in revenue or earnings at one of the companies you’re invested in could depth-charge your returns. Worse yet, a massive decline by one of your holdings might make a dent in your portfolio that will be difficult to overcome. 
Predict the Future
Fundamentals can be poor indicators of the future. Financial statements are backward-looking, meaning they tell you how a company did in the past, not necessarily how it will do in the future.

Chunk 2059 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):

The easiest way to understand the lagging nature of fundamentals is by 
studying the collective earnings of the companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500. Fundamental analysis rarely signals a recovery in stock values or the economy. In fact, fundamentals continue to deteriorate for an average of five months even after the stock market bottoms, according to S&P data.

Chunk 2060 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Rewind back to October 11, 1990. Stocks had been falling for more than a 
month in what had been a nearly 20% pullback. October 11, 1990, though, was the market’s bottom and the beginning of a powerful rally. But you wouldn’t have known it by looking at the fundamentals. Companies’ reported earnings would remain weak for another 15 months after October 1990. Investors who waited for the fundamentals to improve before getting back into the stock market would have missed a powerful bull market.

Chunk 2061 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Fundamentals, though, can sometimes be decent predictors. During the bear 
market that ended in October 2002, companies’ earnings actually started to heal nine months ahead of the stock market’s bottom, S&P says. This was a pretty unusual occurrence, though. Companies’ fundamentals have been poor predictors of market and economic recoveries in eight of the past 10 down-turns, S&P says.

Make You the Next Warren Buffett
Giving the success Warren Buffett has enjoyed at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, it’s natural to want to take a page from his playbook. And clearly, Buffett is a master at using fundamental analysis to identify businesses that generate strong returns over the long term. There are many things to be learned from Buffett’s long-term and patient approach. 
But don’t assume that just by reading about fundamental analysis, you can

Chunk 2063 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
expect to have the same kind of success. Remember, Buffett has an army of analysts to assist him in studying companies. Also, know Buffett’s cache allows him to get deals on stocks you, as an individual investor, would never get. For instance, in 2008, General Electric gave Buffett the opportunity to invest $3 billion in the company and get preferred shares generating 10% annual returns. If only you and I could be so lucky.

The discipline of fundamental analysis can keep you relatively level-headed when it comes to your investing. Instead of blindly following stock tips from a neighbor or from a guru on TV, fundamental analysts take the time to do

their own due diligence. By scanning through a company’s financials, you can

Chunk 2065 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
get a pretty decent idea of a company’s intrinsic value and how healthy the company is. 
And because fundamental analysis is rooted in business and mathematics, 
it portrays a sense of precision. After all, some of the formulas in this book might look like something Einstein scrawled on a blackboard. How could those lead you astray?
 There’s still a healthy dose of judgment and estimation that goes into funda-
mental analysis.

Chunk 2066 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
mental analysis. 
In trend analysis, for instance, it’s up to you to determine whether or not an 
interruption in a company’s long-term earnings track record is a major shift or just a short-term blip. And when it comes to valuation, including using the 
discounted cash flow analysis, the answer you get largely depends on assump-tions that you make. 
Some may say the fact that fundamental analysis allows for human judgment

Chunk 2067 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
makes it more flexible than some sort of computer program that spits out a generic opinion on a stock. That’s true. But it’s also important to keep in mind that your own biases can work their way into your fundamental analysis.

to pad their imaginary stock-picking track records. You might, for instance, accurately forecast a company’s future earnings, which is pretty difficult to do.

How to measure your portfolio’s return

Chunk 2072 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
How to measure your portfolio’s return
Measuring your portfolio’s return is pretty straightforward. Assuming you didn’t add any fresh cash to the account during the year, simply subtract your portfolio’s value at the end of the year from its value at the start of the year. Divide that difference by your portfolio’s value at the beginning of the year and multiply by 100, and voila, that’s your percentage gain for the year. Table 22-1 provides a simple example of returns.

Chunk 2073 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Table 22-1 Here’s a Sample Portfolio
Quarter ended Portfolio value
December 2008 $10,000
March 2009 $10,050
June 2009 $10,500
September 2009 $10,501
December 2009 $11,000
Using Table 22-1, you would measure your portfolio’s return this way: 
($11,000 – $10,000) / $10,000 = 0.10. Multiply by 100 to convert the answer 
into a percentage, or 10%. That is your annual return.
 Be sure to compare the return of your portfolio to that of the Standard &

Poor’s 500 or another stock market index to find out if you’re beating, or get-ting beaten by, the market. 
How to measure your portfolio’s risk
Putting a number on your portfolio’s risk is a little trickier than measuring your return. You’ll need to figure out how volatile your returns are using a statistical measure called standard deviation. 
To calculate your portfolio’s standard deviation, you will first need to tabulate

Chunk 2075 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
the percentage changes for each period. You can do this analysis based on any 
30 506455-ch22.indd   34030 506455-ch22.indd   340 9/24/09   10:44:21 PM9/24/09   10:44:21 PM341  Chapter 22: Ten Things Fundamental Analysis Can’t Do
period of time, but since Table 22-1 is quarterly, you can practice with that. You 
just use the formula above and calculate the returns for each quarter. When you’re done, you’ll see a table that looks like what you see in Table 22-2.

Chunk 2076 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Table 22-2 Sample Portfolio of Returns
Quarter ended Return
March 2009 0.5%
June 2009 4.5%
September 2009 0.01%
December 2009 4.8%
Lastly, you’ll need to calculate the standard deviation. If you want to under-stand the gory details of standard deviation and how to calculate it by hand, check out Statistics For Dummies (Wiley). 
Otherwise, you’ll want to enter the row and columns into Microsoft Excel just

Chunk 2077 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
as you see it in Table 22-2. You can then use the “=stdev” function. For more help on ways to use your computer to calculate standard deviation, espe-cially when returns are negative, that’s also covered in Investing Online For Dummies (Wiley). 
 If you have an HP 12C financial calculator, you can enter each return followed

Chunk 2078 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
by the Sigma + key. When you’re done entering all the returns, press the g key and the s key to see your portfolio’s quarterly standard deviation. The answer you get is 2.55 percentage points. 
You’re almost done. You must now convert the quarterly standard deviation

Chunk 2079 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
into an annualized number. You do that by multiplying the period’s standard deviation by the square root of the number of periods in a year. Yikes, I know. But in this case, since you are measuring quarterly standard deviation, there are four quarters in a year. That means you take the square root of 4, which is 2. So to convert your quarterly standard deviation to an annualized figure, just multiply the 2.55 standard deviation by 2.

Chunk 2080 (Source: Fundamental-Analysis-for-Dummies-PDFdrive.txt):
Sizing up your portfolio’s risk and return
Just knowing your portfolio’s return and risk doesn’t tell you much. It’s important to compare those data with a benchmark, or a set of investments that you want to size yourself up against. The IFA Risk and Return Calculator (www.ifa.com/portfolios/PortReturnCalc/index.aspx ) lets you

see the returns and standard deviations of several measures of stocks to see

Be careful of drawing too much from just one year. Don’t assume that if you 
had one good year your luck will continue. 
If all these measurements just give you a headache, but you still want to

colleagues and family members.
First and foremost, I would like to thank my
loving parents for their support throughout
my life. They are primarily responsible for
cultivating patience and perseverance in me,
without which a trader has no chance of
success. I am also grateful for the wonderful
support and love from my sister and her
family. Special thanks go to my in-laws,

especially my father-in-law, who was
instrumental in providing me a lot of data onthe Indian markets. He has been actively
involved in stock trading and his experience
has been a blessing for me.
I am delighted to take this opportunity to
thank my mentor and a superb fellow trader,
Hugh Terry. Hugh introduced me to
candlesticks and his lessons have been
invaluable to me. There are very few people
in this world who selflessly share their
knowledge and experience with others. Hugh
is one of them.

I would also like to thank folks at Icharts
(www.ichart.com) for allowing me use of
their stock charts. The team of Icharts has
done an excellent job in making available
technical charting to the Indian marketplayers. I am also thankful for all the good
suggestions from members and students of

in my efforts and publishing this book.

Introduction
The Japanese art of candlestick trading has
been around for nearly four centuries.
Japanese rice traders successfully used these
signal formations to amass huge fortunes.
Since then, the signals have been refined,

Chunk 2211 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Since then, the signals have been refined,
tested and utilized in a variety of markets.
Wherever an instrument can be traded in an
open market by traders, candlestick signals
can be used to profit in such markets.
Candlestick signals depict change in investor
psychology. They visually show a trader thesentiments of the other traders in that
particular stock or market. It does not matter
if the signals are applied to commodities,
stocks or futures. Candlestick signals work

Chunk 2212 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
stocks or futures. Candlestick signals work
with all of them. It does not matter whether
the market is the Nasdaq, the Nikkei, the
German DAX or the Nifty. All of these
markets can be analyzed and traded using
candlestick charting.
Why do people around the world pour their
hard earned money into the financial
markets? Why do they not keep their money
invested in fixed price no risk certificates?
The answer is obvious. They take the risk of
investing in stock, currency and futures

Chunk 2213 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
investing in stock, currency and futures
markets in order to get higher returns on their
money. The allure of hitting it big in the stockmarket keeps their dream of financial
independence alive. They look for a good
nest egg to be built from the gains in the
market for a comfortable retirement.
Yet the percentage of investors that actively
manages its portfolios is paltry compared to
those who keep pouring money in the market
hoping they would strike gold someday.

Chunk 2214 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
hoping they would strike gold someday.
(Henceforth we will use the terms “market”
and “stock market” to include the stock,
commodity and the currency markets.)
Ask yourself which category you fit in from
among the following:
You listen to analysts on TV to get
recommendations for buying stocks.You subscribe to a stock picking service
for your stock investments.
You try out the latest stock picking
software, lose money and start all over
again.
You get your stock investment ideas from

Chunk 2215 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
again.
You get your stock investment ideas from
your friends, your colleagues or the local
tea vendor.
You have tried all of the above, lost
money and given up on the stock market
altogether.
If you have done any of the above, you are
not alone. Most investors are the same
everywhere. They keep searching for the one
golden technique that will work each andevery time they put their money in the
markets. They do not spend enough time to
independently study the market itself. They

Chunk 2216 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
independently study the market itself. They
tend to believe that analysts on TV, who do
all the research and generously offer their
recommendations are motivated by the idea
of making you rich! That is being very naïve,
indeed.
Most traditional investors believe in a “buy
and hold” strategy. They believe in
“averaging down” a stock. Their thinking is
limited to “It will go up one day”. They will
argue against timing the market. These are
the people who spend more time thinking

Chunk 2217 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
the people who spend more time thinking
about what clothes to wear to office on any
day, than they do about their investments and
their financial future.Part of this stems from the fact that real-time
access to market data was very limited till
just a few years ago. People used to be able
to look at their investments only at the end of
the day. Trading costs, i.e. buying and selling
commissions, were also very high. But those
factors are no longer valid. Information

Chunk 2218 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
factors are no longer valid. Information
technology has changed the trading scenario.
More and more people are now opening
online trading accounts. They now have
access to real-time instantaneous data.
Technology has also helped to drive down
trading costs considerably.
As the BSE and NSE equity indices rally
because of underlying strong growth
fundamentals of India, individual investors
would naturally want to increasinglyparticipate in the markets. It is extremely

Chunk 2219 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
important that these investors and traders
educate themselves in learning the language
of the markets. The markets speak in subtle
ways. They are always giving clues to their
directional movements. Candlestick trading
is all about reading this subtle language of
the markets.
There are more than fifty candlestick signals
defined by Japanese traders. However, of
these we will focus on the most common
ones. You will find that these major
candlestick signals occur often and

Chunk 2220 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
candlestick signals occur often and
repeatedly. Your time as a trader or investor
will be well spent if you understand these
major signal formations.There have been a handful of books written
on candlestick charting so far. Most of these
books have been written from the
perspective of trading the US markets. This
book is specifically written with the Indian
trader in mind. All the included charts are of
companies trading on either the National
Stock Exchange or the Bombay Stock
Exchange.

Chunk 2221 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Stock Exchange or the Bombay Stock
Exchange.
By the end of this book you will be able to
look at any chart and analyze it yourself. You
will be able to turn off the analysts on TV
and unsubscribe your stock picking service.
You will discover within you the ability to
diagnose the health of the market. That
ability will bring with it the confidence to
enter high probability big profit situationswhich will, in turn, help your portfolio grow
rapidly. However, let me warn you. This is

Chunk 2222 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
rapidly. However, let me warn you. This is
not a “get-rich-quick-scheme” book. It will
not turn you into an overnight crorepati. The
intention of this book is to teach you how to
use these powerful candlestick techniques
correctly and effectively. Wealth generation
will automatically follow!
The next chapter will go into detail about the
construction of candlesticks and more
importantly the psychology underlying those
candlesticks.2

Candlestick Trading: The
Basics
This chapter is not going to be an essay on
the science of psychology — though it would
be very interesting to know what reputed
psychologists like Carl Jung and Freud
would think about the art of trading! This
chapter will hopefully link in your mind the
importance of psychological underpinnings
of trading stocks.
If someone were to ask me what percentageof trading is comprised of psychological
warfare, I would put the number between

Chunk 2224 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
warfare, I would put the number between
85% and 95%. The stock market is
essentially a game of fear and greed. Supply
and demand are by-products of these two
emotions battling it out for dominance in the
market.Fear and Greed
Fear creates panic. And panic creates supply
in the marketplace.
Greed produces exuberance, giving rise to
demand.
As humans, we cannot escape these two
emotions while trying to make money in the

Chunk 2225 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
When you watch a stock you own go down,
you get overwhelmed by fear and anxiety.
Such emotions create havoc in the mind:
How low will the stock go and how
much will I lose?What if my spouse / parents / friends find
out about this pathetic losing trade I
made?
Should I get out now?
What if the stock turns around as soon as
I sell it? How much of a fool would I be
then? And on and on and on.Notice the Fear

stock you don’t own, but wanted to own,

Should I buy it now? If I don’t, and it
goes up even more, what a fool I’ll then
be.
This is the stock to own, let me get in
now.
Everybody I know owns this one, I have
to buy it and ride it up. And, on and on.Notice the Greed

please browse through the self-help section

The fact is that experienced and successful
traders know that they cannot master these
two emotions. They know that all profits will
evaporate into thin air if they fall in the trap
of trying to master them. What they do,

This is where candlestick signals assert their
dominance.
Candlestick signals, by the very nature of
how they are constructed, point out the
messages of the market. These signals have

They would not have been around for this
long if they wouldn’t have had strong
underlying market logic.
These signals depict the outcome of all the
cumulative knowledge of the traders and
investors playing that stock. Stock priceshave little to do with the actual fundamentals
of a company. Instead, they have a lot more
to do with the company’s “perceived”
fundamentals. It does not matter what a
company has achieved till date. If the

company has achieved till date. If the
perceived growth of the company is doubtful,
then the stock has little or no chance of
appreciation. What would you rather be
buying? A good, well known company but
with little perceived growth or a company
which traders and investors believe will
grow for the next few years. I would buy the
latter. This is what makes the stock market so
dynamic. The fear of losing money and the
greed for making more money creates the

let it be this — as a trader, you should
always be buying into other’s fears and

And this is not as complex as it sounds. Once

principle. You can either be a shark in the
ocean or be eaten by one!Candlesticks Light the Way
Let us now look at how candlesticks are
drawn.
You need four price points to draw a single
candlestick. Considering an example of a
daily candlestick, you need:
High price of the day;
Low price of the day;
Opening price of the day;
Closing price of the day.

Chunk 2233 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Closing price of the day.
The two parts of the candlestick are:
The body: This is the part between theopen and the close. In case the day’s
opening price is lower than the closing
price, the colour of the body is white
(some charting services will make this
green). Conversely, when the day’s
opening price is higher than the closing
price, the colour of the body is black
(sometimes shown as red).
The shadows: The upper shadow is the
line above the body and the lower

Chunk 2234 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
line above the body and the lower
shadow is the line below the body. In the
case of a black bodied candle, the upper
shadow is from the day’s open price to
its high price and the lower shadow is
from the closing price to the low price of
that day. Conversely, in the case of a
white bodied candle, the upper shadowis between the closing price and the high
price of the day, and the lower shadow is
between the opening price and the low
price of the day.
Note: Throughout this book, the words

Chunk 2235 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Note: Throughout this book, the words
“white” candle and “light” candle have been
used interchangeably. Also, the words “black”
candle and “dark” candle have been used
interchangeably.
Figure 2.1 shows the construction of a
candlestick when the closing price of the day
is higher than the opening price of the day.Figure 2.1: White (green) candlestick
depicts that the day’s closing price was
higher than the opening price of the day
Figure 2.2 shows a candlestick where the

Figure 2.2 shows a candlestick where the
closing price of the day is lower than the
opening price of the day.Figure 2.2: Black (red) candlestick depicts
that the day’s closing price was lower than
the opening price of the day
It is not necessary for a candle to have both
the upper and lower shadows. The following
figures depict a few variations of the candle
formation. The reader does not need to
remember the names but should understand
the formation instead.White Morubozu

Chunk 2237 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
the formation instead.White Morubozu
This is a white candle with no shadows at
either end (see Figure 2.3).
Figure 2.3: White Morubozu
It depicts a day when the low of the day is
the same as the open and the high of the day
is the same as the close price of the day. This
usually represents a very bullish formation
as it shows the bulls had the upper handthroughout the day.Black Morubozu
This is a black candle with no shadows at
either end (see Figure 2.4).
Figure 2.4: Black Morubozu

Chunk 2238 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Figure 2.4: Black Morubozu
This occurs when the high of the day is the
same as the open price of the day and the
close of the day is the same as the low priceof the day. What does this candle represent?
It shows domination by the bears throughout
the day. Generally, this would be considered
a very bearish candle.Opening Morubozu
Figure 2.5 shows two cases of an Opening
Morubozu.
Figure 2.5: Opening Morubozu
As you can see, they do not have a shadow
attached to their opening price end of the

Chunk 2239 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
attached to their opening price end of the
body. The white candle denotes that bullstook control right from the start while the
black candle suggests that the bears
dominated right from the open.Closing Morubozu
As can be seen from Figure 2.6, the Closing
Morubozu does not have a tail attached to the
closing price end of the body.
Figure 2.6: Closing Morubozu
The white candle implies that the bulls tookover control during the day and ended the
day strong. On the other hand, the black

Chunk 2240 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
day strong. On the other hand, the black
candle suggests that the bears took over
during the day and forced the price to close
at the lowest level of the day.Doji
The Doji is one of the most important
candlestick formations. Chapter 3 will
discuss this signal in detail. For now, we
will define the Doji as a candle where the
opening and closing prices are the same.
Figure 2.7 shows a Doji candle.
Figure 2.7: DojiPlease note that given how candlesticks
are constructed, it is very much possible to

Chunk 2241 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
are constructed, it is very much possible to
have a dark candle even when the price
closes higher compared to the previous
day. Similarly, you can have a white candle
form even if prices close down for the day.
Each candle is independent of the previous
day’s candle. This is a very important
point and you need to make sure you
understand this concept clearly.
The following examples will help clarify the
point:
Let us assume for company XYZ, the
share price closes at ` 50 today. If the

Chunk 2242 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
share price closes at ` 50 today. If the
price opens at ` 55 tomorrow, but closes
at ` 53, what colour candle will you seeon the chart? You will see a dark candle.
This is because while the price closed
higher (` 53) than it did the day before (`
50) but it closed below the day’s open (`
55), creating the dark candle.
Consider the company XYZ again with a
closing price of ` 50 for today. If the
price opens at ` 45 tomorrow and closes
at ` 48, you will see a white candle on

Chunk 2243 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
at ` 48, you will see a white candle on
the candlestick chart. This is because the
day’s price closed higher (` 48) than its
opening price (` 45). The fact that it
closed below ` 50 (closing price of the
previous day) does not matter in the
construction of the candle.
This is the key powerful concept behindcandlestick charting. The construction
conveys a wealth of information to the
candlestick trader, which a regular line chart
reader would have no access to.

Chunk 2244 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
reader would have no access to.
To illustrate this point and show the inherent
power of candlesticks, we will compare
Figure 2.8 with Figure 2.9. Both are charts of
Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. for the same
time period.
Figure 2.8: Candlestick chart of Bharat
Heavy Electricals Ltd.
Figure 2.9: Line chart of Bharat Heavy
Electricals Ltd.
Can you visually see the vast difference in
the two charts? Here are some things which
can be easily observed:
Point A in the two charts shows a key

Chunk 2245 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Point A in the two charts shows a key
reversal for the share. What would havealerted a line chart trader to this reversal
(Figure 2.9)? Nothing. In the case of a
candlestick trader, a candlestick buy
formation would have been seen on Chart
2.8 and the trader could have acted on it.
Point B does not even exist in the line
chart (Figure 2.9). That is because a line
chart uses only closing prices. The
candlestick chart trader would have been
way ahead of the competition in this

Chunk 2246 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
way ahead of the competition in this
case. It is easily seen from the chart
(Figure 2.8) that prices failed precisely
at the resistance level established in
early December. The supply at price
point B well exceeds the demand. The
candlestick trader could have used this
knowledge to go short.Point C in the line chart shows
oscillatory behaviour at an earlier
resistance level (Figure 2.9). However,
the strength of the stock cannot be
gleaned from the chart. Is it going to

Chunk 2247 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
gleaned from the chart. Is it going to
break the resistance and go higher or
succumb to selling pressure? What do the
probabilities say? The answer is
uncertain at best. However, in the
candlestick chart (Figure 2.8), one can
easily observe the Doji and Spinning
Tops (explained later) confirming
resistance. The probabilities favoured
the bears.
To give an analogy, say a patient with a
broken bone walks into a doctor’s clinic.

Chunk 2248 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
broken bone walks into a doctor’s clinic.
The doctor can feel the affected area and tryto gauge the damage. But he cannot know
what is going on internally. He needs an x-
ray machine to visually show him the exact
location and extent of the damage.
Candlesticks perform the function of the
x-ray machine. They visually show you the
internal dynamics of the market. A simple
analysis of the candlestick chart would then
catapult you way ahead of your competition.Why Bother with Bar Charts?

Chunk 2249 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
We could also compare bar charts with
candle charts and come to almost the same
conclusion. The candlestick chart
incorporates everything that a bar chart does.
In addition, it is visually more revealing. The
black (red) and white (green) colour bodies
make analyzing a candlestick chart much
easier and more intuitive. Once you start
looking at candlestick charts, other charting
techniques seem dull and arcane. By the end
of this book, you should be able to analyze

of this book, you should be able to analyze
any candlestick chart within a minute. That is
my goal.Stochastics
This book is written to help the reader
maximize his or her investment or trading
potential. One key ingredient of this strategy
is to minimize downside risk. For this
purpose, we will look for highly profitable
buy trades in oversold conditions and
highly profitable sell trades in overbought
conditions. To find out when the shares are
overbought or oversold, we need an

Chunk 2251 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
overbought or oversold, we need an
oscillator. I have always used the stochastics
oscillator for this purpose. It is a matter of
personal preference and the reader can
choose any other indicator he or she is
familiar with.
Note: For those readers who are unfamiliarwith technical indicators and oscillators, I
would recommend reading some of the
technical analysis books mentioned in the
Bibliography section of this book.
Note: The candlestick trader need not go into

Chunk 2252 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Note: The candlestick trader need not go into
details of the stochastics indicator. It is
described here for educational reading only.
The stochastic oscillator comprises of two
lines: %K, or the raw stochastics, and %D,
which is a moving average of the smoothed
version of %K.
The following formula is used to calculate
%K:
%K = (C – L) / (H – L) * 100Where,
C = Closing price.
L = Lowest price in last N days.
H = Highest price in last N days.
%K gives you a percentage between 0 and

Chunk 2253 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
%K gives you a percentage between 0 and
100. From this formula, it can be seen that if
the stock is closing at the highest level in N
days, %K will be 100. This %K is generally
very volatile and hence is often smoothed out
over a certain number of days. This gives a
much smoother line than %K itself. %D is
the moving average over a certain number of
days of this smooth version of %K.
In short, stochastics give you the relative

Chunk 2254 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
In short, stochastics give you the relative
position of the price as compared to therange of the past N trading days. If the
price closes towards the high end of the
period, then the stochastics will be closer to
100. If the price closes towards the lower
end of the range in that time period, then the
stochastics will be a number closer to 0. In
general, any reading above 80 for the
stochastics indicates an overbought
condition. Any reading below 20 suggests

Chunk 2255 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
condition. Any reading below 20 suggests
that the shares are currently oversold.
The stochastics indicator can be plotted by
most of the charting software found online.
A question often arises as to what settings
should be used to display the stochastics. In
other words, what is the value of “N”
mentioned above? I usually use a value of12. Some traders use 14. The smaller the
time period you choose, the more volatile the
indicator will be. So, if you want to get rapid

Chunk 2256 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
indicator will be. So, if you want to get rapid
buy and sell signals, you would choose, say,
5. For swing trading, where you hold a
position for a few days to a few weeks, you
could choose 12 or 14. The correct
procedure to get this number is by trial and
error. Your goal is to see where the price
reversed in the past and the corresponding
stochastic setting. Those need to match up.
The reversal from a high needs to match with
stochastics in overbought conditions while

Chunk 2257 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
stochastics in overbought conditions while
the reversal from the bottom needs to match
with oversold conditions of stochastics.
The other parameter you put in is the number
of days to smooth out the %K. Generally, 3days works very well. But you are free to
experiment with other numbers.
It is vital to emphasize at this point that
the use of any indicator is secondary in
nature. The candlestick signals are the
primary source for decision making.
The key is to find candlestick buy signals in

Chunk 2258 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
The key is to find candlestick buy signals in
oversold conditions and candlestick sell
signals in overbought conditions. As you
read the following chapters, you will notice
that most of the charts will focus on the
overbought-oversold conditions. For the
beginner candlestick trader, these situations
will be plentiful to take advantage of. They
will enhance your confidence level while

explanation of the major candlestick signals.
The nuances associated with individual
signal formations are explained along with
plenty of charts. Sometimes, you will see the
important points being repeated in many
places. Believe me, it will add to your
mental reinforcement of the psychology of
the signals. The goal here is to get your eyes

formations is of the utmost importance if you
want to successfully trade with them.3
The Doji
The Doji is one of the most important
candlestick signals. The Japanese say that
whenever you see a Doji, pay heed.Doji
Description
Figure 3.1 shows a Doji formation. Notice
that the open and the close of the stock are at
about the same price.
Figure 3.1: Doji signalCriteria
For the Doji to be valid, the following
conditions need to be met:
The open and the close of the stock must

Chunk 2262 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
The open and the close of the stock must
be almost at the same price level.
There can be an upper shadow or a
lower shadow, or both.
Figure 3.2 shows a few Doji variations:Figure 3.2: Doji variations
When the Doji does not have a lower
shadow, it is termed a Gravestone
Doji. The Japanese compare it to the
soldiers going out to battle during the day
and coming back to their original
positions for rest during the night. This
type of Doji formation is very

Chunk 2263 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
type of Doji formation is very
effective at the top of a trend. Thelogic being that though the bulls tried to
rally the stock they failed at the end of
the day.
A Doji without any upper shadow is
known as a Dragonfly Doji, just
because it looks like one. This kind of
Doji would have powerful implications
near the bottom of the trend. It implies
that while the bears tried to take the price
down during the day, by the end the bulls
were able to bring the price back to
where it had opened.

Chunk 2264 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
where it had opened.
When the Doji has a small body, it is
also known as a Spinning Top.
Note: These names are mentioned here onlyfor information purposes. As a candlestick
trader, these names are irrelevant. The
analysis of the formation is critical. That
analysis will decide your survival in the
marketplace!
A Doji can be found anywhere in the trend.
The significance of the Doji varies according
to its position in the trend. A simple analysis
of Figure 3.1 indicates that the bulls tried to

Chunk 2265 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
of Figure 3.1 indicates that the bulls tried to
drive the prices higher and failed. The bears
tried to run prices lower and failed. So there
is now equilibrium in demand and supply.
Both sides of the equation balance out each
other. The candlestick trader can use this
battle impasse very profitably.
We will now analyze the Doji in variousscenarios.
Doji After a Stock is in an Overbought
Condition
The Japanese say that whenever you see a
Doji at the top, be prepared to sell. Consider

Chunk 2266 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Doji at the top, be prepared to sell. Consider
a stock moving up in a trend. The bulls are
happy with the white candles increasing their
net worth. Then, one day, the candle forms a
Doji. The bulls were running unchecked till
now. Now the bears are starting to fight
back. They are fighting back to the point
where the bulls are not able to move the
price much higher from the open. This gives
rise to the Doji formation. The bulls are now
tired. The bears sense this. If the price opens

Chunk 2267 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
tired. The bears sense this. If the price opens
lower the next day, there is high probabilitythat the bulls have given in and the trend has
reversed for a while.
Doji After a Stock is in an Oversold
Condition
Now consider a stock that has been moving
down for a while. The bears are happy. The
black candles visually demonstrate their hold
on the stock. Then, one day, the bulls step in.
They fight the bears and finally the dayends
as a Doji. What does this do to the bears’

Chunk 2268 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
as a Doji. What does this do to the bears’
sentiment? They get nervous. They know they
are tired. If the next day the price stays
firmly positive, the bears move away. The
trend reverses as the bulls get more
confident.
Doji in a Sideways MarketConsider a stock moving sideways for a
period of time. The bulls and bears are
fighting it out. Then one day you notice a nice
big Doji. This is where things get interesting.
You now know that an equilibrium has been

Chunk 2269 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
You now know that an equilibrium has been
achieved. What you want to see now is a gap
up or gap down scenario the next day. This
indicates high probability that a trend will
start in the direction of the gap. The reason
being, after the Doji (say in your mind
indecision), the traders have made up their
mind as to the stronger force between the
bulls and the bears. As a candlestick trader,
you can now enter this market to ride the new
trend.
The following conditions enhance the

Chunk 2270 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
trend.
The following conditions enhance the
probability of reversal:Stochastics in oversold or overbought
conditions.
Heavy volume on the Doji day.
Long upper and lower shadows implying
great indecision at the point.
A gap up or gap down open the next day.
Figure 3.3 shows a Doji stopping the
downtrend in Pfizer stock. You will notice
that Pfizer was already in an oversold
condition as indicated by the stochastics
position. What happened the day after the

Chunk 2271 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
position. What happened the day after the
Doji? A gap up bullish candle!Figure 3.3: Doji at key reversal levels in
Pfizer
The Doji told the candlestick trader to keep a
close watch. It indicated that the sellers, who
were so dominant till this point, were being
challenged by the bulls. There is indecision
in the market. There is, therefore, a goodprobability that the trend reversal is near.

the top warrants immediate selling, but a
Doji at the bottom of a trend needs
confirmation of strength from the bulls.
This is because the weight of the market can
still drag the stock down if the bulls are not
forceful enough. Hence, one needs to wait to
see strength in the markets after a Doji type
day.
What better way to see strength then a gap up

going short after confirmation (yes, I wait for

The third arrow on the chart (Point C) shows
a spinning top and a Doji stopped the
pullback.
Figure 3.5 shows a chart of Hindalco. Notice
the arrows showing quite a few Doji. This is

Doji in Hindalco
The first two Doji did not have any
confirmation selling following them. What
can be inferred from that? It shows that after
the up trend, the bulls merely rested. The day
of indecision was followed by more buying,
implying strength in the up trend. However,after the third Doji the bears assumed control
of the stock as seen by the big dark candle.
There was no doubt after seeing this candle
that the bulls had lost the battle.

Hammer and Hanging Man
Signals
The Hammer and the Hanging Man are one-
day reversal signals. Traders should gear up

day reversal signals. Traders should gear up

confirmed the following day.
Hammer
Description
Figure 4.1 shows a Hammer formation. As
can be seen, an ideal Hammer has a small
body and a tail which is at least twice the
size of the candle’s body.
Figure 4.1: Hammer signalCriteria
In order for the Hammer signal to be valid,
the following conditions must exist:
The price must have been in a definite
downtrend before this signal occurs. This

Chunk 2279 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
downtrend before this signal occurs. This
can be visually seen on the chart.
The lower shadow must be at least twice
the size of the body.
The day after the Hammer is formed, one
should witness continued buying.
There should be no upper shadow or a
very small upper shadow. The colour of
the body does not matter, but a white
body would be more positive than ablack body.
Why the Reversal Works
Consider a stock moving down for a period
of time. Investors start panicking at some

Chunk 2280 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
of time. Investors start panicking at some
point. They want to get out and accept the
loss. Finally, as the sellers pile on the stock
starts selling off heavily during the day. But
then smart money moves in. They are able to
move the price all the way near where the
stock had opened for that day. This gives the
stock a hammer look. The Japanese call it
hammering out a bottom. However, the
stock needs to trade higher the next day to
confirm that the bulls have actually reversed

Chunk 2281 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
confirm that the bulls have actually reversed
the trend. The candlestick trader should enter
the market after seeing this confirmation.The following conditions can make the
Hammer signal a more compelling buy:
There is a gap down from the previous
day’s close on the day of the Hammer.
There is a spike in volume on the
Hammer day.
Stochastics are in oversold condition.
The longer the lower shadow, the better.
Figure 4.2 shows the chart of Bharat Forge
Co. Ltd. Notice the long-legged Hammer in

Chunk 2282 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Co. Ltd. Notice the long-legged Hammer in
June 2006. The volume surged on the day of
the Hammer, indicating people were panic
selling the shares. The question is — who
was buying when these “novice” traders
were selling?Figure 4.2: A Hammer in oversold
condition in Bharat Forge
Also note the fact that the stochastics were
near the oversold area. Another point to see
in the chart is the day before the Hammer
signal. That candle also had a long tail,

Chunk 2283 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
signal. That candle also had a long tail,
indicating buyers stepping in to absorb someof the selling. But it did not form the Hammer
signal because the lower shadow was not
twice the length of the body.
Consider Figure 4.3 showing the Hammer
formation in Punjab National Bank chart. If
you watch closely, the Hammer has a small
upper shadow. That is acceptable. Compared
to the size of the lower shadow, the upper
shadow is negligible. The stochastics are in

Chunk 2284 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
shadow is negligible. The stochastics are in
the right place adding credence to the signal.
Buying around the ` 430 area after
confirmation and selling around the ` 470
area (after the Bearish Engulfing signal)
would have given the candlestick trader
good profits.Figure 4.3: Punjab National Bank rallying
after a Hammer
Figure 4.4 shows a Hammer signal in Biocon
Limited. Notice the stochastics were not in
the oversold region, but were moving up.
This was due to the price steadying around

Chunk 2285 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
This was due to the price steadying around
the ` 330 area. What can be deduced fromthis chart is that the investors lost patience
with the stock. After weeks of downtrend,
and then no movement at all, the investors
finally gave up. That was the time smart
money moved in and generated the classic
Hammer signal. Strong profits would have
been generated for a trader buying on
confirmation of this signal.Figure 4.4: A Hammer and volume
explosion in Biocon

Chunk 2286 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
What do the candlesticks in Figure 4.5 show
you? Can you see any sign before the actual
Hammer signal that should have alerted you
that the downtrend might be approaching its
end? The big black candle the day before theHammer in oversold condition shows you
visually the panic selling as a result of the
fear experienced by novice traders.

Description
Figure 4.7 shows a visual depiction of the
Hanging Man signal. No, I have not copied
the image from Figure 4.1 showing the

exactly the same, but the position of the

Chunk 2289 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Hammer comes after a downtrend and the
Hanging Man comes after an up trend.Figure 4.7: Hanging Man signalCriteria
The conditions for the Hanging Man signal to
be valid are:
The stock must have been in a definite up
trend before this signal occurs. This can
be visually verified on the chart.
The lower shadow must be at least twice
the size of the body.
The day after the Hanging Man signal
should witness continued selling and a
lower close.
There should be no upper shadow or a

Chunk 2290 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
lower close.
There should be no upper shadow or a
very small upper shadow.Why the Reversal Works
Consider a stock in an up trend. Investors
and traders are happy that their portfolios are
showing green. Then, one day, big money
decides to take profits. They start selling the
stock. Novice traders, who have seen the
stock rise for the past numerous sessions, see
this dip as a buying opportunity. They start
absorbing the supply and are finally able to

Chunk 2291 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
absorbing the supply and are finally able to
take the price up towards the top of the day’s
trading range. However, the bulls are now
getting nervous. Their confidence in the stock
is dropping. Their greed is turning into fear
— fear of losing their hard earned profits. If
the stock closes lower the next day
confirming their fears, the downtrend will
accelerate from that point on. The bears willtake control.
The following conditions make the reversal
of the up trend more convincing:

Chunk 2292 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
of the up trend more convincing:
There is a spike in volume on the day of
the signal.
There is a gap up from the previous close
on the day of the signal showing
exuberant buying at the top.
Stochastics are in overbought condition.
The longer the lower shadow, the better.
The colour of the Hanging Man body
does not matter, but a black body would
be a stronger confirmation.
Figure 4.8 shows the chart of SatyamComputer Services Ltd. This is an ideal
Hanging Man signal. All the stars have

Chunk 2293 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):

of the trade. Those who are averse to
shorting stocks can at least sell their existing
position and lock-in profits.
Figure 4.8: A Hanging Man in overboughtcondition in Satyam Computer
Firstly, you can see the climactic buying as
shown by the above average volume on the
day before the signal. Secondly, stochastics
are in the overbought area. The day after the
Hanging Man signal, the stock gapped down,

Chunk 2294 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Hanging Man signal, the stock gapped down,
validating the fact that bears had taken
control.
Notice in the chart of Punjab Tractors Ltd. in
Figure 4.9, that the stock gapped up on the
day it formed the Hanging Man signal.Figure 4.9: Hanging Man stops the up
trend in Punjab Tractors
Though it was a relatively small candle, it
satisfied all the requirements of the
formation. Also notice that this signal was
formed at the same area where the stock met

Chunk 2295 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
formed at the same area where the stock met
resistance a few days back. This type ofconfirmation should give a trader a high
degree of confidence that the trend is
reversing.

glean any information as a trader from the
candle the day before the Hanging Man
signal formed?Figure 4.10: Hanging Man confirms

familiar with the Hammer and Hanging Man
signals, think and analyse in your mind the
signal formation day. This will reinforce
your confidence as you will now know the
reasoning behind your trade. Traders can
only be so much successful if they don’t

pull the trigger at the right place and at the
right time.

Inverted Hammer and Shooting
Star Signals
The Inverted Hammer and the Shooting Star
signal also belong to the class of one-day
reversal signals. We will basically flip the
Hammer and the Hanging Man signals upside
down to generate these new signals.Inverted Hammer

Chunk 2298 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Description
Figure 5.1 shows the Inverted Hammer
formation.
Figure 5.1: Inverted Hammer signal
As you can see from the directions of the
arrows, the Inverted Hammer is found near
the bottom of a downtrend.Criteria
In order for the Inverted Hammer signal to be
valid, the following conditions must exist:
The stock must have been in a definite
downtrend before this signal occurs. This
can be visually seen on the chart.
The upper shadow must be at least twice
the size of the length of the body.

Chunk 2299 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
the size of the length of the body.
The day following the Inverted Hammer
should witness continued buying.
There should either be no lower shadow
or a very small lower shadow. The
colour of the body does not matter, but a
white body would be more positive thana black body.
Why the Reversal Works
Imagine a stock in a downtrend. As
portfolios start showing red, there is panic in
the street. People want to get out. That is the
time smart money likes to buy. One day, as

Chunk 2300 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
time smart money likes to buy. One day, as
the stock opens down or flat, the bulls start
stepping in. They drive the price higher
during the day. Eventually, the bears drive it
back down and close it near the open of the
day. The bulls have, however, shown their
presence. They can now sense that the bears
are getting weaker. If the bulls manage to
close the price higher the next day, the
downtrend is considered broken. The key

Chunk 2301 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
downtrend is considered broken. The key
here, as was in the case of the Hammer, isthat the bulls need to show confirmed buying
the next day. Again, the Japanese candlestick
traders have placed emphasis on the fact that
the upper shadow must be at least twice that
of the body size. The colour of the body does
not matter, though a white body would be
ideal. That would demonstrate the bulls
managed to close the price higher than where
the stock had opened up.
The following conditions can make the

Chunk 2302 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
The following conditions can make the
Inverted Hammer signal a more compelling
buy:
There is a gap down from the previous
day’s close on the day the Inverted
Hammer is formed.
There is a spike in volume on theInverted Hammer day.
Stochastics are in oversold condition.
The longer the upper shadow, the more
the dominance shown by the bulls.

Chunk 2303 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
What a perfect visual depiction of panic
selling! The gap down on the day of the
Inverted Hammer in oversold conditions
should immediately alert the trader for a
possible trend reversal. The correct entryprocedure would be to wait for confirmation
of buying the next day, which in this case
was pretty evident.

We witness a gap down Inverted Hammer in
oversold conditions. What should the
candlestick traders do here? They should
wait for confirmation. The next day the
buying was confirmed as shown by the white
candle. The traders are now ready to pull the
trigger. What happens then is very interesting
and worth elaborating. The day after the
confirmation, the price gaps up. Many

Stochastics in oversold conditions and
confirmation buying on the following day, the
market was offering a high probability
reversal scenario to the trader. You can also
notice an Inverted Hammer like formation in
the chart in September. The upper shadow
was not quite twice the body size.
Stochastics were not in oversold conditions
either. It proved to be a good reversal, but
it was not a candlestick signal. The trader

Chunk 2307 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
it was not a candlestick signal. The trader
would be well advised not to chase these
“almost” candlestick formations. There are
hundreds of pure candlestick signals being
formed every day. They have been tested
thoroughly for centuries. Take advantage of
them. Do not unnecessarily put your hardearned money in trying to reinvent the wheel.
We will conclude the Inverted Hammer
discussion with Figure 5.5, showing the chart
of Tata Power Co. Ltd.

reversed? You can see there was a Hammer.
Would you buy the day after the Hammer?
No. If you said yes, you might want to re-
read the previous chapter. To be a true
reversal, the Hammer signal needs
confirmation. In this case there was none.
However, the Hammer was followed by an
Inverted Hammer. The day after that was a
Doji day, where price closed higher and

Doji day, where price closed higher and
confirmed the presence of the bulls. I would
probably have bought after prices gapped up
following the Doji day.
Here, again, the market was giving strong
signals to the trader who was tuning in. It
gave him a Hammer, then followed that with
an Inverted Hammer, then followed that witha Doji, and then a gap up. All these signals
were suggesting that the bulls were coming
into the stock. Learn to analyze these

Chunk 2311 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):

The upper shadow must be at least twice
the size of the body.
The day after the Shooting Star signal
should witness continued selling and a
lower close.
There should be no lower shadow or
very small lower shadow.Why the Reversal Works
Consider a stock in an up trend. When do
most novice investors tend to buy? Right at
the top! After a stock has gone up, they

Chunk 2312 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
the top! After a stock has gone up, they
convince themselves that it will keep going
up. Exuberance sets in. One day, as the stock
opens higher or relatively flat, the investors
jump in and create a huge white candle
during the day. Smart money starts selling
noticing the greed in the stock. The selling
brings the price down, creating a long upper
shadow. If the stock closes lower the day
after the Shooting Star, the trend is said to be
reversed.
The following conditions make the reversal

Chunk 2313 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
The following conditions make the reversal
of the up trend more convincing:There is a spike in volume on the day of
the signal.
There is a gap up from the previous close
on the day of the signal, indicating
exuberant buying at the top.
Stochastics are in overbought condition.
The longer the upper shadow, the better.
The colour of the Shooting Star body
does not matter, but a black body would
be a stronger confirmation.
Figure 5.7 shows a Shooting Star formation

Figure 5.7 shows a Shooting Star formation
in the Tata Teleservices chart.Figure 5.7: Shooting Star in Tata
Teleservices starts its downtrend
The Shooting Star formation in overbought
conditions and with above average volume
gives a candlestick trader the perfect
opportunity to enter into a short side trade.
When would a trader enter the market in thiscase?
Keep in mind that you are always looking for
confirmation of the candlestick signal. This
was provided by the bears the following day

Chunk 2315 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
was provided by the bears the following day
by closing the price below the low of the
Shooting Star. The trader would have been
handsomely rewarded for his chart analyzing
talents in this case.

imperfect Shooting Star formation in Nocil.
Figure 5.9: Bulls fail to hold on after the

There is a tiny lower shadow in that
Shooting Star. Given the size of the upper
shadow, that length of lower shadow is
acceptable. Notice the Shooting Star did notconfirm the next day as it was a Doji /
Spinning Top. Correct entry point would be

We have now covered the major one-day
reversal signals. The important point to
remember about them is to wait for
confirmation. In the next couple of chapters
we will focus on and analyze the major two-
day candlestick reversal patterns.6
Engulfing Signals
There are two types of engulfing signals
defined by candlestick formations. These

Chunk 2318 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
defined by candlestick formations. These
belong to the two-day reversal patterns. We
will first look at Bullish Engulfing pattern.Bullish Engulfing
Description
Figure 6.1 shows a classic Bullish Engulfing
signal.
Figure 6.1: Bullish Engulfing signal
The signal is formed when a subsequentwhite body completely engulfs the previous
black body.Criteria
In order for the bullish engulfing signal to be
valid, the following conditions must exist:

Chunk 2319 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
The stock must have been in a definite
downtrend before this signal occurs. This
can be visually seen on the chart.
The second day of the signal should be
white and the body should completely
engulf the previous day’s black candle
body. Even if the first day is a Doji
(described in Chapter 3), it is still a
bullish engulfing signal.

the white engulfing candle. The bulls have
now taken over. The bulls have showntremendous strength, which does not go
unnoticed by the bears. The trend has a high
probability of reversing at this point.
Strong as the signal is in itself, the following
conditions make it more probable that the
trend has reversed:

trend has reversed:
The first day’s dark candle body is very
long compared to other candles in the
current downtrend.
There is a spike in volume on either of
the two signal days.
The first dark candle has gapped down
from the previous trend. This shows the
desperate need for the remaining panic
sellers to get out of the stock.Stochastics are in oversold condition.
The second day’s white body engulfs
more than one black candle from the
previous trend.

What should a buyer look for after any
bullish reversal signal? More buying! This
sounds like a simple answer and the fact of
the matter is that it is. However, most
investors and traders do not use this simple
logic. The buyer should await some
confirmation that the bulls are still in control
of the stock. It is not uncommon to see some
residual selling after a big bullish engulfing

Why the Reversal Works
Consider a stock which has been steadilymoving up. The investors in the stock are
growing exuberant by the day they see the

Chunk 2330 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
growing exuberant by the day they see the
stock go up. The bulls are happy and relaxed.
After days of continued up trend, the amateur
investors finally convince themselves of
buying into the stock. They cannot bear to
watch its price go up and not participate in
it. Again, where do most investors buy? At
the top!
This creates the long white candle of the first
day. The pent up demand makes the stock gap
up the next day. But now the smart money is
selling into the final rally. The demand of the

Chunk 2331 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
selling into the final rally. The demand of the
novice investors is constantly filled by the
supply from experienced traders. The stock
finally closes below the open of the previous
day, thus creating the dark engulfing candle.The bears have now taken over. The trend
has a high possibility of reversal.
Strong as the signal is by itself, the following
conditions make it more convincing:
The first day’s white candle body is very
long compared to the rest of the trading
range.

Chunk 2332 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
long compared to the rest of the trading
range.
There is a spike in volume on either of
the two signal days.
The first white candle has gapped up
from the previous trend. This shows the
desperate need of the novice investors to
get into the stock.
Stochastics are in overbought condition.
The second day’s dark body engulfs morethan one white candle from the previous
trend.

Figure 6.7: Bearish Engulfing signal near
overbought conditions in HindustanMotors
As you can see, candlestick charting clearly
depicts investor sentiment changing in the
stock. A candlestick trader could have long
seen the deterioration in the health of this
stock before the bearish engulfing signal
finally broke it down.
Figure 6.8 clearly reveals the exuberance of
the novice investors buying into the top of the
trend.Figure 6.8: ITI Ltd. showing Bearish

How often do we get caught in this situation?
When the stock rallied from below ` 30, the
novice investor wanted to wait to see if this
was a good stock. The investor was finally
convinced that this stock deserves his or hermoney somewhere in the ` 70 range. Finally,
when it looks like everybody in the
neighbourhood is buying in the stock, the

see after the Bearish Engulfing pattern? Moreselling!

Chunk 2336 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
The candlestick signals have been tested
through 400 years of trading. They signify a
high degree of probability that the trend is
about to reverse. The trader should always
keep this in mind. This will help build
confidence while actually placing a trade.

bearish strategies. Another high probability
scenario to be taken advantage of!

Stochastics indicated that the index was in an
overbought condition. This created a high
probability situation for trend reversal. If
you do not want to trade the index itself, you
can find stocks which are exhibiting sell
signals at this time. With the market index
showing a bearish engulfing pattern, there is
a high probability that the component stocks

Chunk 2339 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
a high probability that the component stocks
with a bearish reversal signal will make for
a profitable trade to the downside.
Candlestick signals are universal. They can
be applied to indexes as well.
Exceptions
There is one unique set-up that sometimesoccurs the trend of bullish and bearish
engulfing patterns, which can be summarized
as follows.
If a bullish engulfing signal occurs when
the stock is in an overbought condition,
then the signal has bearish implications.

Chunk 2340 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
then the signal has bearish implications.
This is usually referred to as last-gasp
buying. The novice investors seeing the
price gap down are thrilled to get into the
stock. Their enthusiasm drives the stock
price higher for the day causing the bullish
engulfing pattern. Unfortunately, the smart
money is selling their stock. The trader must
now be alert for signs that the trend is about
to turn down.
Let us analyse the chart of NagarjunaFertiliser and Chemicals Ltd (Figure 6.12),

Chunk 2341 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
for the three days starting May 11th.
Figure 6.12: Bullish engulfing signal in
overbought conditions is not a buy
scenario
The stock had a bearish engulfing signal on
May 11th. The trader should now be on
guard to take profits if the signal isconfirmed.
On May 12th, the stock opened lower, but
then immediately headed higher. This is not
what you want to see after a bearish
engulfing signal. By the end of the day, it had
formed a bullish engulfing signal. The trader

Chunk 2342 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
formed a bullish engulfing signal. The trader
should now start expecting a sell signal
anytime, knowing the reasoning behind this
phenomenon.
The very next day witnessed a bearish
engulfing signal, which was confirmed the
day after by more selling.
Proper use of candlestick signals can lead to
highly profitable trades. It helps the trader’s
confidence immensely if he also understandsthe psychology behind the signals.
If a bearish engulfing signal is witnessed in
an oversold condition, then the

Chunk 2343 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
an oversold condition, then the
implications of such a signal are bullish.
Take a moment to visualize what is going on
in such a case. After an extended downtrend,
smart money has started buying. This
pressure causes prices to gap up. The novice
investors, looking to take advantage of the
higher prices on the open, start selling
causing the temporary bearish engulfing
pattern. Most of the times the smart money is
strong enough to turn the tide in the reverse
direction.

Chunk 2344 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
direction.
Candlestick signals have stood the test of
time and made huge fortunes for those whohave correctly utilized them. Learn to read
and analyse the chart day by day. Always
keep in mind the following two simple facts:
If you witness a candlestick sell signal in
overbought condition, it has to be
followed by more selling to prove that
the sellers are still around.
If you witness a candlestick buy signal in
oversold condition, it has to be followed
by more buying to confirm that the buyers

Chunk 2345 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
by more buying to confirm that the buyers
are forceful enough to turn the trend.
Simple as these facts may seem, they can
make or break a trader!7
Dark Cloud and Piercing
Signals
This chapter will describe in detail the
nuances of trading the Dark Cloud signal and
the Piercing signal. These also belong to the
class of two-day reversal signals. They are
sort of like a “semi” completed version of
the Bearish Engulfing and the Bullish
Engulfing signal, respectively.Piercing Signal
Description

Chunk 2346 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Description
Figure 7.1 shows a classic Piercing Signal.
As you can see, the signal is formed when a
white coloured body opens below the low of
the previous day’s trading range and closes
above the half-way point of that dark body.Figure 7.1: Piercing SignalCriteria
In order for the piercing signal to be valid,
the following conditions must exist:
The stock must have been in a definite
downtrend before this signal occurs. This
can be visually seen on the chart.

Chunk 2347 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
can be visually seen on the chart.
The second day of the signal should be a
white candle opening below the trading
range of the previous day and closing at
least half way into the body of the
previous day’s dark candle.
Why the Reversal Works
Let us say stock XYZ is moving downsteadily. There comes a time when investors
who are suffering losses in that stock begin
doubting themselves. They start getting
emotionally drained looking at their
portfolios every day. Finally, they give up.

Chunk 2348 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
portfolios every day. Finally, they give up.
Usually there is a climactic sell-off in the
stock. Next day the stock gaps down and
smart money pours in. The supply of shares
is snapped up by the demand. The stock
starts rising and finally closes up for the day
creating the white candle body. Now, the
Japanese give great importance to the
number 2. They have found over centuries of
trading that if the bulls can manage to close
the second day’s candle more than half way

Chunk 2349 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
the second day’s candle more than half way
up the previous black candle, that puts the
probabilities greatly in their favour that they
have reversed the trend.The existence of the following conditions
makes the trend reversal more convincing:
The first day’s dark candle body is very
long compared to the rest of the trading
range.
There is a spike in volume on either of
the two signal days.
The first dark candle has gapped down
from the previous trend. This shows the

Chunk 2350 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
from the previous trend. This shows the
desperate need for the last of panic
sellers to get out of the stock.
Stochastics are in oversold condition.
The second day’s white body opens way
below the trading range of the previous
day.Figure 7.2 shows a chart of Essar Oil.
Notice how the trend reversed with a
piercing signal. Also observe that the
stochastics were in the oversold region,
giving that much more weight to the
probability of this happening.

Chunk 2351 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
probability of this happening.

Observe the chart of GE Shipping in Figure
7.3.

Piercing signal in GE Shipping
The first day of the pattern was a gap downdark bodied candle. Given the fact that the
stochastics are in oversold condition, this
was a clue for any trader to watch closely
for a trend reversal sign. The trader at this
point should visually be imagining the panic

Chunk 2352 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
point should visually be imagining the panic
most investors are going through and should
be ready to act at the first signs of smart
money moving in. That sign was given the
next day with a piercing signal.
Figure 7.4 shows how the bulls reversed the
downtrend with a Piercing signal.Figure 7.4: Mahindra and Mahindra going
up after a huge Piercing candle
Notice that in this case the stochastics were
not in the ideal oversold conditions.
However, one should remember that the

Chunk 2353 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
However, one should remember that the
candlestick signal is the primary factor. The
oscillators are secondary factors. Though theprobabilities are higher for a trend reversing
when the signal is formed in the oversold
area, the trader should not neglect these
opportunities. This is especially true in
strong trending markets when the position
never pulls back enough to get oversold.

On the second day of the signal, the
candle should open above the previous
white coloured body’s trading range and
close more than half way into it, thus
forming a black body.
Why the Reversal WorksConsider a stock moving up. Things are rosy
and investors are happy. Then one day the
exuberance sets in forming a good sized
white candle. The next day the price gaps up
and smart money starts selling the stock to
novice traders. The selling overwhelms the
buying and finally the candle closes more

Chunk 2357 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
buying and finally the candle closes more
than half way into the previous white candle.
As in the case of the Piercing pattern, the
important thing to notice is that the dark
candle closes deeply, at least half way, into
the previous candle.
The following conditions make it more
convincing that the trend has reversed:
The first day’s white candle body is very
long compared to the recent tradingrange.
There is a spike in volume on either of
the two signal days.

Why the Reversal Works
Consider a stock trending down. As usual,

stock gaps up and smart money starts sapping
up the supply. The bulls are able to close the
candle towards the upper range of the
previous day. This makes the bears nervous.
Those who have shorted the stock in the hope
that it will keep going down are now having
second thoughts. They are waiting to see
what happens the next day. If the bulls are
still in the stock the next day, those with short
positions begin to cover their positions, thus

smaller candle to be engulfed by the
previous candle.Figure 8.2: Bearish Harami signalCriteria
In order for the Bearish Harami signal to be

Chunk 2369 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
In order for the Bearish Harami signal to be
valid, the following conditions must exist:
The stock must have been in a definite up
trend before this signal occurs. This can
be visually seen on the chart.
The second day of the signal should be
black and the body should be completely
engulfed by the previous day’s white
candle body.
Why the Reversal Works
Consider a stock trending up. As is most
often the case, the novice investors andtraders buy exuberantly at the top creating the

Chunk 2370 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
long white candle. However, due to some
news or change in perception after market
hours, the stock becomes less desirable to
own. The next day the stock gaps down and
smart money starts selling. The bears are
able to close the candle down towards the
lower range of the previous day. This makes
the bulls nervous. Those who have recently
bought the stock in the hope that it will keep
going up are now on the edge. They are
waiting to see what happens the next day. If

Chunk 2371 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
waiting to see what happens the next day. If
the bears are still in the stock the next day,
the selling continues and the stock starts
heading lower. Those with recent long
positions start selling to get out with a small
loss and along with the bears shorting, the
stock tumbles down.The following conditions can make the
Bearish Harami signal more compelling to
short:
The longer the white engulfing candle
and the black engulfed candle, the higher
the chance that the trend will be
reversed.

Chunk 2372 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
the chance that the trend will be
reversed.
There is heavy volume on either of the
two days of the signal formation.
Stochastics are in an overbought
condition.
The deeper the black candle closes into
the white candle body, the higher the
probability of reversal.
You will notice on some of the charts that thesecond day of the signal (the engulfed
candle) is one of the one-day reversal
signals. In cases of a Bearish Harami, it
could be a Hanging Man or a Shooting Star,
or even a Doji.

Chunk 2373 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
or even a Doji.
Conversely, in cases of a Bullish Harami, it
could be a Hammer or an Inverted Hammer
or a Doji. This adds weight to the fact that
reversal is about to happen. When you see
more than one candlestick signal at any point
in a trend indicating that a trend reversal is
possible, take notice immediately!
Figure 8.3 shows a Bullish Harami formation
in Hindustan Motors.Figure 8.3: Bullish Harami in Hindustan
Motors starts its up trend
Notice how the price gapped up the day after

Chunk 2374 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Notice how the price gapped up the day after
the Harami signal formed. What does this tell
you as a candlestick trader? It tells you that
other investors want to get into this stock in a
hurry. After the downtrend, something has
changed the perception towards the stock.Maybe it was a good earnings report or a
huge contract gain. As a trader, it is
immaterial to find out what the news was that
changed the perception. It is always helpful
to know, but not necessary. As a trader, you

Chunk 2375 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
to know, but not necessary. As a trader, you
are more concerned about the strength of the
new upturn. Seeing the gap up should give
you the required confidence that there is a
strong force behind the up move. Time to
jump in!
Figure 8.4 shows the chart of IPCL.Figure 8.4: Confirmed Bullish Harami
reverses downtrend in IPCL
Notice the two arrows marked in the
downtrend. Both are pointing to Harami
formations. You can see that the selling
continued after the first Harami had formed.

Chunk 2376 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
continued after the first Harami had formed.
The second Harami stopped the selling and a
new upturn was initiated. The question to askyourself is — should you have considered
buying after the first Harami? I would not.
Why? Because there was no confirmation
buying the day after the signal was formed. In
fact prices gapped down after this Harami.
This is not what you would expect after a
candlestick buy signal. Stochastics were still
heading down, too. How about the second

Chunk 2377 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
heading down, too. How about the second
Harami? Prices gapped up after this Harami
and closed higher. Stochastics were oversold
by this time, thus creating a high probability
reversal situation.
This is not to say that all signals that get
confirmed will result in a profitable trade.
We will get into the signal failure scenarios
in Chapter 11. This example was just to
show you that analyzing the signals andunderstanding the nuances can avoid a lot of
bad trades. This does two things, it helps

Chunk 2378 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
bad trades. This does two things, it helps
preserve your capital and, more importantly,
it helps keep your trading confidence high.
The chart of the Nifty index is shown in
Figure 8.5.
Figure 8.5: Bullish and Bearish Harami in
Nifty
Notice the chart at point A. This formation
looks like the Harami, but it actually is not.
Nifty opened a point higher than where it had
closed the day before. This does not satisfy
the conditions needed for the Harami
formation. Point B is a Bearish Harami.

Chunk 2379 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
formation. Point B is a Bearish Harami.
Nifty opened exactly where it had closed the
night before. This is acceptable and satisfies
the criteria of engulfment. Point C is a
Bullish Harami. This stopped the pullback of
the Nifty and was a precursor to a huge run
up of the index.
Figure 8.6 shows a Bullish Harami in the
chart of Tata Tea. Notice the long dark
candle in oversold conditions. This shouldhave been the trader’s first alert. He should
have been on the lookout for a buy signal

Chunk 2380 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
have been on the lookout for a buy signal
from then on. The next day a Harami was
formed. The trader should then have
analyzed the Harami formation. Look at the
long lower shadow. The bears tried to take
control on that day, but failed.
Figure 8.6: Bullish Harami in upper region
of a previous body is a very powerful buy
signal
The bulls had not only managed to gap up the
price from the previous close, but also to
close it higher than the open. The ideal point
would have been to buy the stock on

Chunk 2381 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
would have been to buy the stock on
confirmation after the Harami.
Figure 8.7 shows the chart of Rolta India.Figure 8.7: Bullish Harami in Rolta
Notice the couple of Harami formations in
March 2005. The first Harami formation
(Point A) would have resulted in a small
loss, if a trader would have purchased the
stock on the gap up after the Harami. Again,
this will be dealt with in Chapter 11. The
second Harami formation (Point B) has ahigh significance. It is a confirmation of the

Chunk 2382 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
bulls entering the market. The fact that you
can see two Harami formations at the same
level indicates a great desire on the part of
the bulls to not let the prices fall further.
Guess what this confirmation Harami does to
the bear’s psyche? If the first Harami made
them nervous, the second Harami at the same
level dissolves their confidence. The shorts
start covering their position. New buying
comes in. The candlestick trader should be
buying as soon as the prices open higher the

Chunk 2383 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
buying as soon as the prices open higher the
next day. In this case, the prices again
gapped up adding to the confirmation of
trend reversal. Notice how in June 2005 the
rapid pullback was also stopped with a
spinning top Harami (Point C).Finally, let us look at the chart of ABB Ltd.
(Figure 8.8)
Figure 8.8: Bullish and Bearish Harami
reversing trends in ABB Ltd.
Notice how after the price had risen from
around the ` 2,800 area to the ` 3,300 area,

Chunk 2384 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
around the ` 2,800 area to the ` 3,300 area,
the candles started getting bigger and thevolume started expanding. Investors were
now buying exuberantly. If you had owned
this stock, where would you sell it? The
correct point would have been to sell as
soon as the Bearish Harami got confirmed.
Remember, the point of trading is not to buy
exactly at the bottom and sell exactly at the
top. Leave that to somebody else to try. It is
simply too difficult and not worth the risk.

Chunk 2385 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):

Morning Star and Evening Star
Signals
The Morning Star and Evening Star are very
powerful three-day reversal signals and once
mastered they help traders reap huge profits.Morning Star Signal
Description
Figure 9.1 shows a Morning Star signal
formation. The Japanese named it so because
like the planet Mercury, which is known as

Chunk 2386 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
like the planet Mercury, which is known as
the morning star, it foretells of good things to
come (morning). In the case of stocks, it
means that the prices will start moving
higher from here on.Figure 9.1: Morning Star signalCriteria
In order for the Morning Star signal to be
valid, the following conditions must exist:
The stock must have been in a definite
downtrend before this signal occurs. This
can be visually seen on the chart.
The first day of the signal must be a long

Chunk 2387 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
The first day of the signal must be a long
dark body. The second day must be a day
of indecision. The third day should be a
long white candle reaching at least half
way into the body of the first day’s dark
candle.
There are many variations of the Morning
Star signal. Figure 9.2 shows a few of thesevariations.
Figure 9.2: Morning Star signal variations
Why the Reversal Works
Consider a stock which has been steadily
moving down. Then one day panic grips the

Chunk 2388 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
moving down. Then one day panic grips the
investors in that stock. They no longer want
to hold on to the losing position. This panicselling creates a long dark candle. The next
day there is a battle between the bulls and
bears. Smart money is buying and the final
panicky sellers are happy to sell to them.
This creates indecision. The bulls seize this
opportunity to get control of the stock. The
short sellers start covering their position
leading to further upward movement. The

Chunk 2389 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
leading to further upward movement. The
signal is formed when bulls are able to close
the candle half way up the dark candle
formed two days back. Probabilities support
trend reversal at this point.
The Morning Star signal is a very visual
signal, where you can actually see the change
in investor perception towards the stock. In
Figure 9.2, you can witness the various days
of indecision. If the middle day is a one-dayreversal signal, that adds more weight to the
Morning Star signal.

Chunk 2390 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Morning Star signal.
Notice the Abandoned Baby Morning Star
signal shown in the same figure. This is a
very powerful reversal signal. Analyze the
formation. There is a gap between the low of
the first day and the high of the second day.
There is also a gap between the high of the
second day and the low of the third day.
What is going on in that formation in terms of
fear and greed? The first gap shows panic
selling in the stock. Then the bulls and the

Chunk 2391 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
selling in the stock. Then the bulls and the
bears get locked into a fight. The third day
shows the outcome of the fight. The second
gap represents the strength of the victory.
You as a candlestick trader have to be in this
stock at this point!The following circumstances will further
enhance the probability of reversal shown by
the Morning Star signal:
The first day’s dark candle body is very
long compared to the rest of the trading
range. By definition of the signal, this

Chunk 2392 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
range. By definition of the signal, this
would necessitate that the bullish candle
on the third day be large as well.
There is a spike in volume on the
indecision day.
Stochastics are in an oversold condition.
The second day forms one of the one-day
candlestick reversal signals.
Figure 9.3 shows the chart of Bharat Heavy
Electricals Limited.Figure 9.3: A big Morning star signal in
oversold conditions in BHEL
Notice the excellent Morning Star formation
in mid-January 2007. By now your eyes

Chunk 2393 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
in mid-January 2007. By now your eyes
should be trained to notice some obvious
things. The position of Stochastics, the heavy
volume, and the large candles on the first and
third day of the formation all lead to a textbook type Morning Star signal.
Also notice the arrow marked on the chart in
mid-December 2006. Can you analyze why
this is not a Morning Star signal?
If you noticed that the third day of the signal
did not penetrate at least half of the first
day’s black candle, you are right. As

Chunk 2394 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
day’s black candle, you are right. As
mentioned before, the Japanese have placed
a lot of emphasis on the half way point. The
closing of the white candle over the half way
point shows the credibility of the strength of
the bulls. It was missing in this case.
Figure 9.4 shows a Morning Star formation
in Cummins India Ltd. chart.Figure 9.4: Morning Start signal reversing
the downtrend in Cummins India
Notice in this chart that the stock gapped up
after the indecision day, even though it traded

Chunk 2395 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
after the indecision day, even though it traded
down during the day. That gap up represents
the forceful nature of the bulls. This always
adds weight to the reversal.Figure 9.5 shows a Hammer Morning Star
signal.
Figure 9.5: Morning star signal in Essar
Oil
The Hammer tells you that all the remaining
sellers got washed out. The stock changedhands from the weak to the strong. The third
day witnessed prices closing just above the
half way point of the first day’s dark candle.

Chunk 2396 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
half way point of the first day’s dark candle.
Sometimes in a Morning Star formation, the
middle day is not exactly a Doji type day. It
is a small body, indecisive day (also called a
Spinning Top). Analyze the signal formation
in Figure 9.6 (Point B) keeping in mind the
action behind the scenes. After the first down
day, the sellers were not able to drive down
the price much lower. The bulls stepped in
on the third day to take control after seeing

Point A in the chart also shows the trend
reversed with a Morning Star signal. What
stopped this up trend? The Shooting Stars
and the Bearish Engulfing signal.
Let us close our discussion of Morning Starsignals with Figure 9.7 showing a chart of
Tata Steel.

Morning Star signal
We can see a well defined Morning Star
signal form in mid-June 2006. Let us assume
as a trader you buy into the position. Wherewill you take profits?
As you can see from the chart, the correct
place to take profits was after Point 5. Let us
analyze why we should not have taken profits
earlier:
Point 1: A Dark Cloud signal is formed in
overbought conditions. What do you
want to see the next day?
Confirmation selling! In this case
there was none.

Chunk 2399 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
there was none.
Point 2: This is not a Bearish Harami. The
colour of the candles is opposite to
the definition of a Bearish Harami.
Point 3: This shows another Dark Cloud
signal. The bears are really tryinghard, but fail yet again to produce
confirmation selling.
Point 4: This is a repeat of Point 3.
Point 5: This shows a Bearish Harami in
overbought conditions. What happens
the next day? A gap down! As
mentioned before, a gap up or gap
down after a candlestick signal

Chunk 2400 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
down after a candlestick signal

have led you to take profits at this
time.Evening Star Signal
Description
Figure 9.8 shows an Evening Star signal
formation.

The Japanese named it so because like theplanet Venus, which is also known as the

means that the prices will be heading lower
from that point.Criteria
In order for an Evening Star signal to be
valid, the following conditions must exist:
The price must have been in a definite up
trend before this signal occurs.
The first day of the signal must be a long
white body. The second day must be a
day of indecision. The third day should
be a long dark candle reaching down at
least half way into the body of the first
day’s white candle.

day’s white candle.
Figure 9.9 shows a few of these variations of
the Evening Star signal.Figure 9.9: Evening Star signal variations
Why the Reversal Works
After an up trend, the novice investors finally
start piling into the stock. This creates the
exuberant white candle at the top. The next
day, the demand is consistently met with
supply from the smart money. The indecision
day is followed by a large down day,
indicating the bears finally taking controlfrom the bulls. As in the case of the

Chunk 2403 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
abandoned baby Morning Star signal, seeing
a gap between the first and second day and
also a gap between the second and third day
shows a massive change in investor
psychology. Traders should immediately
cash out their positions, or go short.
The following circumstances will further
enhance the probability of reversal shown by
the Evening Star signal:
The first day’s white candle body is very
long compared to the rest of the trading
range, indicating exuberant buying.

Chunk 2404 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
range, indicating exuberant buying.
There is a spike in volume on the
indecision day.Stochastics are in overbought condition.
The second day forms one of the one-day
candlestick reversal signals. Figure 9.10
shows an Evening Star formation in
Hindustan Lever.
Figure 9.10: Hindustan Lever falls after anEvening Star signal
Notice that a Bearish Harami is part of the
three day signal. As I mentioned before, this
adds more weight to the reversal. One more

Chunk 2405 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
adds more weight to the reversal. One more
point to mention for this chart is the presence
of a Hanging Man signal a couple of days
before the Evening Star signal. The Hanging
Man was not confirmed. The trader who
bought into the stock after the confirmed
Hammer signal should have got out after the
Evening Star signal.
The chart in Figure 9.11 shows a classic
Evening Star signal.Figure 9.11: Combination of Shooting Star
and Evening Star signals take down S.
Kumars

Chunk 2406 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
and Evening Star signals take down S.
Kumars
The first sign of the bulls weakening was
seen with the Shooting Star signal. The
candlestick trader would not have acted on
this as it did not get confirmed. Seeing theEvening Star signal form in the immediate
vicinity of the Shooting Star gives the
candlestick trader greater confidence that the
up trend is reversing.
Going short after the Evening Star signal in
Figure 9.12 would have given a candlestick
trader very good profits.

major candlestick reversal signals. We have

reversal signals work and their effectiveness
at producing strong profits.
What is expected of the readers at this point
is a complete change in their perception of
how the markets work. The stock markets, or
for that matter all other financial markets,

Combining Candlesticks with
Technical Analysis
In this chapter we will look at candlestick
signals in combination with other technical
indicators. As you might have noticed, thus
far in all the charts we have always used
stochastics and volume in the lower portion
of the chart. We will be consistent in doing
that. If you are familiar and comfortable with
RSI, MACD or any other oscillator which

Chunk 2413 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
RSI, MACD or any other oscillator which
shows overbought / oversold conditions, that
is perfectly fine. The key is to find highprobability trades utilizing candlestick
signals when a security is in these extreme
conditions.
We will discuss candlestick signals in
conjunction with the following:
Support / resistance trend lines; and
Moving averages.
Every trader must read as many technical
analysis books as possible in order to gain
more and more in-depth knowledge of this

Chunk 2414 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
more and more in-depth knowledge of this
field. Education is the most essential weapon
in your trading arsenal. It takes years of
education and training to become a
successful doctor, an engineer or an
architect. Please do not think trading isotherwise. Trading might seem very easy
when looking at it from the outside. But in
reality it is not. A trader has to be armed

The stock market is a dynamic arena. Prices
fluctuate up and down, sometimes on news,
other times seemingly with no justification.
Fundamentals of a company do not cause
prices to move. It is the reaction of the
people trading that stock that whipsaws
the price. If prices were to move based only
on the fundamentals of a company, then the
stock market would be a discrete market
where the price jumps from one point to the

Chunk 2416 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
where the price jumps from one point to the
next only after some news hits the wires. The
rest of the time it would be at a constant,
fixed price. We all know that does not
happen. Prices change everyday. They
change because somebody has a change in
perception for that stock. Technical analysisis the study of that perception change as seen
in a chart. What better way to see this change
of perception than using a candlestick chart.
Figure 10.1 shows a stock vacillating back

Chunk 2417 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Figure 10.1 shows a stock vacillating back
and forth between two price levels in a
sideways market.
Figure 10.1: Support and ResistanceWhenever the stock approaches the top price
level, it sells off. The supply side of
equation becomes greater than the demand
side. This price level, where there is
seemingly more supply than demand, is
defined as a resistance level. The stock is
now under pressure. The bears continue to
dominate and take it down towards another

Chunk 2418 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
dominate and take it down towards another
price level, where the perception towards
that stock changes 180 degrees. The demand
side of equation now becomes greater than
its supply side. This price level where
there is more demand than supply is
termed as a support level.
Note: You can print out a chart and draw these
support/resistance lines yourself. You can also
use a Java charting application from websitessuch as Icharts.in, which will allow you to
draw these lines online.

Chunk 2419 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
draw these lines online.
So why does the stock keep doing what it
does, i.e. go back and forth? The answer lies
within us. We humans tend to remember
things. Consider a stock which you wanted to
buy but missed because of any number of
reasons. What will happen when the stock
pulls back to your original buy point?
Naturally, you will jump in. Now consider
thousands of traders doing that same thing. If
the stock turns and starts heading back up,
take a guess where you will start to feel

Chunk 2420 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
take a guess where you will start to feel
panicky. It would be right about the same
place where it started coming down from the
last time. This process gets repeated until
either the stock breaks the resistance leveland heads higher or else breaks the support
and tumbles down.
Figure 10.2 shows support and resistance
lines for an up-trending and a down-trending
stock. The logic behind the support /
resistance lines, also referred to as trend-
lines, is exactly the same as described
above.

Chunk 2421 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
lines, is exactly the same as described
above.
Figure 10.2: Trend channelsLet me emphasize this point again. You are
trading human emotions in the market, not the
actual stock. The faster you accept this
mantra, the clearer you will hear the market
signals.
A few points about these trend lines:
Trend-lines can be horizontal or sloping.
The more number of times the price tests
the trend line, the stronger the support or
resistance.
Once a support trend line is broken,

Chunk 2422 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
resistance.
Once a support trend line is broken,
not intraday, but on a closing basis, it
will function as a resistance trend line
from then on. Similarly, once a
resistance trend-line is broken on aclosing basis, it will function as a
support trend-line from that point
onwards.
This is better explained visually in Figure
10.3 and Figure 10.4.

Notice the different trend-lines that can be
seen. Also notice that in December, the stock
tested the old resistance line. This time,
though, that line acted as support. If you are
now thorough with the candlestick signals,
you will recognize the bullish Harami whichstopped the selling in December, right on the
support line. Please analyze the three signals

Chunk 2424 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):

that are circled in the chart.
The trader should also be aware of the fact
that these trend lines are subjective. You can
draw a trend line which can be different than
the one I draw. After all, you are just taking
two or more points on the chart and plotting
a line through them. Then what is it that
determines which is the correct trend line to
be trading off?
Let the market tell you which the correct
trend line is. As a candlestick trader, what

Chunk 2425 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
trend line is. As a candlestick trader, what
would you expect the market to show
when approaching a trend line? A
candlestick signal! Therefore, whichevertrend line the signal is formed at is the
correct trend line.

Notice the chart of Satyam Computer in
Figure 10.7Figure 10.7: Satyam Computer riding up in
a trend channel
This chart clearly defines a trend channel for
the stock from around August 2006 till
February 2007. Every time the stock hits the
upper trend channel, the supply of shares

Chunk 2427 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
upper trend channel, the supply of shares
exceeds the demand for them. Similarly, thedemand for the stock is heavy along the
lower channel. These demand-supply
imbalances make the stock fluctuate between
those imaginary trend lines. Close
observation of the chart at the reversal points
along the trend channel indicates the
following points:
Point 1: Bullish Harami.
Point 2: Hanging Man.
Point 3: Bullish Harami.
Point 4: Bearish Engulfing.
Point 5: Bullish Engulfing.

Chunk 2428 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Point 5: Bullish Engulfing.
Point 6: This illustrates the previous trendchannel now acting as resistance.
The examples above show how candlesticks
work with support and resistance lines. If as
a trader you anticipate a reversal situation at
a particular point on the chart, then the
knowledge of candlesticks will add
confirmation to your expectation. If you
expect a stock to turn lower at a resistance
point but candlesticks show a tall white
candle breaching that point, then your

Chunk 2429 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
candle breaching that point, then your
expectation should be negated. You should
realize at that point that the stock has broken
resistance with good force. On the other
hand, if you see a Doji followed by a
Hanging Man and a lower close at that
resistance point, you know your expectation
is fulfilled. The probabilities are in thefavour of the stock heading down.Moving Averages
Moving averages essentially provide a
directional trend to a stock or the market.

Chunk 2430 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
directional trend to a stock or the market.
They smooth out the ups and downs of the
trend and provide the immediate direction
the stock is headed in. Moving averages have
a lot of applications in technical trading. The
most common way traders have used them in
the past is to buy a stock whenever a shorter
term moving average (MA) crosses upward
through a longer term moving average.
Conversely, they would sell a stock
whenever the shorter term MA crossed
below the longer term MA.

Chunk 2431 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
below the longer term MA.
This application of moving averages is,
however, usually not the best technique tofollow as it is a lagging method. What this
means is that the signal to buy is often
generated too late in the trend.
Using candlestick signals with moving
averages enhances the returns on
investment many-fold. These moving
averages provide support and resistance to a
trending stock just like the trend-lines we
drew in the previous section of this chapter.

Chunk 2432 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
drew in the previous section of this chapter.
The most common moving averages are the
simple MA and the exponential MA. For our
discussion purposes, we will stick to the
simple moving average (SMA). Readers
should refer to other technical analysis books
if they want further information on
exponential MAs.The simple MA is defined as follows:
Moving Average (N) = (A1+A2+A3+ . . . + AN) / N
Where N = the period over which the average is
calculated.

Chunk 2433 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
calculated.
A1 . . . An = closing prices over the last N days.
This is a dynamic curve and is calculated
every day after prices close. Most money
managers in the world use 50 MA or 200
MA. For trading purposes, having a 20- or a
30-day MA is optimal. The key to using the
correct moving average is to let the stock
chart tell you. Pull up a chart and put various
moving averages on it. This is very easy
nowadays with online charting. All you have
to do is select “Simple Moving Average”

Chunk 2434 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
to do is select “Simple Moving Average”
and type in different numbers like 20, 30, 50,etc. Once you have these lines on the
candlestick chart, select the one from which
the stock bounces off (reverses or supports)
from the most. That is the moving average to
use.
Candlesticks are excellent for finding
reversal situations. They tell you the
internal dynamics of the market. However,
they do not give you a target price. You can
calculate the price targets using other tools

Chunk 2435 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
calculate the price targets using other tools
of technical analysis. One way is to see
where the dominant moving averages are.
Stocks will usually tend to fluctuate around
particular moving averages.
As an example, Figure 10.8 shows you the
chart of Grasim Industries.Figure 10.8: Grasim following its moving
averages
You can notice in the figure that in July 2006
a Morning Star signal formed right on the 50-
day simple moving average (SMA). From
that point on, the stock price used the 20

Chunk 2436 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
that point on, the stock price used the 20
SMA as support till December, when itfinally broke down below both the 50 SMA
and 20 SMA.
The moving averages act like magnets for the
price. The concept of moving averages is
similar to the concept of trend lines which
we discussed earlier. Moving averages are
dynamic trend lines.
Figure 10.9 shows a chart of Sujana Metal.Figure 10.9: Sujana Metal using the 50
SMA as support
Traders would have had a fun time trading

Chunk 2437 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Traders would have had a fun time trading
this chart. The 50 day SMA is a powerful
force for this stock. Notice the following
signals:Point 1: Bullish Harami.
Point 2: Doji with a gap up next day.
Remember, this is a powerful signal.
The Doji showed the indecision on
the part of bulls and bears and the
gap up the next day, showed the
decision being made in favour of the
bulls.
Point 3: Morning Star signal.
Point 4: Bullish Harami.
In concluding this chapter, it would be

Chunk 2438 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
In concluding this chapter, it would be
appropriate to emphasize that a trader needs
to have as much probability in his or her
favour as possible. A combination of
candlestick charts with technical analysis isan excellent system to achieve this.

Trading Setup
Thus far we have learnt the major
candlestick signals and how to use them with
common western technical analysis. You
have witnessed the high degree of accuracy
of these signals in predicting reversals. The

Chunk 2439 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
of these signals in predicting reversals. The
probability of the reversal is greatly
enhanced when two or more signals confirm
it. I have always put more weight on the
Morning Star and Evening Star signals if the
middle day is a one-day candlestick reversal
signal, such as a Hammer or Hanging Man. If
a bullish engulfing signal is forming at theexact support level from where the stock
bounced up the previous time, it brings that
much more credibility to the reversal.

Chunk 2440 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
much more credibility to the reversal.
This knowledge should put you way ahead of
your competitors. The next time when you
see a stock fall 10 percent, you will not rush
to buy it because it looks cheap. You have
probably heard of the saying, “Don’t try to
catch a falling knife”. That is very true. That
stock which is down 10 percent can further
go down another 20 percent. On the other
hand, it could very well reverse and start a
new leg up from here. You do not know

Chunk 2441 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
new leg up from here. You do not know
which of the two might happen. All you
know is the candle formation. Rely on the
signals. Do you see a buy signal form? Are
the stochastics in the right place? Is thereconfirmation buying? These are the points
you will be looking at.
As a candlestick trader, you are not
looking to buy exact bottoms and selling at
exact tops. You want the middle chunk of
the trend.
I have written this chapter with two
objectives in mind.

Chunk 2442 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
objectives in mind.
1. To show you the exit strategies when
candlestick signals fail because, yes, they
do sometimes fail!
2. To share trading ideas which I have
found useful over years of trading stocks
and options.Getting Real — Candlesticks Fail,
Too!
I would have liked to tell you that
candlestick signals are 100% effective, that
they never fail, that they are the magic
charms you have been waiting for.
Unfortunately, I cannot!
Candlestick signals are truly very effective.

Chunk 2443 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Candlestick signals are truly very effective.
They have been tested for over four
centuries. If they would not have worked,
they wouldn’t have been around this long.
They show reversal points with a high
degree of probability. But the key word is
probability. There are going to be times,
albeit only a few, when you have the perfect
signal, stochastics are in the perfect place,the signal is confirmed, you get in — and
then the stock starts heading in the other
direction. This is going to happen,

Chunk 2444 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
direction. This is going to happen,
guaranteed!
Trading is like a business. There are times in
a business where you face losses. That is
perfectly normal and expected by all good
businessmen.
They know that in order to succeed, their
gains must overcome their occasional losses.
This is the exact philosophy a trader needs to
have. Losses are inevitable in trading. You
cannot control the market environment. The
stock might be in an excellent buy scenario,

Chunk 2445 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
stock might be in an excellent buy scenario,
but the market might be falling out of the bed.
This will put pressure on the individualstock. It will negate the buy scenario with
some dark candles. In such a case the market
would have proved you wrong. As a trader,
you have two choices at this point:
1. Ride your ego. Ignore the fact that the
market negated the buy signal. Assure
yourself that you have more knowledge
than the combined market and that the
stock will go in your direction soon.

Chunk 2446 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
stock will go in your direction soon.
Keep holding — and watch your losses
mount.
2. Acknowledge the fact that this trade has
failed. Get out with a small loss and wait
for the next buy signal.
Most traders who choose the first optionequate the failed trade with a personal
failure. They cannot accept the fact that even
with all the technical analysis knowledge
they possess, they still have a losing trade. If
you have to succeed at trading, you will
have to overcome this pitfall. It is by no

Chunk 2447 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
have to overcome this pitfall. It is by no
means an easy one. But, nevertheless, you
will have to do it. There is no way around it.
All your candlestick and technical analysis
knowledge will not make your portfolio
grow if you cannot take a small loss.
The old but wise adage “Cut your losses
short and let your profits run” is the only way
to be a successful trader. So now the
question arises, “Where do you cut your
losses?” 2% down, or 5%, or 10%? Some

Chunk 2448 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
losses?” 2% down, or 5%, or 10%? Some
technical analysis books suggest 5%, otherssuggest 7%. These percentages do not mean
much to a candlestick trader. The questions
and answers that follow may look very
basic. Yet, they contain the key to a trader’s
dilemma of placing a stop loss.
Question: Why is the candlestick trader long
in the stock?
Answer: Because of a candlestick buy signal
formation.
Question: Where would the candlestick
trader place a stop loss?

Chunk 2449 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
trader place a stop loss?
Answer: The point which shows that the
candlestick buy signal is negated.
Question: Why is the candlestick tradershort in the stock?
Answer: Because of a candlestick sell signal
formation.
Question: Where would a candlestick trader
place a stop loss?
Answer: The point which shows that the
candlestick sell signal is negated.
As simple as that!
Just as there is a reason for buying a stock,
there should be reason for taking a loss. Let

Chunk 2450 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
there should be reason for taking a loss. Let
us analyze the stop loss scenario. As a
candlestick trader, you have found a perfect
buy signal in oversold conditions. You wait
for the confirmation and then buy. In otherwords, the bears who were controlling the
stock were overcome by the bulls, which is
what formed the signal. The confirmation
gave you the trigger and confidence that the
bulls were still in it. After a couple of days,
because of whatsoever reason, there is a

Chunk 2451 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
because of whatsoever reason, there is a
dark candle which takes the stock price back
to the buy point. What does that imply? It
implies that the bulls have lost control to the
bears. This is not what should have
happened after a candlestick buy signal. The
trend should have been reversed. However,
the signals now are telling you that the bears
have been able to drive the price back
through the point where the bulls had
assumed control previously. Why, then,

Chunk 2452 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
assumed control previously. Why, then,
would you want to be long in this “bear-
controlled” stock? As you noticed from thisscenario, a stop loss is not a question of
setting arbitrary percentages. It is analyzing
each situation independently to find the
point where the bulls or bears cede control
to the other.
We will look at some of the common
candlestick signals and how to set stop
losses if these signals fail.Hammer
As shown in Figure 11.1, the bottom of the

Chunk 2453 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
As shown in Figure 11.1, the bottom of the
Hammer is a good support point. The bulls
had shown their dominance at that point,
bringing the prices all the way up. It is quite
logical to assume that if the price drops
below the low of the Hammer, the signal is
negated.
Figure 11.1: Stop out level for a Hammer
signalInverted Hammer
The bottom of the body of the Inverted
Hammer (Figure 11.2) is considered a strong
support area.
Figure 11.2: Stop out level for an Inverted
Hammer signal

Chunk 2454 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Hammer signal
If the price declines below this point, it
shows that the bulls were not able to hold thesupport. Getting out of the trade is then the
prudent thing to do.Bullish Engulfing Signal
As Figure 11.3 shows, the bottom of the
bullish candle is logically analyzed to be a
strong support.
Figure 11.3: Stop out level for a Bullish
Engulfing signal
That is the price at which the bulls started
taking control from the bears. After the signal

Chunk 2455 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
taking control from the bears. After the signal
is confirmed, prices should not get backthrough this point.Piercing Signal
Where did the bulls take control from the
bears in the Piercing signal in Figure 11.4?
Figure 11.4: Stop out level for a Piercing
signal
The bottom of the bullish candle! It then
makes logical sense to put your stop loss just
below (typically 0.1% below) this price
point. The piercing signal is considerednegated if prices come back down through
this point.Bullish Harami

Chunk 2456 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
this point.Bullish Harami
In the case of a Bullish Harami, the logical
point to set the stop loss is just below the
bottom of the bullish candle as shown in
Figure 11.5. The bulls had assumed control
at that point and should not be letting the
price slip below that.
Figure 11.5: Stop out level for a Bullish
Harami signalMorning Star Signal
Figure 11.6 shows a Morning Star stop loss
scenario.
Figure 11.6: Stop out level for a Morning
Star signal
As long as the price does not trade below the

Chunk 2457 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
As long as the price does not trade below the
low of the signal formation, the bulls are still
in control. The Morning Star signal is very
powerful and rarely will one fail. But atrader should be aware of the stop loss
setting just in case it were to happen.Hanging Man Signal
As shown in Figure 11.7, the top of the
Hanging Man signal is considered resistance.
This is because the bears had seized control
from the bulls at that price. If the bulls can
take the price above the body of the Hanging

Chunk 2458 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
take the price above the body of the Hanging
Man, the signal is considered failed.
Figure 11.7: Stop out level for a Hanging
Man signalShooting Star Signal
Figure 11.8 shows the stop loss setting for a
Shooting Star.
Figure 11.8: Stop out level for a Shooting
Star signal
If you go short on a confirmed Shooting Star
signal, get out immediately if the bulls
manage to trade the stock above the high
point. That piercing of the high point showsstrength on the part of bulls, something you

Chunk 2459 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
as a short seller don’t want to see!Bearish Engulfing Signal
The bulls would be considered in charge of
the stock again, if they can manage to close
prices above the body of the dark candle as
shown in Figure 11.9. As a short seller, you
do not want to be in this trade anymore.
Figure 11.9: Stop out level for a Bearish
Engulfing signalDark Cloud Cover
It is recommended to set your stop loss just
above the open of the dark candle of the
Dark Cloud Cover in Figure 11.10. That is

Chunk 2460 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Dark Cloud Cover in Figure 11.10. That is
the point where the bears seized control from
the bulls previously. Prices trading above
this point will negate this signal.
Figure 11.10: Stop out level for a DarkCloud signalBearish Harami Signal
As shown in Figure 11.11, the open of the
dark candle is resistance. It is recommended
to place a stop just above this level. The
bulls are assumed to be still in control if
prices trade above this point.

Figure 11.11: Stop out level for a Bearish
Harami signalEvening Star Signal
Figure 11.12 shows an Evening Star signal
stop loss scenario. The high of the Evening
Star is a logical resistance point. Placing a
stop loss just above this point would allow
the candlestick trader to get out with only a
small loss.
Figure 11.12: Stop out level for an
Evening Star signal
The key point is to analyze what price actionis shown by the signals once you have
entered the market. The price action should

Chunk 2462 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
entered the market. The price action should
follow your expected path. This analysis
should be done daily for all the positions
held in the account. It should not take too
much time to do this analysis once your eyes
are trained and the signals are properly
understood. That is the reason I have
emphasized the importance of understanding
the psychology behind the candlestick
signals.
Figure 11.13 shows the chart of Jaiprakash
Associates.Figure 11.13: Failed Bullish Harami

Chunk 2463 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Associates.Figure 11.13: Failed Bullish Harami
You can notice in this chart that the first
Bullish Harami would have given the trader
a small loss. The trader should have got out
as soon as the bears drove the prices below
the open of the white Harami candle. A
couple of days later, the trader should havegot back in on another Bullish Harami signal.
This trade would have made a very good
profit. You have to cut your losses short and
let your profits run!

Chunk 2464 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
let your profits run!
Some of you might be thinking — Why did I
need the stop loss? Even if I would have
held on after the failure of the first Bullish
Harami, I would have not had much loss. The
stock eventually rebounded.
Yes, you are correct that the stock
rebounded. But would you have known that
when the stock came down through the open
of the Harami? How would you have known
the extent of the downward slide from that
point on? In reality, there is no way to know

point on? In reality, there is no way to know
that. Hindsight is always 20 / 20. Then whyrisk your money. Take the small loss and find
another high probability signal. If you like
this stock, then keep monitoring it. You have
already witnessed one buy signal. The
stochastics are oversold. Just wait for
another buy signal. You would have been
handsomely rewarded in this case if you
would have entered on the second buy signal.

Grasim
If a candlestick trader had bought this stock
on 27 February 2007, right after the Bullish
Harami in oversold condition, s/he would
have been following the rules. The
probabilities indicated that the Harami might
have stopped the selling and the gap up nextday might have indicated some bullish
sentiment. However, the trader should have
sold out as soon as the stock breached and

Chunk 2467 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
sold out as soon as the stock breached and
closed lower than the open of the Harami
day. The probabilities were no longer in his
or her favour. The stock can go down 10
more points from here, or 50 more points.
Always trade with the probabilities!

At the beginning of July 2006, we notice a
bullish Harami Doji being formed. The next
day there is confirmation buying (Point 1).

Chunk 2468 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
day there is confirmation buying (Point 1).
The candlestick trader would get in at this
point. There were two more conditionswhich made this a good buy point:
1. Stochastics were in an oversold
condition; and
2. The bullish Harami Doji formed near the
same level where the stock found support
in mid-June 2006.
As you can see from the chart, things did not
go as anticipated. The candlestick trader
should have sold out his position as soon as
it closed below the bottom of the Harami

Chunk 2469 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
it closed below the bottom of the Harami
(Point 2). Getting in the stock again after the
Bullish Engulfing signal (Point 3), would
have yielded a very profitable subsequent
trade.
Figure 11.16 shows the chart of L&T Ltd.Figure 11.16: Resistance becomes support
in L&T
The Bearish Engulfing signal at the beginning
of November (Point 1) was an excellent
point to short sell the stock. The stochastics
were in over bought conditions and thesignal confirmed a previous resistance point

Chunk 2470 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
from mid-September. Let us analyze what
happened from then on:
A Morning Star signal stopped the
downtrend. The trader would still be
okay at this point.
We then witnessed a Doji, then a
Spinning Top, another Doji and another
Spinning Top. All these indecisive days
occurred at the same resistance level.
Then a Shooting Star was formed. At this
point the candlestick trader should be
comfortable that the bears are not giving
up on the stock. Though the bears are not

Chunk 2471 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
up on the stock. Though the bears are not
too forceful in driving the prices lower,
they are still the dominant party.The trader would then have witnessed
the big dark candle confirming the
Shooting Star. Everything is still
implying that the supply exceeds the
demand at around the ` 1,360 price range.
Then we see a Bullish Harami occur. No
reason to panic yet. The trader is still in
the trade.
The next day prices gap up over the
resistance area indicating a change in

Chunk 2472 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
resistance area indicating a change in
investor sentiment. This is not what the
stock should have been doing if the bears
were still in control. It’s time, therefore,
for the trader to get out. The market has
handed over control to the bulls.

You will notice that a bullish Harami formed
at the beginning of December 2006.
Stochastics were in oversold conditions. The

Chunk 2473 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Stochastics were in oversold conditions. The
next day provided confirmation buying for
the candlestick trader to get in. What shouldbe expected after that? Continued buying!
However the trade fizzled out and the trader
should have been stopped out as shown in
the chart.
I would like to ask you to look at the chart in
Figure 11.17 again in a different perspective.
Should you have even made this trade?
Analyze the chart thoroughly. I have defined
the “buy point” and the “stop out point”

Chunk 2474 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
the “buy point” and the “stop out point”
earlier. What is the target point in this case?
Where do you expect the stock to reach?
Hint: Use concepts from the previous
chapter.
Figure 11.18 is the same as Figure 11.17, but
with the target point.Figure 11.18: Re-visiting the previous
trade with technical analysis
The target point in this case is the extension
of the old support line. Notice the Head and
Shoulders formation beginning in October
and lasting till the end of November. The

Chunk 2475 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
and lasting till the end of November. The
market broke the neck-line and then tried torally back above it, but failed.
So the candlestick trader, upon seeing the
buy scenario, should have waited to get into
the market until the new resistance was
successfully breached to the upside.
Otherwise the reward-risk ratio (described
in the next section of this chapter) did not
warrant the trade.
Also notice the stock failing to breach the
resistance in January 2007.

Chunk 2476 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
resistance in January 2007.
As emphasized in the previous chapter, the
concepts that “old resistance becomes new
support once breached” and “old support
becomes new resistance once breached” are
a very powerful tool in the trader’s arsenal.Hopefully, by now you have gained some
confidence in the stop loss procedures using
candlestick signals. Remember that the
signals convey all the information you need
to take a logical decision.Trading Tips from a Candlestick
Trader’s Perspective

Chunk 2477 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Trader’s Perspective
This section will detail some of the nuances
that will help you improve your trading one
notch further. These are not hard and fast
rules, but a collection of my trading
guidelines. Some have been learnt from
observation and others of a trade from actual
trading experience.Always Work Out the Risk-Reward
Ratio
If you have read any trading book, you know
of the three basic price points you need to be
aware of even before placing the trade:

Chunk 2478 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
aware of even before placing the trade:
The entry point — this is the point to
buy after a confirmed candlestick signal.
The stop loss point — this is the point to
exit the trade if the stock is not
performing as expected.
The target point — this is the point
where you expect the stock to reach if the
trade is successful, usually a previous
high or perceived resistance level.These points help you define the “reward to
risk ratio” as follows:
The higher the reward-risk ratio, the more

Chunk 2479 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
The higher the reward-risk ratio, the more
compelling is the trade. Traders normally
like to have at least a reward-risk ratio of 2,
or higher. Personally, I like to see 3 or
higher. You will have to decide what ratio
you are comfortable with.
Just because you notice an excellent
candlestick buy signal does not mean you
have to enter the trade. Always calculate the
reward-risk ratio. If you could lose ` 10 for a

Chunk 2480 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
reward-risk ratio. If you could lose ` 10 for a
possible gain of ` 15, the trade is not worthit, no matter how good the candlestick signal.Don’t Turn a Trade into an
Investment
This is the most common mistake committed
by traders. They see a good buy situation
setting up. They notice the stochastics are
oversold and can sense panic selling in the
market. Then the buy signal is formed. They
know their entry point, their target point and
also their stop loss point. They enter the

Chunk 2481 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
also their stop loss point. They enter the
market feeling confident that the trend has
reversed. The stock moves up as expected.
The traders are happy. Everything is good
and rosy. Soon, however, the stock starts
dropping. The bears start taking control of
the stock and push it down past through the
stop loss point. The trader hesitates at thiscritical juncture. Something inside his mind
knows, now is the time to sell and accept the
loss. But, then, hope crawls in. Hope, that

Chunk 2482 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
loss. But, then, hope crawls in. Hope, that
ultimate trickster! The trader convinces
himself that the stock will rebound anytime
now. He promises to himself to get out as
soon as the stock comes to break even. Alas,
the market is unforgiving to such “weak
hearted” traders. By the end of the day, the
stock is down considerably. This leads to the
biggest mistake of all. Now the trader
convinces himself that the company whose
stock he just bought is fundamentally very

Chunk 2483 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
stock he just bought is fundamentally very
sound. The prospects for the company are
great. He will keep holding and buying more,
so he can average out the price.
The problem with this scenario is multifold:The trader has no inkling how far down
the stock is going to go. So his portfolio
is not under his control anymore.
His money is now tied into an
“investment” which is losing its value.
He is losing other valuable opportunities
by not having that money at his disposal,
and, most importantly,

Chunk 2484 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
and, most importantly,
He is mentally shaken and his confidence
rattled by watching his portfolio go
down.
Do not turn your losing trades into a long
term investment. Get out if the candlestick
signals fail and wait for another buy
opportunity.Avoid Trading Low Volume Stocks
Candlestick signals indicate the sum total of
all the investment knowledge of the traders
in that particular stock. The larger the
number of traders participating in the stock,
the better is the signal. High volume stocks

Chunk 2485 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
the better is the signal. High volume stocks
are better to trade using candlesticks than
very low volume stocks. Figure 11.19 shows
a chart of ACE India Ltd.Figure 11.19: Avoid these kind of low
volume stocks
This is not a good chart to trade from. As a
candlestick trader, you want the chart to be
clean. Look at previous reversal points on
the chart. Usually, if a chart has given good
signals in the past, it will give good signalsin the future. If you find a chart which is

Chunk 2486 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
difficult to analyze, skip it. There are plenty
of other charts to play with. Always get all
the variables in your favour before you step
into a trade.Avoid Taking a Position before
Earnings Reports
As a candlestick trader, you are relying on
the signals on the chart. This is, by
definition, technical trading. You do not want
to engage yourself in fundamental decision
making processes. When fundamental news
hits the wires, technicals will take a
backseat. Earnings declarations are one of

Chunk 2487 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
backseat. Earnings declarations are one of
the fundamental news a trader needs to stay
away from. It is highly recommended to not
have a position in a company which is about
to declare its earnings. It is just not worth it.
You can employ various hedging positions,
but that is beyond the scope of this book. If
you are in a stock whose earnings arescheduled to be released after the bell, exit
the position during the day. This does not
mean that you should not trade during

Chunk 2488 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
mean that you should not trade during
earnings season every quarter. Just make sure
you exit the position before earnings are
released. There are many other opportunities
in the market to trade from. As a candlestick
trader, you can watch what candle formations
occur after the earnings news is released and
then take a decision to go long or short.
Similar fundamental news, such as a drug
approval decision, a huge contract decision,
takeover speculation, etc., should be treated

Chunk 2489 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
takeover speculation, etc., should be treated
the same way. Always keep in mind that you
are a trader, not a gambler. Any trading
situation in which a news outcome can
completely disrupt your rationale for
entering a position should be avoided. Icannot emphasize this enough.Don’t be Trigger-Shy
Many traders experience hesitation in
entering the market at the right time even
after an excellent signal appears. This
happens primarily because of a lack of
confidence in one’s trading skills. Such

Chunk 2490 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
confidence in one’s trading skills. Such
traders come up with different excuses as to
why they should not trade “this time”.
How many of the following excuses have you
given yourself?
The signal is good but somebody in the
online chat group said not to buy this
stock.
Let me paper trade just this one moretime. I will buy from the next time
onwards.
Analysts on TV and newspapers are
saying the market will go down now. So I
will pass this good buy signal.
Even though I can see a sell signal,

Chunk 2491 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Even though I can see a sell signal,
everyone else is buying. The signal might
be wrong. Let me pass this trade.
I am not wearing my favourite coloured
shirt, my hair is not combed, my makeup
today is not good, and so on.
You get the point!
As a candlestick trader, you have centuries
of testing backing you up. You understand the
psychology behind the formations. You arenow able to see the market from the greed
and fear perspective. You have confidence
that the signals represent high probability

Chunk 2492 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
that the signals represent high probability
reversal situations. You are also aware that
should the signal go sour, you have decided
the precise point to get out with a small loss.
Trade confidently. You have to start.
Otherwise, you cannot win.Don’t Target Buying Exact Tops and
Selling Exact Bottoms
As a candlestick trader, you should not be
concerned with buying at the exact bottom or
selling at the exact top. That is a very
difficult task compared to taking the chunk of

Chunk 2493 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
difficult task compared to taking the chunk of
the trend in between the top and the bottom.
Some traders see a good bullish engulfing
signal, prepare to buy on confirmation, but
never do. They lament about not getting in at
the bottom of the long engulfing candle. They
do not look at the trend reversal and the fact
that the stock can now give them a good up
trend.
As a candlestick trader, you will only buy onconfirmation of the signal. You will only sell

Chunk 2494 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
or short on confirmation of a sell signal.
Nothing else matters.Overbought and Oversold Conditions
are Secondary to Candlestick Signals
We have used stochastics throughout the
book to indicate overbought and oversold
conditions. These are to be used only as
indicators. The over-riding factor in any
buying or selling decision should be the
candlestick signal.
If you bought a stock on a buy signal when
stochastics were in oversold conditions, then
you will sell only when you analyze that the

Chunk 2495 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
you will sell only when you analyze that the
bears have taken control. Just because the
stock has become overbought should not in
itself mean anything to you. A stock, or any
market for that matter, can stay overboughtfor weeks or even months. Similarly, a stock
or a market can stay oversold for a long time.
This happens when the stock or market is in
a trend. The trend channel, as described in
the previous chapter, becomes the support
and resistance for the stock. If the stock is in

Chunk 2496 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
and resistance for the stock. If the stock is in
an up trend, it might not get to oversold
conditions till the time it moves from the
upper trend line to the lower trend line.
Now, in such trending stocks you need to
decide if you want to get out on a sell signal
at the top of the trend and buy again when it
gets to the bottom, or just keep holding the
stock until it breaks the up-trending channel.
This is a personal matter of choice.The Trend is Your Friend

Chunk 2497 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
“The trend is your friend” is another adage in
the stock trading world, which every trader
should make use of in his trading. What this
implies in simple terms is that a trader
should trade only in the direction of the
trend:
If a stock is trending up, then only buy on
candlestick buy signals and sell out on
sell signals. Do not short sell on a sell
signal.
If a stock is trending down, then short
sell on a candlestick sell signal and buy
back on a buy signal. But do not buy

Chunk 2498 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
back on a buy signal. But do not buy
long.Imagine the market to be like a flowing river.
If the river is flowing upstream, then why
would you want to swim downstream,
against the current? Use the strength of the
current to your advantage. Swim upstream.
So, too, with the markets. In an up trending
stock, always buy on a candlestick buy
signal. You can sell out when a sell signal
appears to protect your profits. But shorting
the stock is not advisable because the weight

Chunk 2499 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
the stock is not advisable because the weight
of the market is against you. When the stock
breaks the up trend line, a new dynamic is
generated. Use the candlestick signals to
short the stock at the right time.Targets are Only Targets
When you decide to enter a trade, you have a
certain target in mind that you analyze the
stock should be able to reach. You will take
your profits at that point if the signals tell
you to. This target point could be either:
A previous major high or low;

Chunk 2500 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
A previous major high or low;
A major trend line;
A Fibonacci re-tracement level; or
A major moving average.
That is all very good. You have taken all the
steps a trader needs to take before entering a
trade. However, you must realize that themarket does not care who is trading it, what
price level you entered at, or what price
level is your target. That is all in your head.
Those are parameters you have decided for
your trade. It can very well happen that after

Chunk 2501 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
your trade. It can very well happen that after
you buy a stock, it goes up, but forms a
candlestick sell signal before reaching your
target. Please take profits. The markets are
sending you a signal. Ignore it at your own
risk. Targets are just that, targets. Nothing
more! The signal is the over-riding factor.
If you see the stock climb back up after you
sold on a sell signal, do not fret about it. You
made a good trade and, more importantly,
you abided by your rules. This will ensure

Paralysis
There are over a hundred technical
indicators which traders can use to help them
decipher which way a stock is heading.
Online charting has helped revolutionize
technical trading. Traders can now program
their own indicators and back-test them on
different stocks. That shows them how
accurate the indicators have performed in the
past. They can then tweak the parameters

Chunk 2503 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
past. They can then tweak the parameters
which define the indicators and try to make
them as accurate as possible. Technical
traders take great pride in doing these
exercises. However, many a time traders
face the “analysis paralysis” phenomenon.They have too many indicators and
oscillators on the chart. This crowds the
price action of the signal leading to
indecision. Your goal as a trader is to
identify the best possible support and
resistance levels for the stock and act

Chunk 2504 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
resistance levels for the stock and act
accordingly. If you have five different
moving averages, Fibonacci re-tracement
levels, support-resistance lines, along with
stochastics, MACD, RSI, volume, on balance
volume and a few other oscillators set up on
the chart, it is going to get very confusing.
The trader will never enter a trade if there
are too many price points which could act as
resistance or support, whichever the case
may be. Let the chart be clear. Pick your

may be. Let the chart be clear. Pick your
favourite oscillator, a couple of moving
averages and your trend lines.You should also be aware that different
oscillators will show oversold and
overbought conditions at different times. One
oscillator might suggest that the stock is still
heading down while another might suggest it
has bottomed. This again will lead to
indecision on the part of traders as they will

Diversification is an important tool for
traders as well as investors. If you have ` 10
lakh in your portfolio, please do not use the
entire amount to invest or trade shares of just
one company. That would be suicidal. A lot
of traders and investors have been burnt
because of lack of diversification. Any

attention to it.
The following is an example of how I would
build a portfolio with ` 10 lakh of capital.
Let me emphasize — this is just an example.You will have to decide what suits you and
your trading style.
I would divide the capital into 10 parts,
giving me ` 1 lakh each for ten trades. I

Chunk 2508 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):

If the share price of a company is ` 50, I
would buy 2,000 shares. If the share price is
` 500, I would only buy 200. This is to make
sure I only use ` 1 lakh for each trade.
This keeps emotional buying out of a trade.
Sometimes traders see an excellent buy
signal in perfect conditions. They are sure
beyond any doubt that this will be a winningtrade. So they buy more shares for this

Chunk 2509 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
position. Unfortunately, if the trade goes the
other way, they will be sitting on a much
higher loss than should have been the case.

probabilities! Think of every trade as having
the same probability of success. Do not
favour one trade over the other.

Candlesticks for Longer Term
TradingTrading for the “Not-So-Active”

Candlesticks work very well for investing

They want to participate in wealth building
through financial instruments on a long term

Chunk 2513 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
displayed on weekly time frame. Most
charting services will allow you to display a
chart in a daily, weekly or monthly time
frame. You may have noticed that most of this
book uses daily charts. However, candlestick
signals work just the same way on a weekly
chart or on a monthly chart. Nothing changes.
The signal formations and the psychology
behind them are exactly the same. For a
weekly chart, the candle opens at the start of
the trading week and closes at the end of the

Chunk 2514 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
the trading week and closes at the end of the
trading week. For a monthly candlestick
chart, the candle opens at the start of the
month and closes at the end of the month. For
a weekly chart, the high and the low of thecandle are the highest price the stock reached
in that week and the lowest price the stock
reached in that week, respectively. For the
monthly chart, the high and low are the
highest price the stock reached in the month
and the lowest price the stock reached in the

Chunk 2515 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
and the lowest price the stock reached in the
month, respectively.
In general, if you are using weekly charts,
you would expect to be in the market for
weeks, or maybe even months, at a time.
Your gains will be much higher than if you
were trading the daily charts. On the flip
side, if a signal faults out, you will not know
of it until the end of the week when the
candle closes. That would translate into a
higher loss. But remember, again, the

Chunk 2516 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
higher loss. But remember, again, the
probabilities are on your side when you buyand sell on a candlestick signal.
Figure 12.1 shows the weekly chart of Bank
of India.
Figure 12.1: Morning Star in Bank of India
with stochastics oversoldAfter weeks of selling and domination by the
bears, the stock formed a Morning Star
reversal signal. Also notice that the
stochastics were in oversold conditions. The
perfect time to buy would have been in the
week after the week of the Morning Star
signal.

Chunk 2517 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
week after the week of the Morning Star
signal.
As I mentioned before, none of the procedure
for buying or selling changes when using
weekly charts. The only change is the time
frame of trading. The trader or investor using
this chart would have stayed in the position
for at least 2 months before exiting.

Syndicate Bank.Figure 12.2: Evening Star signal starts the

Chunk 2518 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
In the early part of May 2006, you will
notice an Evening Star formation. Long term
traders could have put on short positions as
soon as the signal got confirmed. The
downtrend was stopped by a Doji-typeweek, followed by a Bullish Engulfing
signal.
Figure 12.3 shows the Nifty index plotted
with a weekly time frame.

Nifty weekly chartThis chart is proof that candlesticks work
very well for indexes on a weekly time

Chunk 2519 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
very well for indexes on a weekly time
frame, just like they do on daily time frames.
Notice the following points about the chart:
Point 1: An Evening Star signal stopped
Nifty’s advance at the beginning of
October 2005.
Pont 2: A bullish Harami signal ended the
short downtrend in November 2005.
Point 3: The Nifty had a very good run till
May 2006, where an ugly Evening
Star formation broke its trend.
Point 4: This particular downtrend was
broken in June 2006 by a Morning

Chunk 2520 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
broken in June 2006 by a Morning
Star signal.Point 5: In February 2007 you can witness a
Doji type week, followed by a
Hanging Man signal.
Figure 12.4 shows the weekly chart of
Jaiprakash Associates. Notice the strong up
trend till ` 500 was broken with the
formation of a Bearish Harami. The chart
also points out a Bearish Engulfing signal
prior to where the up trend reversed. At this
point, and ask yourself, if one should have
shorted the stock? Looking at the chart it is

Chunk 2521 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
shorted the stock? Looking at the chart it is
obvious that you should not have. What is the
significant difference between the Bearish
Harami and the Bearish Engulfing on this
chart? Confirmation of the candlestick
signal!Figure 12.4: Bearish Engulfing signal
topples Jaiprakash Associates
It is very important for any candlestick signal
to be confirmed before initiating a position.
Notice that the Bearish Engulfing signal was
negated with a Bullish Harami formation.

Chunk 2522 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
negated with a Bullish Harami formation.
The Bearish Harami formation was
confirmed with another bearish candle and
lower close. This would be the place to goshort anticipating a down move.
Observe the weekly chart of GMR
Infrastructure in Figure 12.5.
Figure 12.5: Trading with candles signals
in the weekly chart of GMR Infrastructure
After a few Spinning Tops and small body
candles throughout March 2007, the stock
formed a Hammer signal. This was

Chunk 2523 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
formed a Hammer signal. This was
confirmed in the next couple of weeksindicating the possible start of an up trend.
This rally ended with a Shooting Star
formation, confirmed by a bearish candle in
the following week. Could this possible
pullback have been anticipated? Maybe.
Where do most investors buy? Near the top!
Notice the candles getting larger as the rally
gained steam and the stock more than tripled.
This is where the common man decides to
jump in so as not to miss the boat. A very

Chunk 2524 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
jump in so as not to miss the boat. A very
good sign that the stock is about to reverse.
One more point to emphasize is that technical
analysis can be applied to weekly charts, just
as it would to daily charts. Support /
resistance lines, trend channels, technical
patterns are formed by repetitive andunchanging human behaviour. Fear is fear
whether on a daily chart. a weekly chart or
even on a 15 minute chart. There is nothing
magical about it. We are prone to act the

magical about it. We are prone to act the
same way, no matter what our trading time
horizon is.
Figure 12.6 shows Infosys Technologies
breaking out of a long downtrend on a
weekly chart. Here are some key points to
observe:
Point 1: An Evening Star formation starts the
downtrend.Figure 12.6: Using support / resistance on
weekly charts
Point 2: A Bullish Harami confirmed the day
after. Would one buy at this point
given the downtrend line resistance
just overhead? That would not be a
good idea.

Chunk 2526 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
just overhead? That would not be a
good idea.
Point 3: A Hammer formation confirmed the
day after. Apply the same logic asPoint 2.
Point 4: A Morning Star signal. There is a
difference this time around. The
investor sentiment has changed to a
point where the stock breaks the
downtrend resistance with a strong
bullish confirmation. A good place to
get in for a trade!
Point 5: An Evening Star signal confirmed
one should get out of the trade.
Point 6: This emphasizes that old resistance

Chunk 2527 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
Point 6: This emphasizes that old resistance
once broken acts as support. A
Morning Star signal at this point
should prompt profit taking on the
short side.Finally, let’s look at a weekly chart of MTNL
in Figure 12.7.
Figure 12.7: Candlestick signals on
MTNL’s weekly chart
The stock had been in an up trend from the
end of July till the start of January. A few
points to notice about the Bearish Haramithat formed at this point:
1. The Harami was confirmed with a
bearish candle the following week;

Chunk 2528 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
bearish candle the following week;
2. The close of this confirming candle was
below the up trend support line; and
3. The volume surged near the peak
indicating last gasp buying from the
bulls. This is a very good indication that
the trend is about to be reversed. It is a
simple point, no more buyers means
lower prices.
For a trader who went short on a break of the
up trend support line, a good place to exit the
position would have been after a string of

Chunk 2529 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
position would have been after a string of
Doji were confirmed with a bullish candle inMarch.
As you can see, the candlestick signals work
the same in all time frames. For those
investors who are seeking to ride the bigger
trends and who do not have the time or
passion to monitor the markets often, using
weekly charts with candlestick signals
would be an ideal scenario. However,
remember that you still need to monitor the
markets once in a week. Spending this time

Chunk 2530 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
markets once in a week. Spending this time
now monitoring your investments will
generate huge rewards later in life.

Conclusion
I have made a sincere effort to write a no-
nonsense book about trading using Japanese
candlestick signals. I wanted to include a lot
of history regarding the signals, but decided
otherwise. The history and the Japanese
nomenclature have no bearing on one’s
trading. The key is to understand the major
signals and use them effectively.

Chunk 2531 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
signals and use them effectively.
I would like to urge readers to re-read the
book until their eyes get visually trained to
recognize the various signal formations. Thisis because the signal recognition process
should be instantaneous. A minute or two can
then be spent analyzing the support-
resistance levels and stop loss levels. Soon
this entire process of finding potential
profitable trades will be second nature to
you. You will instantly know which charts

Chunk 2532 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
you. You will instantly know which charts
look “tradable”. Instead of trying to find
trades in all the charts, your experienced
eyes will visually select the most profitable
opportunities.
As mentioned before, it takes practice,
patience and dedication to become a
successful investor and trader. One of my
early mentors in candlestick trading had a
very good idea about practice trades. He
used to put on his usual 5 to 10 trades at atime. But, along with that, he also used to

Chunk 2533 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
paper trade another 5 to 10 trades. This is an
excellent way to test one’s knowledge and
get to know the market at the same time. If
you involve yourself only in paper trading,
you will be leaving out the key point — your
emotional interaction with the market!
Start your journey with a small, but real
position in the market. Then, as the profits
grow, so can your trade size.
Do not fall prey to those who say you cannot
time the market. With the right knowledge

Chunk 2534 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
time the market. With the right knowledge
and practical money management techniques,
you can reap huge rewards from any
investment instrument. Also remember that
you are not limited to trading only shares anymore. You can use candlestick signals for
trading currencies and commodities as well.
It is up to you to find your niche in the
market. Not all traders like to trade
everything. Some specialize in shares, some
in commodities and some in currencies. You
now have a powerful tool to use in

Chunk 2535 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
now have a powerful tool to use in
whichever market you find comfortable.
From now on, the market will look less
chaotic to you. Though you cannot control the
ups and the downs of the market, you will be
able to take advantage of the swings. I would
highly recommend the readers to get
proficient in playing both sides (long and
short) of the markets. Many traders develop
a liking to trading to only the upside. Some

Chunk 2536 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
a liking to trading to only the upside. Some
are under the wrong impression that shortingstocks is dangerous. With proper stop loss
procedures, the risk in going short is the
same as in going long. Traders who trade
only side miss out when the markets are
correcting, which inevitably happens. There
is no difference as far as candlestick trading
is concerned. This book has thoroughly
discussed the candlestick sell signals and the
readers should take advantage of them. Once

Chunk 2537 (Source: how-to-make-money-trading-with-candlestick-charts-PDFdrive.txt):
readers should take advantage of them. Once
you get fluent playing both sides, there will
never be a dull moment in the market for you.
It is a big world out there with billions of
rupees trading hands every day. It is my
innermost belief that this book can help you
put some of that abundance in your pocket!

 Andrew’s 10 Rules of Day Trading  
Rule 1:  Day trading is not a strategy to get rich quickly.  
Rule 2:  Day trading is not easy. It is a serious business, and 
you should treat it as such.  
Rule 3:  Day traders do not hold positions overnight. If 
necessary, you must sell with a loss to m ake sure you do not 
hold onto any stock overnight.  
Rule 4:  Always ask, “Is this stock moving because the overall

Chunk 2574 (Source: How_to_Day_Trade_for_a_Living-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
market is moving, or is it moving because it has a unique 
fundamental catalyst?”  
Rule 5: Success  in day trading comes from risk management 
- finding low -risk entries with a high potential reward. The 
minimum win:lose ratio for me is 2:1.  
Rule 6:  Your broker will buy and sell stocks for you at the 
Exchange. Your only job as a day trader is to manage risk. 
You cannot be a successful day trader with out excellent risk 
management skills, even if you are the master of many

Chunk 2575 (Source: How_to_Day_Trade_for_a_Living-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
effective strategies.  
Rule 7:  Retail traders trade only Stocks in Play, high relative 
volume stocks that have fundamental catalysts and are being 
traded regardless of the overall mark et. 
Rule 8:  Experienced traders are like guerrilla soldiers. They 
jump out at just the right time, take their profit, and get out.  
Rule 9:  Hollow candlesticks, where the close is greater than 
the open, indicate buying pressure. Filled candlesticks, where

Chunk 2576 (Source: How_to_Day_Trade_for_a_Living-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the close is less than the open, indicate selling pressure.  
Rule 10: Profitable trading does not involve emotion. If you 
are an emotional trader, you will lose your money.

  4Preface  
 
There are some amazing stories here: 
A trader who, after wiping out several times early  in his career, turned a $30,000 account into $80

Chunk 2590 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
million A fund manager who achieved what many t hought impossible—five consecutive years of 
triple-digit percentage returns A trader from sm all-town America who star ted out on a shoestring 
and has become one of the world's largest bond trad ers A former securities analyst who, during the 
past seven years, has realized an average monthly return of 25 percent (over 1,400 percent 
armualized), primarily trading stock index futu res An electrical engineering graduate from МГГ

Chunk 2591 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
whose largely computerized approach to tr ading has earned his accounts an astounding 250,000 
percent return over a sixteen-year period. 
These are but a sampling of the interviews cont ained in this book. In his own way, each of the 
traders interviewed has achieved incredible success. 
What sets these traders apart? Most people think that winning in the markets has something to do 
with finding the secret formula. The truth is  that any common denomin ator among the traders I

Chunk 2592 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
interviewed had more to do with attitude than approach. Some of the traders use fundamental 
analysis exclusively, others empl oy only technical analysis, and still others combine the two. Some 
traders operate on a time horizon measured in hours or even minutes, while others typically 
implement positions that they intend to hold for months or even years. Although the trading 
methodologies varied widely, the forthcoming interv iews reveal certain im portant commonalities in

Chunk 2593 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trading attitudes and principles. 
Trading provides one of the last great frontiers of  opportunity in our economy. It is one of the very 
few ways in which an individual can start with a relatively small bankroll and actually become a 
multimillionaire. Of course, only a handful of individuals (such as those interviewed here) succeed 
in turning this feat, but at least the opportunity exists. 
While I hardly expect all readers of this book to  transform themselves into super-traders—the

Chunk 2594 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
world just doesn't work that way—I believe that  these thought-provoking inte rviews will help most 
serious and open-minded readers improve their pers onal trading performance. It may even help a 
select few become super-traders.

  5Acknowledgments  
First and foremost, I would like to  thank Stephen Chronowitz, who por ed over every chapter in this

Chunk 2595 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
book and provided a multitude of helpful suggestions  and editing changes. I am indebted to Steve 
for both the quantity (hours) and quality of his input. I truly believe that whatever the merits of this 
work, it has benefited significan tly from his contributions. 
I am grateful to my wife, Jo Arm, not only for enduring nine months as a "book widow," but also 
for being a valuable sounding board—a role she performed with brutal honesty. Sample: "This is

Chunk 2596 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the worst thing you ever wrote!" (Needless to say, that item was excised from the book.) Jo Arm 
possesses common sense in abundance, and I us ually followed her advice unquestioningly. 
Of course, I would like to expre ss my thanks to all the traders who agreed to be interviewed, 
without whom there would be no book. By and larg e, these traders neither need nor seek publicity, 
as they trade only for their own accounts or are already managing al l the money they wish to. In

Chunk 2597 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
many cases, their motives for participating were altr uistic. For example, as one trader expressed it, 
"When I was starting out, I found biographies and interviews of successful  traders particularly 
helpful, and I would like to play a similar role in helping new traders." 
I wish to express my sincere appreciation to El aine Crocker for her friendly persuasion, which 
made some of the chapters in th is book possible. For advice, lead s, and other assorted favors, I

Chunk 2598 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
would like to thank Courtney Smith, Norm Zadeh, Susan Abbott, Bruce Babcock, Martin Presler, 
Chuck Carlson, Leigh Stevens, Brian Gelber, Michael Marcus, and William Rafter. Finally, I 
would like to thank three traders who were graci ous enough to grant me lengthy interviews, which 
were not incorporated in to this book: Irv Kessler, Doug Redm ond, and Martin Presler (the former 
two because, in retrospect, I considered my line of  questioning too esoteric and technical; the latter

Chunk 2599 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
because publication deadlines did not permit time for needed follow-up interviews and editing). 
  6Prologue  
The name of the book was The Big Board. . . . It was about an Eart h-ling man and woman who 
were kidnapped by extraterrestrial s. They were put on display in a zoo on a planet called Zircon-

These fictitious people in the zoo had a big board  supposedly showing stock market quotations and

supposedly connected to a brokerage on Earth. The cr eatures on Zircon-212 told  their captives that 
they had invested a million dollars for them back  on Earth, and that it was up to the captives to 
manage it so that they would be fabulously we althy when they were returned to Earth. 
The telephone and the big board and the ticker we re all fakes, of course. They were simply

up and down and cheer, or gloat, or sulk, or tear th eir hair, to be scared shitless or to feel as 
contented as babies in their mothers' arms. 
The Earthlings did very well on paper. That was part of the rigging, of course. And religion got 
mixed up in it, too. The news ticker reminded them  that the President of the United States had

declared National Prayer Week, and that ever ybody should pray. The Earthlings had had a bad 
week on the market before that. They had lost a sm all fortune in olive oil futures. So they gave 
praying a whirl. It worked. Olive oil went up.

If the random walk theorists are correct, then Earthbound traders are suffering from the same 
delusions as the zoo inhabitants of Kilgore Trout's novel. (Kilgore Trout is the ubiquitous science

Chunk 2603 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
fiction writer in Kurt Vonnegut 's novels.) Whereas the prisoners  on Zircon-212 thought their 
decisions were being based on actual price quotes —they were not—real-life traders believe they 
can beat the market by their acumen or skill. If markets are truly efficient and random in every time 
span, then these traders are attri buting their success or failure to their own skills or shortcomings, 
when in reality it is all a matter of luck.

After interviewing the traders for this book, it is hard to believe th is view of the world. One comes 
away with a strong belief that it is highly unlikely that some trader s can win with such consistency 
over vast numbers of trades and many years. Of  course, given enough trader s, some will come out 
ahead even after a long period of ti me, simply as a consequence of the laws of probability. I leave it

Chunk 2605 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
for the mathematicians to determine the odds of traders winning by the magn itude and duration that 
those interviewed here have. Inci dentally, the traders themselves have not a glimmer of doubt that, 
over the long run, the question of who wins and who loses is determined by skill, not luck. I, too, 
share this conviction.  7My Own Story  
Right out of graduate school, I la nded a job as a commodity resear ch analyst. I was pleasantly

Chunk 2606 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
surprised to find that my economic  and statistical analysis correc tly predicted a number of major 
commodity price moves. It was not long thereafte r that the thought of tr ading came to mind. The 
only problem was that my departme nt generally did not permit analysts to trade. I discussed my 
frustration over this situation w ith Michael Marcus (first interv iew), with whom I became friends 
while interviewing for the research position he was vacating. Michael said, "You know, I had the

Chunk 2607 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
same problem when I worked th ere. You should do what I did—open an account at another firm." 
He introduced me to a broker at his ne w firm, who was willing to open the account. 
At the time, I was earning less than  the department secretary, so I didn't exactly have much risk 
capital. I had my brother open a $2,000 account for wh ich I acted as an advisor. Since the account 
had to be kept secret, I could not call in any orders from my desk. Every time I wanted to initiate or

Chunk 2608 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
liquidate a position, I had to take the elevator to  the building's basement to use the public phone. 
(Marcus' solution to the same problem is discussed in his interview.) The worst part of the situation 
was not merely the delays in order entry, which we re often nerve-wracking, but  the fact that I had 
to be very circumspect about the number of times  I left my desk. Sometimes, I would decide to 
delay an order until the following morning in  order to avoid «rearing any suspicion.

Chunk 2609 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I don't remember any specifics about my first few trad es. All I recall is that, on balance, I did only a 
little better than break even after paying commissions . Then came the first trade that made a lasting 
impression. I had done a very deta iled analysis of th e cotton market throughout the entire post-
World War П period. I discovered that because of a va riety of government s upport programs, only 
two seasons since 1953 could truly be termed free markets [markets in which prices were

Chunk 2610 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
determined by supply and demand rather than the prevailing gove rnment program]. I correctly 
concluded that only these two seas ons could be used in forecasting prices. Unfortunately, I failed to 
reach the more significant conclusion that existi ng data were insufficient to permit a meaningful 
market analysis. Based on a comparison with these two seasons, I inferred th at cotton prices, which 
were then trading at 25 cen ts per pound, would move higher, but peak around 32-33 cents.

Chunk 2611 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The initial part of the forecast proved correct as cotton prices e dged higher over a period of months. 
Then the advance accelerated and cotton jumped from 28 to 31 cents in a single week. This latest 
rally was attributed to some news I considered rather unimportant. "Close enough to my projected 
top," I thought, and I decided to go short. Thereafter, the market moved sli ghtly higher and then

Chunk 2612 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
quickly broke back to the 29-cent level. This seemed  perfectly natural to me, as I expected markets 
to conform to my analysis. My profits and elation were  short-lived, however, as cotton prices soon 
rebounded to new highs and then moved unrelentingly higher: 32 cents, 33 cents, 34 cents, 35 
cents. Finally, with my account equity wiped out, I was forced to liquidate the position. Not having 
much money in those days may have been one of  my luckiest breaks, since cotton eventually

Chunk 2613 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
soared to an incredible level of 99 cents—more than double the century's previous high price! 
That trade knocked me out of the box for a while. Ov er the next few years, I again tried my hand at 
trading a couple of times. In each instance, I started with not much more than $2,000 and 
eventually wiped out because of a single large loss.  My only consolation was that the amounts I lost 
were relatively small.

Chunk 2614 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
were relatively small. 
Two things finally broke this pa ttern of failure. First, I met Steve Chronowitz. At the time, I was 
the commodity research director at  Hornblower & Weeks, and I hire d Steve to fill a slot as the 
department's precious metals analyst. Steve and I shared the same office, and we quickly became 
good friends. In contrast to myself, a pure fundamen tal analyst, Steve' s approach to the markets

Chunk 2615 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
was strictly technical. (The funda mental analyst uses economic data  to forecast prices, while the 
technical analyst employs internal  market data—such as price, vo lume, and sentiment—to project 
prices.) 
Until that time, I had viewed technical analysis with great skepticism. I tended to doubt that 
anything as simple as chart reading could be of any value. Working closely with Steve, however, I

Chunk 2616 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
began to notice that his market calls were ofte n right. Eventually, I became convinced that my 
initial assessment of technical an alysis was wrong. I realized that, at least for myself, fundamental 
analysis alone was insufficient for successful trad ing; I also needed to incorporate technical  8analysis for the timing of trades. 
The second key element that finally put me into th e winner's column was the realization that risk

Chunk 2617 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
control was absolutely essential to successful tr ading. I decided that I would never again allow 
myself to lose everything on a single trade—no matter how convinced I wa s of my market view. 
Ironically, the trade that I consider  my turning point and one of my best trades ever was actually a 
loss. At the time, the Deutsche mark had carved out a lengthy trading range following an extended 
decline. Based on my market anal ysis, I believed that the Deutsche mark was forming an important

Chunk 2618 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
price base. I went long within the consolidation,  simultaneously placing a good-till-cancelled stop 
order just below the recent low. I reasoned that if I was right, the market should not fall to new 
lows. Several days later, the market started fa lling and I was stopped out of my position at a small 
loss. The great thing was that after I was stoppe d out, the market plummeted like a stone. In the 
past, this type of trade would have wiped me out; instead, I suffered only a minor loss.

Chunk 2619 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Not long thereafter, I became bullish on the Japanese  yen, which had formed a technically bullish 
consolidation, providing a meani ngful close point to place a protective stop. While I normally 
implemented only a one-contract pos ition, the fact that I felt reasonably able to define my risk at 
only 15 ticks per contract—t oday, I find it hard to believe that I was able to get away with that 
close a stop—allowed me to put on a three-c ontract position. The market never looked back.

Chunk 2620 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Although I ended up getting out of that position far too early, I held one of  the contracts long 
enough to triple my small account size. That was the start of my success at trading. Over the next 
few years, the synthesis of technical and fundament al analysis combined with risk control allowed 
me to build my small stake into well over $100,000. 
Then the streak ended. I found myse lf trading more impulsively, fa iling to follow the rules I had

Chunk 2621 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
learned. In retrospect, I believe I had just become too cocky. In particular, I remember a losing 
trade in soybeans. Instead of taking my loss when the market moved against me, I was so 
convinced that the decline was a reaction in a bull market that I substantially increased my position. 
The mistake was compounded by taking this action in  front of an important government crop 
report. The report came out bearish, and my equity took a dramatic decline. In a matter of days, I

Chunk 2622 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
had surrendered over one-quarter  of my cumulative profits. 
After cashing in my chips to buy a house and la ter taking a yearlong sabba tical to write a book,* 
my savings were sufficiently depleted  to defer my reentry into tradin g for nearly five years. When I 
began trading again, typical to my usual custom, I started with a small amount: $8,000. Most of this 
money was lost over the course of a year. I added another $8,000 to the account and, after some

Chunk 2623 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
further moderate setbacks, eventually scored a few big winning trades. Within about two years, I 
had once again built my trading account up to over $100,000. I subsequently stalled out, and during 
the past year, my account equity has fluctuated below this peak. 
Although, objectively, my trading has been successful, on an emotional level, I often view it with a 
sense of failure. Basically, I feel that given my  market knowledge and experience, I should have

Chunk 2624 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
done better. "Why," I ask myself, "have I been ab le to multiply a sub-$ 10,000 account more than 
tenfold on two occasions, yet unable to expand the equity much beyond that level, let alone by any 
multiples?" 
A desire to find the answers was one  of my motivations for writing this book. I wanted to ask those 
traders who had already succeeded: What are the key elements to your success? What approach do

Chunk 2625 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
you use in the markets? What trading rules do you adhere to? What were your own early trading 
experiences? What advice would you give to other traders? 
While, on one level, my search for answers was a personal quest to help surpass my own barriers, 
in a broader sense, I saw myself as Everyman, asking the questions I thought others would ask if 
given the opportunity.

  10Taking the Mystery Out of Futures 
Of all the markets discussed in this book, the future s market is probably th e one least understood by 
most investors. It is also one of the fastest growing. Trading volume in futures has expanded more 
than twentyfold during the past twenty years. In 1988, the dollar value of all futures contracts

Chunk 2627 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
traded in the U.S. exceeded $10 tr illion!* Obviously, there is a lot more than pork belly trading 
involved here. 
Today's futures markets encompass all of the worl d's major market groups: interest rates (e.g., T-
bonds), stock indexes (e.g., the S&P 500), currencies (e.g., Japanese yen), pr ecious metals (e.g., 
gold), energy (e.g., crude oil), and agricultural commodities (e.g., corn). Although the futures

Chunk 2628 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
markets had their origins in agri cultural commodities, this sector now acc ounts for only about one-
fifth of total futures trading. During the past decade, the introduc tion and spectacular growth of 
many new contracts has resulted in the financial-type markets (currenc ies, interest rate instruments, 
and stock indexes) accounting for approximately 60 percent 
*This is a rough but conservative estimate base d on 246 million contracts traded and assuming an

Chunk 2629 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
average contract value well over $40,000. (Excluding short-term intere st rate futures, such as 
Eurodollars, single contract values ranged from about $11,000 for sugar at Ю0ДЬ. to $150,000 for 
the S&P 500 at an index value of 300.) of all futures trading. (Energy and metal markets account 
for nearly half of the remaining 40 percent.) Th us, while the term commodities is often used to 
refer to the futures markets, it has increasing ly become a misnomer. Many of the most actively

Chunk 2630 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
traded futures markets, such as those in the fina ncial instruments, are not truly commodities, while 
many commodity markets have no corresponding futures markets. 
The essence of a futures market is in its name: Trading involves a standardized contract for a 
commodity, such as gold, or a financial instrument , such as T-bonds, for a fu ture delivery date, as 
opposed to the present time. For ex ample, if an automobile manufacturer needs copper for current

Chunk 2631 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
operations, it will buy its materials directly from  a producer. If, however, the same manufacturer 
was concerned that copper prices  would be much higher in six m onths, it could approximately lock 
in its costs at that time by buying c opper futures now. (This offset of future price risk is called a 
hedge.) If copper prices climbed during the interim, the profit on the futures hedge would

Chunk 2632 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
approximately offset the higher co st of copper at the time of actua l purchase. Of c ourse, if copper 
prices declined instead, the futu res hedge would result in a loss,  but the manufacturer would end up 
buying its copper at lower levels than it was willing to lock in. 
While hedgers, such as the above automobile manuf acturer, participate in futures markets to reduce 
the risk of an adverse price move, traders particip ate in an effort to profit from anticipated price

Chunk 2633 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
changes. In fact, many traders will prefer the futu res markets over their cash  counterparts as trading 
vehicles for a variety of reasons: 
1. Standardized contracts —Futures contracts are standardized (in terms of quantity and quality); 
thus, the trader does not have to find a specific buye r or seller in order to initiate or liquidate a 
position. 
2. Liquidity —All of the major futures markets provide excellent liquidity.

Chunk 2634 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
3. Ease of going short —The futures markets allow equal ease  of going short as well as long. For 
example, the short seller in the stock market (who is actually borrowing stock to sell) must wait for 
an uptick,  before initiating a position; no such  restriction exists in the futures markets. 
4. Leverage —The futures markets offer tremendous le verage. Roughly speaking, initial margin 
requirements are usually equal to 5 to 10 per cent of th e contract value. (T he use of the term margin

Chunk 2635 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
in the futures market is unfortuna te because it leads to tremendous  confusion with the concept of 
margins in stocks. In the futures markets, marg ins do not imply partial payments, since no actual 
physical transaction occurs until the expiration  date; rather, margins are basically good-faith 
deposits.) Although high leverage is one of the attrib utes of futures markets for traders, it should be

Chunk 2636 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
emphasized that leverage is a tw o-edged sword. The undisciplined us e of leverage is the single 
most important reason why most tr aders lose money in the futures markets. In general, futures 
prices are no more volatile than  the underlying cash prices or, for that matter, many stocks. The 
high-risk reputation of futures is largel y a consequence of th e leverage factor.

Chunk 2637 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
5. Low transaction costs —Futures markets provide very low tran saction costs. For example, it is  11far less expensive for a stock portfolio manager to  reduce market exposure by selling the equivalent 
dollar amount of stock index futures cont racts than by selling individual stocks. 
6. Ease of offset —A futures position can be offset at any time during market hours, providing 
prices are not locked at limit-up or limitdown. (S ome futures markets specify daily maximum price

Chunk 2638 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
changes. In cases in which free market forces w ould normally seek an equilibrium price outside the 
range of boundaries implied by price limits, the mark et will simply move to the limit and virtually 
cease to trade.) 
7. Guaranteed by exchange —The futures trader does not have to be concerned about the financial 
stability of the person on the other side of the tr ade. All futures transactions are guaranteed by the 
clearinghouse of the exchange.

Chunk 2639 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
clearinghouse of the exchange. 
Since by their very structure, futures are closely ti ed to their underlying ma rkets (the activity of 
arbitrageurs assures that deviati ons are relatively minor and short liv ed), price moves in futures will 
very closely parallel those in the corresponding cash markets. Keepi ng in mind that the majority of 
futures trading activity is concentrated in financia l instruments, many futures traders are, in reality,

Chunk 2640 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
traders in stocks, bonds, and cu rrencies. In this context, the comments of futures traders 
interviewed in the following chapters have dir ect relevance even to i nvestors who have never 
ventured beyond stocks and bonds. 
 
The Interbank Currency Market Defined 
The interbank currency market is a twenty-four- hour market which literally follows the sun around 
the world, moving from banking cente rs in the U.S. to Australia, to the Far East, to Europe, and

Chunk 2641 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
finally back to the U.S. The market exists to fill the need of companies to hedge exchange risk in a 
world of rapidly fluctua ting currency values. For example, if a Japanese electronics manufacturer 
negotiates an export sale of stereo equipment to the U.S. with payment in dollars to be received six 
months hence, that manufacturer is vulnerable to a depreciation of the dolla r versus the yen during

Chunk 2642 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the interim. If the manufacturer wants to assure a fixed price in the local cu rrency (yen) in order to 
lock in a profit, he can hedge himself by selling the equivalent amount of  U.S. dollars in the 
interbank market for the antici pated date of payment. The ba nks will quote the manufacturer an 
exchange rate for the precise amount re quired, for the specific future date. 
Speculators trade in the interbank currency market in  a n  e f f o r t  t o  p r o f i t  from their expectations

Chunk 2643 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
regarding shifts in exchange rates. For exampl e, a speculator who anticipated a decline in the 
British pound against the dollar would simply sell forward British pounds. (All transactions in the 
interbank market are denominated in U.S. dollars .) A speculator who exp ected the British pound to 
decline versus the Japanese yen would buy a specifi c dollar amount of Japanese yen and sell an 
equivalent dollar amount of British pounds. 
  12Michael Marcus - Blighting Never Strikes Twice

Chunk 2644 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Michael Marcus began his career as a commodity research analyst for a major brokerage house. His 
near-compulsive attraction to trading led him to abandon his salaried position to pursue full-time 
trading. After a brief, almost co mical, stint as a floor trader, he  went to work for Commodities 
Corporation, a firm that hired professional tr aders to trade the company's own funds. Marcus 
became one of their most successful traders. In a number of years, his profits exceeded the

Chunk 2645 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
combined total profit of all the other traders. Over a ten-year period, he multiplied his company 
account by an incredible 2,500-fold! 
I first met Marcus the day I join ed Reynolds Securities as a future s research analyst. Marcus had 
accepted a similar job at a competing firm, and I wa s assuming the position he had just vacated. In 
those early years in both our careers, we met regularly. Although I usually found my own analysis

Chunk 2646 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
more persuasive when we disagreed, Marcus u ltimately proved right about the direction of the 
market. Eventually, Marcus accepted a job as a tr ader, became very successful, and moved out to 
the West Coast. 
When I first conceived the idea for this book, Marc us was high on my list of interview candidates. 
Marcus' initial response to my request was agreeable,  but not firm. Several weeks later, he declined,

Chunk 2647 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
as his desire to maintain anonymity domina ted his natural inclination to participate Ь an endeavor 
he found appealing. (Marcus knew a nd respected many of the other traders I was interviewing.) I 
was very disappointed because Marcus is one of th e finest traders I have been privileged to know. 
Fortunately, some additional persuasion by a mutual friend helped change his mind. 
When I met Marcus for this interview, it had been  seven years since we had last seen each other.

Chunk 2648 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The interview was conducted in Marcus' home, a two-house complex set on a cliff overlooking a 
private beach in Southern California. You ente r the complex through a massive gate ("amazing 
gate" as described by an assistant who provided me  with driving directi ons) that would probably 
have a good chance of holding up th rough a panzer division attack. 
On first greeting, Marcus seemed aloof, almost w ithdrawn. This quiet side of Marcus' personality

Chunk 2649 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
makes his description of his short- lived attempt to be a floor trader  particularly striking. He became 
animated, however, as soon as he  began talking about his trading experience s. Our conversation 
focused on his early "roller coaster"  years, which he considered to be the most inte resting of his 
career. 
How did you first get interested in trading futures? 
I was something of a scholar. In  1969, I graduated from Johns Hopkins, Phi Beta Kappa, near the

Chunk 2650 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
top of my class. I had a Ph.D. fellowship in psyc hology at Clark University, and fully expected to 
live the life of a professor. Th rough a mutual friend, I met this fellow named John, who claimed he 
could double my money every two weeks, like clockwork. That sounded very appealing [he 
laughs]. I don't think I even asked John how he coul d do it. It was such an attractive idea that I 
didn't want to spoil things by finding out too ma ny facts. I was afraid I would get cold feet.

Chunk 2651 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Weren't you skeptical? Didn't he sound too much like a used car salesman? 
No, I had never invested in anything, and I was ve ry naive. I hired John, who was a junior at my 
school, to be my commodity trading advisor at $30 a week. Occasionally, I threw in free potato 
chips and soda. He had a theory th at you could subsist on that diet. 
That's all you paid him? Weren't there any prof it incentives—extra potato chips if he did 
well? 
No. 
How much money did you  allot for trading?

Chunk 2652 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
No. 
How much money did you  allot for trading? 
About $1,000 that I had saved up.  
Then what happened? 
My first trip to a brokerage house was very, very exciting. I got dressed up, putting on my only suit, 
and we went to the Reynolds Securities office in Baltimore. It was a big, posh office, suggesting a 
lot of old money. There was mahogany all over the place and a hushed, reverential tone permeated

Chunk 2653 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the office. It was all very impressive.  13The focal point was a big commodity board at the fr ont of the office, the ki nd that clicked the old-
fashioned way. It was really exciting to hear th e click, click, click. They had a gallery from which 
the traders could watch the board, but it was so far away that we had to use binoculars to see the 
prices. That was also very exciting, becau se it was just like wa tching a horse race.

Chunk 2654 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
My first realization that things might become  a little scary was when a voice came over the 
loudspeaker recommending the purchase of soybean meal. I looked at John, expecting to see an 
expression of confidence and assurance on his fa ce. Instead, he looked at me and asked, "Do you 
think we should do it?" [he laughs]. It quickly da wned on me that John didn't know anything at all. 
I remember soybean meal was trading quietly: 78.30,78.40,78.30, 78.40. We put the order in, and

Chunk 2655 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
as soon as we got the confirmation back, almost mystically, the prices started clicking down. As 
soon as it knew that I was in, th e market took that as a signal to  start descending. I guess I had good 
instincts even then, because I im mediately said to John, "We're not  doing too well, let's get out!" 
We lost about $100 on that trade. 
The next trade was in corn, and the same thi ng happened. John asked me whether we should do the

Chunk 2656 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trade. I said, "Well all right, let's try com." The outcome was the same. 
Did you know anything at all about what you were doing? Had you read anything about 
commodities or trading? 
No, nothing. 
Did you even know the contract sizes? 
No, we didn't. 
Did you know how much it was costing you per tick? 
Yes. 
Apparently, that was about the only thing you knew. 
Right. Our next trade, in wheat, didn't work either. After that, we went back to corn and that trade

Chunk 2657 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
worked out better, it took us th ree days to lose our money. We  were measuring success by the 
number of days it took us to lose. 
Were you always getting out after about a $100 loss? 
Yes, although one trade lost almost $200.1 was down to about $500 when John came up with an 
idea that was "going to save the day." We woul d buy August pork bellies and sell February pork 
bellies because the spread was wider than the carrying charges [the total cost of taking delivery in

Chunk 2658 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
August, storing, and redelivering in February]. He said we couldn't lose on that trade. 
I vaguely understood the idea and ag reed to the trade. That was the first time we decided to go out 
to lunch. All the other times we had been too busy scrutinizing the board, but  we thought this was a 
"can't lose" trade, so it was sa fe to leave. By the time we came back, I was just about wiped out. I 
remember this feeling of s hock, dismay, and incredulity.

Chunk 2659 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I will never forget the image of John—he was a very portly guy with thick, opaque glasses—going 
up to the quote board, pounding and shaking his fist  at it, and shouting, "Doesn't anyone want to 
make a guaranteed profit!" Later on, I learned that  August pork bellies were not deliverable against 
the February contract. The logic of th e trade was flawed in the first place. 
Had John ever traded before? 
No. 
So where did he come up with this story about doubling your money every two weeks?

Chunk 2660 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I don't know, but after that trade, I was wiped out. So I told John that, in light of what happened, I 
thought I knew as much as he did—which was nothi ng—and that I was going to  fire him. No more 
potato chips; no more diet soda. I'll never forg et his response. He told me, "You are making the 
greatest mistake of your life!" I asked him what he was going to  do. He said, "I am going to 
Bermuda to wash dishes to make a trading stak e. Then I am going to become a millionaire and

Chunk 2661 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
retire." The thing that amused me was that he didn't say, "I'm going to Bermuda and take a job to 
make a trading stake." He was very specific; he was going to wash dishes to get his trading stake. 
What eventually happened to John?  14To this day, I have no idea. For all I know, he might oe living in  Bermuda as a millionaire because 
he washed dishes. 
After that, I managed to rustle up another $500 a nd placed a few silver trades. I wiped out that

Chunk 2662 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
stake as well. My first eight trades, five with  John and three on my  own, were all losers. 
Did the thought ever enter your mind that maybe trading was not for you? 
No. I had always done well at school , so I figured it was just a quest ion of getting the knack of it. 
My father, who died when I was fifteen, had left $3,000 in life insurance, which I decided to cash 
in, despite my mother's objections.

Chunk 2663 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
in, despite my mother's objections. 
But I knew I really needed to learn something be fore trading again. I read Chester Keltner's books 
on wheat and soybeans, and I also subscribed to his market letter, which made trading 
recommendations. I followed the first recommenda tion, which was to buy wheat, and it worked. I 
think I made 4 cents per bushel [$200] on that tr ade. It was my first win and very exciting.

Chunk 2664 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Then between letters, the market fell back to my original buying pr ice, so I bought  it again and 
made another profit on my own. I felt I was beginning to develop a sense for trading. Even in the 
beginning, I liked the feeli ng of doing things on my  own. What happened next was just sheer luck. 
I bought three contracts of December corn in  the summer of 1970, based on a Keltner 
recommendation. That was the summer th at blight devastated the corn crop. 
Was that your first big win?

Chunk 2665 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Was that your first big win? 
Yes, that trade combined with buying some mo re com, wheat, and soybeans, partly on 
recommendations in the letter, and partly on my own intuition. When that glorious summer was 
over, I had accumulated $30,000, a princely sum to me, having come from a middle class family. I 
thought it was the best thing in the world. 
How did you decide when to take profits? 
I took some on the way up and some when the ma rkets started coming down. Overall, I cashed in

Chunk 2666 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
very well. 
So instinctively, you were doin g the right thing even then? 
Yes. Then that fall I attended graduate school in Worcester, Massachusetts, but I found that I didn't 
want to think about my thesis. Instead of going to cl ass, I would often sn eak down to the Paine 
Webber office in Worcester to trade. 
I was having a great time. I made a little money, not a lot. I was shocked to find myself cutting

Chunk 2667 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
classes frequently, since I had been a dedicated scholar at Johns Hopkins. I realized that the 
handwriting was on the wall, and in Decembe r 19701 dropped out of school and moved to New 
York. I stayed at the Y for a while. When people as ked me what I did, I rather pompously told them 
that I was a speculator. It had a nice ring to it. 
In the spring of 1971, the grains started getting interesting again. There was a theory around that

Chunk 2668 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the blight had wintered over—that is, it had surviv ed the winter and was going to attack the corn 
crop again. I decided I would be really positioned for the blight this time. 
Was this Keltner's theory, or just a market rumor? 
I think Keltner believed it too. I borrowed $20,000 from my mother, added it to my $30,000, and 
bet everything on the blight. I boug ht the maximum number of corn  and wheat contracts possible

Chunk 2669 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
for $50,000 in margin. Initially, the markets held steady because there was enough fear of the blight 
to keep prices up. I wasn't maki ng money, but I wasn't losing it e ither. Then one day—I will never 
forget this—there was an article in the Wall Street Journal with the headline: "More Blight on the 
Floor of the Chicago Board of Trade Than in Mi dwest Cornfields" [he laughs]. The corn market 
opened sharply lower and fairly quickly went limit-down.

Chunk 2670 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
[hi many futures markets, the maximum daily price change is restricted by a specified limit. Limit-
down refers to a decline of this ma gnitude, while limit-up refers to an equivalent gain. If, as in this 
case, the equilibrium price that would result from the interaction of free market forces lies below 
the limit-down price, then the market will lock limit-down [i.e., trading will virtually cease.

Chunk 2671 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Reason: there will be an  abundance of sellers, but virtually no willing buyers at th e restricted limit-
down price.]  15Were you watching the market collapse? 
Yes, I was in the brokerage office, watching the board as prices fell. 
Did you think of getting out on the way down  before the market wa s locked limit-down? 
I felt that I should get out, but I just watched. I was totally paralyzed. I was hoping the market

Chunk 2672 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
would turn around. I watched and watched and then after it locked limit-dow n, I couldn't get out. I 
had all night to think about it, but  I really had no choice. I didn't have any more money and had to 
get out. The next morning, I liquidate d my entire position on the opening. 
Was the market sharply lo wer again on the opening? 
No, not sharply, just about 2 cents. 
How much did you lose on the tr ade by the time you liquidated?

Chunk 2673 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I lost my own $30,000, plus $ 12,000 of the $20,000 my mo ther had lent me. That was my lesson in 
betting my whole wad. 
What did you do then? 
I was really upset. I decided I had to go to work. Since there was a recession at the time, I thought I 
probably couldn't get a really good job and should tr y to settle for a lesser  position. I found that 
even though I interviewed for positions for which I was unusually well qualified, I couldn't seem to

Chunk 2674 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
get any job. I finally realized th at I couldn't get these jobs becau se I didn't really want them. 
One of the best job openings I found was a commodity research analyst slot at  Reynolds Securities. 
I discovered that it was easier to get this better po sition because they could tell I really wanted it. I 
learned that if you shoot for what you want, you stand a much better chan ce of getting it because 
you care much more.

Chunk 2675 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
you care much more. 
Anyway, there was a glass partition betweenmy offi ce and the main office where the brokers sat. I 
still had the trading bug and it was very painful to watch them trading and whooping it up. 
While you were just doing the research? 
Right, because the analysts were st rictly forbidden to trade. But I decided I wouldn't let that stop 
me. I borrowed from my mother again, my brothe r, and my girlfriend and opened an account at

Chunk 2676 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
another firm. I worked out an intricate code syst em with my broker to k eep people in my office 
from knowing that I was violating the rules. For ex ample, if I said, "the sun was out," that meant 
one thing, while if I said, "the weat her is cloudy," it meant something else. 
While I was trying to write my market reports, I ke pt peering out through the glass partition to see 
the prices on the big trading board  in the main office. When I was winning, I tried to hide my

Chunk 2677 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
elation, and when I was losing, I had to make su re not to let it show on my face. I don't think 
anyone ever caught on, but I was in a manic-depre ssive state throughout that  time. I felt tortured 
because I wanted to be free to trade wit hout going through this elaborate charade. 
Were you making or losing money during this time? 
I lost. It was the same old cycle of bo rrowing money and cons istently losing it. 
Did you know what you were doing wrong then?

Chunk 2678 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Did you know what you were doing wrong then? 
Good question. Basically, I had no real grasp of trading principles; I was doing everything wrong. 
Then in October 1971, while at my broker's office, I met one of the people to  whom I attribute my 
success. 
Who was that? 
Ed Seykota. He is a genius and a great trader w ho has been phenomenally successful. When I first 
met Ed he had recently graduated from MIT and ha d developed one of the first computer programs

Chunk 2679 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
for testing and trading technical systems. I still don't know how Ed amassed so much knowledge 
about trading at such an early age. 
Ed told me, "I think you ought to work here. We are starting a resear ch group and you can trade 
your own account." It sounde d great; the only problem was that th e firm's research director refused 
to hire me. 
Why?

Chunk 2680 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to hire me. 
Why? 
I couldn't imagine why since I wrote well and had experience. When I pressed him for a reason, he  16told me, "I can't hire you because you already know too much and I want to train somebody." I 
said, "Look, I will do anything you want." Ev entually, I convinced him to hire me. 
It was really great, because I had Ed to learn from, and he was alr eady a very successful trader. He

Chunk 2681 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
was basically a trend follower, who utilized classic trading principl es. He taught me how to cut my 
losses, as well as the importance of riding winners. 
Ed provided an excellent role model. For example, one time, he was short silver and the market just 
kept eking down, a half penny a day, a penny a day. Everyone else seemed to be bullish, talking 
about why silver had to go up because it was so cheap, but Ed just stayed short. Ed said, "The trend

Chunk 2682 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
is down, and I'm going to stay short until the tre nd changes." I learned patience from him in the 
way he followed the trend. 
Did Ed's example turn you around as a trader? 
Not initially. I continued to lose, even with Ed there. 
Do you remember what you were still doing wrong at that time? 
I think I wasn't patient enough to wa it for a clearly defined situation. 
Did you think of just tailcoating Ed, because he was so successful? 
No, I couldn't bring myself to do that.

Chunk 2683 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
No, I couldn't bring myself to do that. 
Did you ever think of just giving up on trading? 
I would sometimes think that maybe I ought to st op trading because it was very painful to keep 
losing. In "Fiddler on the Roof," there is a scene where the lead looks up and talks to God. I would 
look up and say, "Am I really that stupid?" And I seemed to hear a clear answer saying, "No, you 
are not stupid. You just have to keep at it." So I did.

Chunk 2684 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
At the time, I was befriended by a very kind, know ledgeable, and successful  semiretired broker at 
Shearson named Amos Hostetter. He liked my writi ng, and we used to talk. Amos reinforced a lot 
of the things Ed taught me. I was getting the same principles from two people. 
Were you making recommendations for the firm at the time? 
Yes. 
And how did the recommendations work out? 
They were better because I was more patient. Anyway, I was tota lly out of money, and out of

Chunk 2685 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
people who would lend me money.  But I still had a kind of st ubborn confidence that I could 
somehow get back on the right track again. I was only making $12,500  a year, but I managed to 
save $700. Since that wasn't even enough to open an account, I opened a joint account with a friend 
who also put up $700. 
Were you totally directing the tr ading in this joint account? 
Yes, my friend didn't know anything about the mark ets. This was in July 1972 and, at the time, we

Chunk 2686 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
were under price controls. The futures market  was supposedly also under price controls. 
This was Nixon's price freeze? 
Yes. As I recall, the plywood pr ice was theoretically frozen at  $110 per 1,000 square feet. Plywood 
was one of the markets I analyzed for the firm. Th e price had edged up close to $110, and I put out 
a bearish newsletter saying even though supplie s were tight, since prices couldn't go beyond $110, 
there was nothing to lose by going short at $110.

Chunk 2687 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How did the government keep prices at the se t limits? What prevented supply and demand 
from dictating a higher price? 
It was against the law for prices to go higher. 
You mean producers couldn't charge more for it? 
Right. What was happening though was that the price was being kept artificially low,  and there is 
an economic principle that an artificially low pric e will create a shortage. So shortages developed in

Chunk 2688 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
plywood, but supposedly  the futures market was al so under this gu ideline. However, no one was 
sure; it was sort of a gray area. One day, while I was looking at the quote board, the price hit $110. 
Then it hit $110.10; then $110.20. In other words, the futures price was trading 20 cents over the 
legal ceiling. So I started calling around to see what was going to happen, but nobody seemed to  17know. 
Was plywood the only market ex ceeding its price freeze level?

Chunk 2689 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yes. Anyway, nothing happened. I think the mark et closed somewhere over $110 that day. The 
next day it opened at about $110.80.1 used the follo wing reasoning: If they let it trade over $110 
today, they might let it trade anywhere. So I bought one contract. Well, ultimately, plywood went 
to $200. After I bought that first contract, and pri ces rose, it was just a matter of pyramiding and 
riding the position.

Chunk 2690 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
riding the position. 
Was that your first really big trade after you  had been wiped out in the corn market? 
Yes. 
Did the cash plywood market stay at $110? 
The futures market functioned as  a supply of last resort to users who couldn't get supplies 
elsewhere. 
Basically, it created a two-tiered mark et, a sort of legal black market? 
Yes. Those who were frozen out because they didn't have any longstanding relationships with

Chunk 2691 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
producers could get their plywood at a higher pri ce in the futures market. The producers were 
fuming at the thought that they had to sell at the legal price ceiling. 
Why didn't producers just sell futures and deliver against the contract as opposed to selling 
in the cash market at the price control level? 
The smarter ones were learning that, but it was the infancy of futures trading in plywood and most

Chunk 2692 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
producers weren't that sophisticated. Some producers probably weren't sure that it was legal to do 
that. Even if they thought it was, their lawyer s might have told them, "Maybe people can buy 
plywood at any price in the futures market, but we better not sell and deliver above the legal 
ceiling." There were a lot of questions. 
Did the government ever try to int erfere with the futures markets?

Chunk 2693 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Well not exactly, but I will get b ack to that. In just a few m onths, $700 had grown into $12,000 
trading plywood. 
Was this the only trade you had on? 
Yes. Then I got the bright idea that the same shor tage situation was going to occur in lumber. I bet 
everything on one trade just as I had on the corn/wheat trade, expe cting that lumber would also go 
through the ceiling price. 
What was lumber doing at this time?

Chunk 2694 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
What was lumber doing at this time? 
It did nothing. It just watched plywood go from  $110 to $200. Since they were both wood products, 
and lumber was also in short supply, I reasone d that lumber could go way up—and it should have. 
However, after I bought lumber at around $130, the government finally woke up to what had 
happened in plywood, and they were determined not to let the same thing happen in lumber.

Chunk 2695 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The day after I went long, some government offi cial came out with an announcement that they 
were going to crack down on specul ators in lumber who were trying to ran up the market like they 
had ply wood. The lumber market crashed just on that statement. I was down to the point where I 
was close to being wiped out agai n. There was a two-week period du ring which they kept issuing 
these statements. The market stab ilized at a level just above wher e I would have been wiped out. I

Chunk 2696 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
had just enough money left to hang on to my position. 
The market was at $130 when you boug ht it. Where was it at this time? 
About$117. 
So even though the magnitude of this declin e was much smaller than the price rise in 
plywood, you lost almost as much money because you had a much larger position in lumber 
than you had in plywood. 
Right. During those two weeks, I was constantly on the verge of being wiped out. It was the worst

Chunk 2697 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
two weeks in my whole life. I went to the office each day just about ready to give up. 
Giving up just to stop the pain, or so that  you would at least have something left?  18Both. I was so upset that I couldn't stop my hands from shaking. 
How close did you come to being wiped out again? 
Well, my $12,000 had shrunk to under $4,000. 
Did you say to yourself, "I can't believe I have done this again"? 
Yes, and I never did it again. That was the last time I bet everything on one trade.

Chunk 2698 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
What eventually happened? 
I managed to hold on, and the market finally turned around. There wa s a shortage, and the 
government didn't seem to have the will to stop the futures market. 
Was it insight or courage that gave you the willpower to hold on? 
Desperation, mainly, although there was a support point on the charts that the market couldn't seem 
to take out. So, I held on. At  the end of that year, the $700, wh ich I had ran up to over $ 12,000 and

Chunk 2699 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
back to under $4,000, was now worth $24,000. After that scary experience, I never really 
overtraded again. 
The next year, 1973, the government began lifting the price controls. Because the price controls had 
created numerous artificial shortages, when they were lifted, there was a tremendous run-up in 
many commodities. Just about everyt hing went up. Prices doubled in  many markets, and I was able

Chunk 2700 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to take advantage of the tremendous leverage o ffered by low futures margins. The lessons I had 
learned from Seykota about staying in markets w ith major trends really paid off. In 1973, my 
account grew from $24,000 to $64,000. 
At that time, we were seeing something comp letely new. I remember those markets. Even 
after prices had gone up only 10 percent of their eventual advance, historically, it seemed like

Chunk 2701 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
a very large price move. What made you realize that prices could go so much further? 
At the time, I was politically right wing and that fit with being an inflation-alarmist. The theory that 
the evil government was constantly debasing th e currency provided the perfect perspective for 
trading the inflationary markets of the mid-1970s. 
It was the right theory  for the right time. 
Right. The markets were so fertile for trading then that I could make plenty of mistakes and still do 
well.

Chunk 2702 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
well. 
Trading strictly on the long side? 
Yes. Everything was going up. Although I was doing ve ry well, I did make one terrible mistake. 
During the great soybean bull mark et, the one that went from $3.25 to nearly $12,1 impulsively 
took my profits and got out of ever ything. I was trying to be fancy instead of st aying with the trend. 
Ed Seykota never would get out of  anything unless the trend change d. So Ed was in, while I was

Chunk 2703 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
out, and I watched in agony as so ybeans went limit-up for twelve consecutive days. I was real 
competitive, and every day I would come into the office knowing he was in and I was out. I 
dreaded going to work, because I knew soybeans would be bid limit again and I couldn't get in. 
Was this experience of not being in a runaw ay market as aggravating as actually losing 
money? 
Yes, more so. It was so aggravating that one day I felt I couldn't take it anymore and I tried

Chunk 2704 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
tranquilizers to dull the mental  anguish. When that didn't work, somebody said, "Why don't you 
take something stronger, called thorazine?" 
I remember taking this thorazine at home and th en getting on the subway  to go to work. The 
subway doors started to close as I was getting on and I started to fa ll down. At first,  I didn't connect 
it with the thorazine. Anyway, I wandered back  home and just fell through the doorway—it was

Chunk 2705 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that strong. It knocked me out and I missed work th at day. That was the low point in my trading 
career. 
You never threw in the towel and just went back into soybeans at some point? 
No, I was afraid of losing. 
Despite that mistake, you mentioned before  that you built your account up to $64,000 by 
year-end. What happened next?  19Around that time, I would occasionally have to go over to the Cotton Exchange. I would have an

Chunk 2706 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
adrenalin rush when I heard the traders yelling and screaming. It seemed like the most exciting 
place in the world. But I learned that I needed to show $100,000 net worth to get in. Since I had 
virtually no assets outside of my commodity account , I couldn't qualify. I continued to make money 
in the markets, and after several months, I had surpassed the $100,000 mark. Around that same 
time, Ed Seykota recommended that I go long coffee.  So I did, but I put a close stop in under the

Chunk 2707 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
market just in case it went down. The market  turned down and I was stopped out quickly. Ed, 
however, because he was a major trend follower, had no stop in a nd ended up being locked in a 
limit-down market for several days in succession. 
Each day, Seykota was locked in a losing position wh ile I was out of the market. That was the exact 
opposite situation of the soybean trade, when he was in a winning trade and I was out. I couldn't

Chunk 2708 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
help it, but I felt a sense of joy. I asked myself, "What kind of a pl ace is this that one's greatest joy 
is to be found when somebody else is getting scre wed?" That was the point I realized that what I 
was doing was too competitive, and I decided to become a floor trader at the New York Cotton 
Exchange 
It sounds like the floor would h ave been even more competitive. 
Well, maybe, but it wasn't. 
Did you have any concern about being a floor  trader—the fact that you were now reducing

Chunk 2709 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
your field of opportunity down to one market? 
I was a little concerned about it. As it turned out, I should have been very worried. However, the 
thought of trading in the ring was very exciting to me. The truth of the matter was that while I was 
very good at picking trades, I was a total bust at the execution part. I was very shy, and I was too 
timid to yell loud enough to make  myself heard on the floor. I e nded up slipping my orders to a

realized what I was doing. 
Were you still approaching the markets as a po sition trader even thou gh you were on the

Yes, but it was just out of timidity. 
So, I assume that many days  you weren't even trading. 
Right. 
Was there any advantage to being on the floor? 
No, not for me. But I did learn a lot from the experience, and I would recommend it to anybody

Chunk 2711 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
who wants to become a better trader. I used what I learned there for years. 
What type of things did you learn? 
You develop an almost subconscious sense of th e market on the floor. You learn to gauge price 
movement by the intensity of the voices in the ri ng. For example, when the market is active and 
moving, and then gets quiet, that is often a sign that it is not going to go much further. Also,

Chunk 2712 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
sometimes when the ring is moderately loud and suddenly gets very loud, instead of being a sign 
that the market is ready to blast off, as you might  think, it actually indica tes that the market is 
running into a greater am ount of opposing orders. 
But how do you use that type of information once you are off the floor? You said that the 
things you learned on the floor helped you later on.

Chunk 2713 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I learned the importance of intraday chart points, such as  earlier daily highs. At  key intraday chart 
points, I could take much larger positions than  I could afford to hold, and if it didn't work 
immediately, I would get out quickly. For example, at a critical intraday point, I would take a 
twenty-contract position, instead of the three to five contracts I could a fford to hold, using an 
extremely close stop. The market either took off and ran, or I was out. Sometimes I would make

Chunk 2714 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
300,400 points or more, with only a 10-point risk. That was because, by bei ng on the floor, I had 
become familiar with how the market responded to those intraday points. My  trading in those days 
was a little bit like being a surfer. I was trying to hit the crest of the wave just at the right moment.

Chunk 2715 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
But if it didn't work, I just got out. I was getting a shot at making several hundred points and hardly  20risking anything. I later used that surfing tech nique as a desk trader. Although that approach 
worked real well then, I don't think it w ould work as well in today's markets. 
Is that because the markets have become choppier? 
Right. In those days, if the market reached an intr aday chart point, it might penetrate that point, 
take off, and never look back. Now it often comes back.

Chunk 2716 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
So what is the answer? 
I think the secret is cutting dow n the number of trades you make. The best trades are the ones in 
which you have all three things go ing for you: fundamentals, technical s, and market tone. First, the 
fundamentals should suggest that there is an im balance of supply and de mand, which could result 
in a major move. Second, the chart must show that the market is moving in the direction that the

Chunk 2717 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
fundamentals suggest. Third, when news comes out, th e market should act in a way that reflects the 
right psychological tone. For example, a bull ma rket should shrug off bearish news and respond 
vigorously to bullish news. If you can restrict your  activity to only those types of trades, you have 
to make money, in any market, under any circumstances. 
Is that more restrictive trading style the approach you eventually adopted?

Chunk 2718 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
No, because basically I enjoyed th e game too much. I knew that I should only be in those optimum 
trades, but trading was a release and hobby for me. It replaced a lot of other things in my life. I 
placed the fun of the action ahead of my own criteria. However, th e thing that saved me was that 
when a trade met all my criteria, I would enter fi ve to six times the posi tion size I was doing on the 
other trades. 
Were all your profits coming from the trades that met the criteria? 
Yes.

Chunk 2719 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yes. 
Were the other trades breaking even? 
The other trades broke even and kept me amused. 
Did you keep track of which were whic h so you knew what was going on? 
Just mentally. My goal on the other trades was ju st to break even. I knew that the big money was 
going to be made on the trades that  met my criteria. There will alwa ys be trades that meet those 
requirements, but there may be fewer of them , so you have to be much more patient.

Chunk 2720 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Why are there fewer such trades? Has the marketplace gotten more sophisticated? 
Yes. There are many more professional traders than in  my early days. In those years, I had an edge 
just by knowing the angles that  Ed Seykota and Amos Hostelle r laught me. Now everybody knows 
those principles. You have trading rooms filled with bright people and computers. 
In those days, you watched the board, and you would buy corn when it moved above a key chart

Chunk 2721 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
point An hour later the grain el evator operator would gel a call fr om his broker and he mighl buy. 
The nexl day, Ihe brokerage house would recommend the trade, pushing the market up some more. 
On the third day, we would get short covering from the people that were wrong, and then some 
fresh buying from the dentists of the world, who fina lly got the word that il was the right time lo 
buy. Al that lime, I was one of the first ones lo  buy because I was one of the few professional

Chunk 2722 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
traders playing the game. I would wind up sellin g out lo the dentists several days later. 
You're talking about short-term trades. Weren't you trading for the major moves? 
I traded some major moves, but ma ny times I would make my profits in two or three days in jusl 
that kind of trade. 
When did you get back in the market? 
Well, the dentisls weren'l going to keep their po sitions, since they were buying at the wrong time.

Chunk 2723 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
So when the market would fall back, I would go b ack in. Nowadays, the mome nt the market breaks 
a key chart point, it is perceive d by a whole univers e of traders. 
So the lagged follow-up trades are no longer there? 
Right, the grain elevator operator has already bet.  The dentists don't count because their level of 
trading participation is infinitesimal.  21Is that because they now have their money invest ed with fund managers instead of trading by 
themselves?

Chunk 2724 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
themselves? 
Right, and even if the dentists are still there, they are trading one-lots, which is a meaningless 
position when the fund managers are trading a t housand at a clip. Now you almost have to be 
contrary. You have to ask, "Isn't it true that all my fellow professi onal traders are already in, so who 
is left to buy?" You didn't have to worry about that be fore, because there was always somebody left

Chunk 2725 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to buy—the people who were getting the informati on or reacting slower. No w, everybody is just as 
decisive, just as fast. 
Are the markets more prone to false breakouts now? 
Yes, much more. 
Are trend-following systems th en doomed to mediocrity? 
I believe so. I believe that the era of trend follow ing is over until and unle ss there is a particular 
imbalance in a market that overrides everything  else. [The 1988 drought in the grain belt, which

Chunk 2726 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
developed shortly after this interview, provides aper fect example of the type of exception Marcus is 
describing.] Another exception would be if we were  to enter a major infla tionary or deflationary 
environment. 
In other words, unless there is some very powerful force that can overwhelm everything else. 
Yes. 
 
Have the markets changed during the past five  to ten years because professional money 
managers now account for a much greater prop ortion of speculative trading activity, as

Chunk 2727 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
opposed to the small speculators who tend to make all the mistakes? 
The markets have changed. The proof is that Ri chard Dennis, who has done well for many years, 
lost over 50 percent on the funds  he was managing in 1988. The tr end-following systems approach 
doesn't work anymore. The problem is that on ce you have defined a trend and taken a position, 
everyone else has taken a position as well. Since there is no one left to buy, the market swings

Chunk 2728 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
around in the other dir ection and gets you out. 
One reason we don't have many good trends anym ore is that the centra l banks are preventing 
currency moves from getting out of hand by taking the other side of the trend. 
Haven't they always done that? 
I don't think so. If you look at a chart of treasur y debt held by foreign central banks, you will see 
that it has risen astrono mically during the last few years. The foreign banks seem to be taking over

Chunk 2729 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
from private foreign investors in financing our trade debts. 
What do you think that means in terms of trading, and has your own trading style changed 
because of it? 
At one time, I traded heavily in currencies. For ex ample, in the years after Reagan was first elected 
and the dollar was very strong, I would take positions as large as 600 million Deutsche marks 
between my own account and the company acc ount. At the time, that was about $300 million

Chunk 2730 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
worth. That was a pretty good line. I was probably one  of the bigger currency traders in the world, 
including the banks. 
It was very exhausting because it was a twenty-f our-hour market. When I went to sleep, I would 
have to wake up almost every two hours to check the markets. I w ould tune in every major center 
as it opened: Australia, Hong Kong,  Zurich, and London. It killed my  marriage. Nowadays, I try to

Chunk 2731 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
avoid the currencies, because I feel it is a totally politic al situation; you have to determine what the 
central banks are going to do. 
When you were trading the currencies active ly, were you getting up through the night 
because you were worried about getting caught on  the wrong side of a major move before the 
markets opened in the U.S.? 
Yes. 
Did you always trade that way, or did you ge t caught enough times so that you started  22trading around the clock?

Chunk 2732 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
It happened enough times to make me leery. 
There would be a big gap move that you could have avoided by trading overseas? 
That is right. For example, I remember one tim e, during late 1978, the do llar was getting battered, 
falling to new lows every day. This was during a period when I was cooperating and trading as a 
colleague with Brace Kovner. We used to talk hours every day. On e day, we noticed that the dollar

Chunk 2733 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
got mysteriously strong. There was an intense pr ice movement that couldn't be explained by any 
known information. We just bailed out of our l ong currency positions lik e crazy. That weekend, 
President Carter announced a dollar support program. If we had waited until the next U.S. trading 
session, we would have been annihilated. 
That situation illustrates one of the principles we believed in— namely, that the big players,

Chunk 2734 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
including the governments, would al ways tip their hand. If we saw a surprise price m ove against us 
that we didn't understand, we often got  out and looked for the reason later. 
I remember that market well. The currency futures markets were lo cked limit-down for 
several days in a row after that announcement.  You must have gotten out right near the top 
of that market. 
We made a great exit on that trad e. Anyway, my point is  that I believe, as a courtesy, the European

Chunk 2735 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
central banks are no tified about major changes we are going to make, and they often act ahead of 
U.S. policy announcements. Consequently, the price m ove shows up in Europe first, even if it is 
because of something we initiate . If it's an action initiated by th e Europeans, the price move is 
certainly going to occur there first. I think the be st hours to trade are ofte n in Europe. If I had a 
period in which I was going to devote my life to trading, I would want to live in Europe.

Chunk 2736 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Let's go back and fill in some of your tradin g history. Where did you go after you decided to 
give up on being a floor trader? 
I got a call from Amos Hostetter, who had befrie nded me at Shearson. At the time, he was also 
trading some money for Commodities Corporation. Am os told me that I would be well advised to 
consider joining Commodities  Corporation as a trader. 
At the time, their theory was that they were go ing to hire all these gr eat econometricians to be

Chunk 2737 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
traders. They had people like Paul Samuel-son on the board. They brought up the idea of hiring me 
at a meeting. The first question was, "What articles  has he written; in what  journals has he been 
published?" I had a B. A. in liberal arts and that  was it. The punch line was, "He just trades." 
Everybody thought that was very funny. 
But weren't they in busine ss to make money trading? 
They didn't think it was possible to really make money unless you had a Ph.D. But Amos

Chunk 2738 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
convinced them to give me a chance. I believe I wa s the first non-Ph.D. trader  they had ever hired. 
They started me out with $30,000 in August 1974. Afte r about ten years, I had turned that account 
into $80 million. Those were some very good years. 
Did you multiply the original $30,000 into $80 million, or did they add money along the way?  
After the first few years, they gave me another $100,000 to trade. After that time, they were always

Chunk 2739 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
taking money out. In those years, they were in an expansionary phase, and th ey taxed the traders 30 
percent a year to pay for their expenses. 
So you had to make 30 percent a year to keep  your account level. You must have had some 
incredible return years, given the growth of your account—particularly under that handicap. 
I was making at least 100 percen t a year for years and years.  
What was your best year?

Chunk 2740 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
What was your best year? 
My best year must have been 1979. It was an incr edible year. I caught gold when it went up to over 
$800. 
You caught the whole move? 
I was in and out, but I remember catching big chunks  of it—$100 per ounce at a time. It was a wild 
time. In those days, I would buy gold in Aust ralia, Hong Kong would pus h it up $10 higher, it  23would go up another $10 in London, a nd by the time New York opened, I was able to sell out at a 
$30 profit.

Chunk 2741 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
$30 profit. 
It sounds like there was an enormous advant age to buying gold in the overseas markets 
rather than in the United States. 
In those days, I had an advantage by being in California, because I was up trading in Hong Kong 
when my New York colleagues were asleep. I remember when I heard about the invasion of 
Afghanistan on the television news. I called H ong Kong to see if anybody knew about it, and

Chunk 2742 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
nobody seemed to; the price wasn't changing. I was able to buy 200,000 ounces of gold before 
anybody knew what was happening. 
That's 2,000 contracts! Did you have any liquidity  problems with their taking on that size 
position in Hong Kong? 
No, they gave me the stuff, but of course, they got fried by doing it. I was told on my last visit to 
Hong Kong that I shouldn't visit the gold floor. Some of the peopl e still remember that episode. 
They knew who was on the other side of the trade?

Chunk 2743 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yes, they knew. 
Did they think that you knew something? 
No, they probably thought I was just crazy, co ming in and buying all that gold. Then, when the 
news broke about five to ten minutes later, everybody started scrambling. I had an immediate $10 
per ounce profit on 200,000 ounces. 
It's hard to believe you could trade off the television news. 
I know. I had never done it before. That was the first, last, and only time, but I did do it.

Chunk 2744 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
That particular gold market ende d in a near-vertical rise and fall. Did you get out in time? 
Yes, I got out around $750 on the way up. I felt sick, when I saw gold go up to nearly $900. But 
later when it was back down to  $400,1 felt much better about it. 
All in all, you got out very well. What tipped you off that we were near a top? 
At that time, we had many wild markets. One of my  rales was to get out when the volatility and the

Chunk 2745 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
momentum became absolutely insane. One way I ha d of measuring that was with limit days. In 
those days, we used to have a lot of situations  when a market would go limit-up for a number of 
consecutive days. On the third straight limit-up day, I would begin to be very, very cautious. I 
would almost always get out on the fourth limit-up day. And, if I had somehow survived with any 
part of my position that long, I had a mandatory ra le to get out on the fifth limit-up day. I just

Chunk 2746 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
forced myself out of the mark et on that kind of volatility. 
Your transition from being a losing trader to be ing very successful coincided with the big bull 
phase in the commodity markets during the early to mid-1970s. How much of your early 
success was due to your skills as a trader and how much was just the markets? 
Honestly, I think the markets were so good, that by buying and holding you just couldn't lose. 
There were a lot of other success st ories. Fortunes were being made.

Chunk 2747 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
But a lot of those people didn't keep their fortunes. 
That's true. But, I was very fortunate. By the time the markets got difficult again, I was a good 
trader. By then, I had really learned my craft. Also, by that time, I had the advantage of having 
become very knowledgeable in one market: cocoa. For almost two years, I traded almost nothing 
but cocoa, because of the info rmation and help I got from He lmut Weymar [the founder of

Chunk 2748 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Commodities Corporation]. Helmut was an incredible  expert on cocoa. He wrote a book that was so 
deep I couldn't understand the cover. Also, he had all kinds of friends in the business. With the 
knowledge and information I got from Helmut and his friends, I felt that I knew the universe of 
cocoa in a way that I had never known any market before. 
That phase of almost exclusive cocoa trading obviously came to an end. What happened? 
Helmut retired from cocoa trading.

Chunk 2749 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Helmut retired from cocoa trading. 
I assume Helmut was not nearly as successful a trader as you were.  24Let's just say that I traded much bett er on Helmut's information than he did. 
Excluding the early losing years, were there any trades that stand out as being particularly 
traumatic? 
Well, I would never let myself get caught up in  potentially intimidating disasters. The worst 
situation occurred during my hea vy currency trading period. I was doing well and could afford to

Chunk 2750 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
hold large positions. One time, I had a really large position in Deutsche marks when the Bun-
desbank came in and decided to punish the speculat ors. I called in just around the time that all this 
was happening and found out that I was out $2k milli on in about five minutes . So I got out, rather 
than see the $2k million loss go to $10 million. Then  I had to endure the di sturbing experience of 
watching the market recover its entire fall. 
How long after you got out? 
About half an hour.

Chunk 2751 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
About half an hour.  
Did you go back in? 
No, they had taken the starch out of me by that point. 
In retrospect, do you feel you did the ri ght thing by getting out of that trade? 
Yes, but it still hurt to realize that if I had sat it out and done nothing, I would have been OK 
instead of losing $2 million. 
Did you invest any of the money you were making  in your trading, or did you keep plowing it 
back into your own account?

Chunk 2752 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
back into your own account? 
I made a number of bad investments and lost a fair ly large chunk of the mone y I had made trading. 
When I was trading big, I wanted to have a reason to  keep doing it, so I just spent money wildly. At 
one time, I owned about ten houses and ended up losing money on all of them. Some I sold before I 
had even spent a single ni ght in them. I had a plane charter serv ice and lost a lot of money on that.

Chunk 2753 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
At one point, I figured out that for every dolla r I made trading, 30 pe rcent was going to the 
government, 30 percent was going to support my pl anes, and 20 percent was going to support my 
real estate. So I finally d ecided to sell everything. 
It sounds like as wise as you were as a trader, you were naive as an investor. 
Yes, I was incredibly naive. Out of a fairly large number of real estate transactions—many in

Chunk 2754 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
California—I lost money on all but one of them. I am probably the only pers on alive that can claim 
that dubious distinction. 
Why do you think you did so poorly on your investments? 
I would do everything emotionall y. I didn't analyze anything. 
In a sense, you were repeating the mistake of your early trading experi ence: getting involved 
in something you knew nothin g about and then losing mone y. Didn't any bells go off ? It

Chunk 2755 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
almost sounds like you had a self-destructive instinct in  losing your money elsewhere. 
Yes, absolutely. I probably lost more than half the money I made. 
During this period when you were doing all these unwise things, didn't anybody try to grab 
you by the shoulders and say, "Do you realize what you're doing?" 
Yes, but any time someone on my staff did, I woul d fire them. At one time, I was employing sixty

Chunk 2756 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
or seventy people, hi addition to all my money-lo sing businesses, I had a huge nut to make to just 
support the payroll. Frankly, a lot of the money I made just went down the drain. 
Did these losses have any of the emotional impact of losses in the market? The reason I ask is 
that you seem to talk about these in vestment losses very dispassionately. 
Yes, it hurt to realize what a fool  I had been, but I have learned not to be as attached to material

Chunk 2757 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
things. I accepted it as a life lesson. I learned I don' t have to own a house in every beautiful place in 
the world; I can stay at a hotel and walk on the beach  or climb a trail there. Or, if I really feel like 
spoiling myself, I can charter a plane; I don't have to own one. 
Right, that certainly makes sense,  but what I am getting at is that I suspect that if you had

Chunk 2758 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
lost the same amount of mo ney trading, it would have been a much more traumatic  25experience. Is that because your ego wasn 't attached to these other ventures? 
Yes, I'm sure that's true. I always felt that, at leas t, I was smart at one thing. I feel like trading is the 
only thing I am really good at. If not for that , I probably would have wound up shining shoes. 
Do you think being a great tr ader is an innate skill?

Chunk 2759 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I think to be in the upper echelon of successful traders requires an innate skill, a gift. It's just like 
being a great violinist. But to be a competen t trader and make money is a skill you can learn. 
Having been through the whole trading experi ence from failure to extreme success, what 
basic advice could you give a begi nning trader or a losing trader? 
The first thing I would say is al ways bet less than 5 percent of  your money on any one idea. That

Chunk 2760 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
way you can be wrong more than twenty times; it will take you a long time to  lose your money. I 
would emphasize that the 5 percent applies to on e idea. If you take a long position in two different 
related grain markets, that is still one idea. 
The next thing I would advise is to always use stops. I mean actually put them in, because that 
commits you to get ou t at a certain point. 
Do you always pick a point where you will get out before you get in?

Chunk 2761 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yes, I have always done that. You have to. 
I would imagine in your case you can't actually put a stop in because your orders are too 
large. 
Yes, but my broker can hold it. 
When you place an order to get into a position , is it accompanied by an order to get out? 
That's right. Another thing is that  if a position doesn't feel right  as soon as you put it on, don't be 
embarrassed to change your mind and get right out.

Chunk 2762 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
So, if you put the trade on and five minutes later it doesn't feel right, don't think to yourself, 
"If I get out this quickly, my brok er will think that  I'm an idiot." 
Yes, exactly. If you become unsure about a positi on, and you don't know what to do, just get out. 
You can always come back in. When in doubt, ge t out and get a good night's sleep. I've done that 
lots of times and the next day everything was clear. 
Do you sometimes go back in right after you get out?

Chunk 2763 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yes, often the next day. While you are in, you can't think. When you get out, then you can think 
clearly again. 
What other advice would you give the novice trader? 
Perhaps the most important rule is  to hold on to your winners and cu t your losers. Both are equally 
important. If you don't stay with your winners, you ar e not going to be able to pay for the losers. 
You also have to follow your own light. Because I ha ve so many friends who are talented traders, I

Chunk 2764 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
often have to remind myself that if I try to trade their way, or on  their ideas, I am going to lose. 
Every trader has strengths and weaknesses. Some  are good holders of winners, but may hold their 
losers a little too long. Others may cut their winners a little short, bu t are quick to take their losses. 
As long as you stick to your own style, you get the good and bad in your own approach. When you

Chunk 2765 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
try to incorporate someone else's style, you often wind up w ith the worst of both styles. I've done 
that a lot. 
Is it a problem because you don't have the same type of confidence in a trade that isn't yours? 
Exactly, hi the final analysis, you need to have the courage to hold the position and take the risk. If 
it comes down to "I'm in this trade because Brace is in it," then you are not going to have the 
courage to stick with it. So you might as  well not be in it in the first place.

Chunk 2766 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Do you still talk to other traders about markets? 
Not too much. Over the years, it has mostly cost me money. When I talk to other traders, I try to 
keep very conscious of the idea that  I have to listen to myself. I tr y to take their information without 
getting overly influenced by their opinion. 
I assume that we are talking about very ta lented traders, and it still doesn't make a  26difference. If it is not your own idea, it messes up your trading?

Chunk 2767 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Right. You need to be aware that the world is very sophisticated and always ask yourself: "How 
many people are left to act on this  particular idea?" You have to consider whether the market has 
already discounted your idea. 
How can you possibly evaluate that? 
By using the classic momentum-type indicators and observing market tone. How many days has the 
market been down or up in a row? What is the reading on the sentiment indexes?

Chunk 2768 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Can you think of any good examples of ma rket tone tipping you off on a trade? 
The most classic illustration I can think of is one of the soybean bull markets in the late 1970s. At 
the time, soybeans were in extreme shortage. On e of the things pushing the market up was the 
weekly government reports indicating strong export  commitments and sales. I was holding a heavy 
long position in soybeans and someone from Comm odities Corporation called me with the latest

Chunk 2769 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
export figures. He said, "I have good news and I have bad news." I said, "OK, what is the good 
news?" "The good news is that the export commitmen t figure was fantastic. The bad news is that 
you don't have a limit position [the maximum permissible specula tive position size]." They were 
expecting the market to be limit-up for the next three days. 
Actually, I wound up being a little depressed that I didn't have a la rger position. The next morning,

Chunk 2770 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I entered an order to buy some more contract s on the opening, just in case I got lucky and the 
market traded before locking limit-up. I sat back  to watch the fun. The market opened limit-up as 
expected. Shortly after the opening,  I noticed a lot of ticks being recorded, as if the market was 
trading at the limit-up. Then prices eased off limit- up just as my broker called to report my fills. 
The market started trading down. I said to my self, "Soybeans were supposed to be limit-up for

Chunk 2771 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
three days, and they can't even hold limit-up the first morning." I immediately called my broker and 
frantically told him to sell, sell, sell! 
Did you get out of your whole position? 
Not only that, but I was so excited that I lost coun t of how much I was sell ing. I accidentally wound 
up being short a substantial amount  of soybeans, which I bought b ack 40 to 50 cents lower. That 
was the only time I made a lot of money on an error.

Chunk 2772 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I remember a situation just like that. It was the cotton bull market when prices almost 
reached $1 a pound. To this day, I recall  I was long cotton and the week's export figure came 
out showing a half million bales of  exports to China. It was the most bullish cotton export figure I 
had ever seen. But instead of opening limit-up th e next day, the market opened only about 150 
points higher and then started trading o ff. That proved to be the exact high.

Chunk 2773 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Another interesting example, I remember, occurred wh en we were in a very inflationary period and 
all the commodity markets were trading in lock step fashion. On one particularly powerful day, 
almost all the markets went limit-up. On that day, cotton opened limit-up, fell back, and finished 
only marginally higher for the day. That was the ma rket peak. Everything else stayed locked limit-
up, but cotton never saw the light of day again.

Chunk 2774 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
up, but cotton never saw the light of day again. 
Is the implied rule that if you find a common be havior between markets,  you want to sell the 
one that is lagging as soon as it starts heading down? 
You absolutely want to put down a bet when a market acts terrib ly relative to everything else. 
When the news is wonderful and a market can't go up, then you want to be sure to be short. 
What kinds of misconceptions about th e markets get people into trouble?

Chunk 2775 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Well, I think the leading cause of financial disablem ent is the belief that you can rely on the experts 
to help you. It might, if you know the right expert. For example, if you happen to be Paul Tudor 
Jones' barber, and he is talking about the market , it might not be a bad id ea to listen. Typically, 
however, these so-called "experts" are not traders. Your average broker couldn't be a trader in a

Chunk 2776 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
million years. More money is lost listening to brokers than any other way. Trading requires an 
intense personal involvement. You have to do your  own homework, and that  is what I advise 
people to do. 
Any other misconceptions?  27The foolish belief that there is c onspiracy in the markets. I have known many of the great traders in 
the world, and I can say that 99 percent of the ti me, the market is bigger than anybody and, sooner

Chunk 2777 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
or later, it goes where it wants to go. Ther e are exceptions, but they  don't last too long. 
You have attributed a lot of your success to Ed and Amos who taught you the principles of 
trading. Have you, in turn, taught other traders? 
Yes. My best result, in terms of his becoming the best trader I ever  worked with, as well as being a 
close friend, is Bruce Kovner. 
How much of his success do you attribute to your training, and how much of it was just his own 
talent?

Chunk 2778 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
talent?  
When I first met Bruce, he was a writer and a pr ofessor; in his spare time, he was doing some 
trading. I was staggered by the breadth of tradi ng knowledge he had accumulated in such a short 
time. I remember the first day I met Bruce I tried to impress him with complicated concepts. Here I 
was, a professional trader who, in those days, sp ent fifteen hours a day trading and analyzing the

Chunk 2779 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
markets, and I couldn't come up with anything that  he couldn't understand. I recognized his talent 
immediately. 
That relates to his intellect, but was there some thing about him that told you that he was 
going to be a good trader? 
Yes, his objectivity. A good trader can't be rigi d. If you can find somebody who is really open to 
seeing anything, then you have found the raw ingred ient of a good trader—and I saw that in Bruce

Chunk 2780 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
right away. I knew from the moment I first met him that he was going to be a great trader. What I 
tried to do was convey to Brace the principles that  Ed and Amos had taught me, along with some of 
my acquired skills. My best trading occurred when  Brace and I were collaborating; we did some 
phenomenal trading. There were years when I was up 300 percent and he was up 1,000 percent. He 
had a very great gift. 
Do you feel you get ground down as a trader?

Chunk 2781 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Do you feel you get ground down as a trader? 
Absolutely. Around 1983,1 began to taper off in my tr ading. I felt that I ne eded to recharge my 
batteries. 
How important is gut feel in trading? 
Gut feel is very important. I don't know of any great professional trader that doesn't have it. Being a 
successful trader also take s courage: the courage to try, the cour age to fail, the courage to succeed, 
and the courage to keep on going when the going gets tough.

Chunk 2782 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Do you have any goals aside from trading at this point? 
I have taken karate for many years.  I am already at a high level, but I would like to get the black 
belt. Also, I have made a study of spiritual traditi ons and there is a bit more work I would like to do 
with that. 
You sound very vague about it. Do you want to be vague? 
It is very hard to talk about this. Let me see how I can put it. Albert Einstein said that the single

Chunk 2783 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
most important question is whether the universe is friendly. I think it is important for everybody to 
come to a point where they feel in side that the universe is friendly. 
Are you there now? 
I'm a lot closer. 
But that's not where you started off ? 
No. I started off with the feeling that it was an unfriendly place. 
Do you see yourself trading ten or twenty years from now? 
Yes, it's too much fun to give up. I don't want to make a lot more money. I would probably just end

Chunk 2784 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
up losing it in real estate again. 
Is the fun aspect still there if you are doing it thirteen hours a day? 
No. If trading is your life, it is a torturous kind of excitement. But if you are keeping your life in 
balance, then it is fun. All the succ essful traders I've seen that last ed in the busines s sooner or later  28got to that point. They have a balanced life; they have fun outside of trading. You can't sustain it if

Chunk 2785 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
you don't have some other focus. Eventually, you wind up overtrading or getting excessively 
disturbed about temporary failures. 
When you do hit a losing st reak, how do you handle it? 
In the past, I've sometimes tried to fight back by trading even heavier afte r I start losing, but that 
usually doesn't work. Then I start cutting down very fast to the point of stopping completely if it 
gets bad enough. But usually it never gets that bad.

Chunk 2786 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Do you sometimes manage to fight your way out of it? 
Sometimes, but most of the time I would have been better off if I had just stopped. I've had trouble 
bringing myself to do that, beca use I am a natural fighter. The t ypical pattern is: Lose, fight like 
hell, lose again, then cut back, or so metimes stop, until I get on a winning track. 
How long have you stopped for? 
Usually three, four weeks.

Chunk 2787 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Usually three, four weeks. 
When you are in a losing streak, is it because you are out of sync  with the markets, or is there 
a better way to describe it? 
I think that, in the end, losing begets losing. When you start losing, it touches off negative elements 
in your psychology; it leads to pessimism. 
There are very few traders who have been as su ccessful as you. What do you think makes you 
different?

Chunk 2788 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
different? 
I am very open-minded. I am willing to take in in formation that is difficult to accept emotionally, 
but which I still recognize to be tr ue. For example, I have seen others make money much faster than 
I have only to wind up giving everything back, becau se when they started losing, they couldn't stop. 
When I have had a bad losing streak, I have been able to say to myself, "You just can't trade

Chunk 2789 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
anymore." When a market moves counter to my exp ectations, I have always been able to say, "I 
had hoped to make a lot of money in this pos ition, but it isn't working, so I'm getting out." 
Do you keep track of your equity on a d ay-to-day basis? Do you actually plot it? 
I have done that a lot in the past. 
Is that helpful? Do you think it's a good idea for traders to plot their equity?

Chunk 2790 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I think so. If the trend in your equ ity is down, that is a sign to cut back and reevaluate. Or if you see 
that you are losing money a lot faster than  you made it, that would be a warning. 
Are there any advisors you pay attention to? 
My favorite market letter in terms of readabilit y, imagination, and knowledge of the subject is the 
California Technology Stock Letter (CTSL Publishing Partners, 155 Montgomery Street, Suite

Chunk 2791 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
1401, San Francisco, CA 94104). I also like the market lett ers put out by Marty Zweig 
(TheZweigLetter, The Zweig Forecast, P.O. Box 360, Bellmore, NY 11710) and Richard Russell 
(Dow Theory Letters, Dow Theory Letters Inc., P. O. Box 1759, LaJolla, CA 92038). 
Of the traders I have interviewed, Zweig is probably the one most mentioned. 
You always get something of value out of Marty Zweig. He is very solid.

Chunk 2792 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Judging by the letters you have mentioned, I take  it that you trade stoc ks as well. How long 
have you been trading stocks? 
For about the last two years. 
Do you trade stocks differen tly than you trade futures? 
I'm more patient. 
Is the selection process different? 
No, I look for confirmation from the chart, the f undamentals, and the mark et action. I think you can 
trade anything in th e world that way. 
Do you focus on any particular types of stock?

Chunk 2793 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Do you focus on any particular types of stock? 
I don't trade the Dow stocks. I pref er the little ones, because th ey are not dominated by the big  29professional traders who are like sharks eating each ot her. The basic principle is that it is better to 
trade the Australian dollar than the Deutsche ma rk, and the small OTC stock than the big Dow 
stock. 
What are the fundamentals you look for in a stock?

Chunk 2794 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I like to use something I found in Investor's Daily: the earnings per share (EPS). [The EPS ranking 
is based on comparing the earnings per share growth of a stock relative to all other stocks. For more 
details on the EPS, see the William O'Neil and David Ryan interviews.] I combine the EPS with my 
own sense of market share potential. If a company has already saturated their little niche in the

Chunk 2795 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
world, a high EPS is not that important. But, in t hose issues where the EPS is growing, and there is 
still plenty of pie out there, the situation is much more attractive. 
I also like to look at the price/earnings (P/E) ratio  in conjunction with the EPS. hi other words, 
while I like to see a company with a strong earnings growth pattern, I also wa nt to know how much 
the market is paying for that earnings growth pattern. 
So you like seeing a high EPS with a low P/E.

Chunk 2796 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
So you like seeing a high EPS with a low P/E. 
Yes. That's the best combination. I am sure ther e is a way of combining the two on a computer and 
coming up with a very good system. 
How about the relative strength [a measure of a stock's price p erformance relative to all other 
stocks], which is anot her key indicator in Investor's Daily!  
I don't think that helps that much. Relative st rength tells you what a st ock has already done.

Chunk 2797 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Frequently, by the time you get a high relative strength figure, th e stock has exhausted itself. 
Is there anything else you look for in a stock? 
I look at the basic industry. For example, right now [May 1988], I ha ppen to be bullish on tanker 
rates and, therefore, the shipping business. 
For what reasons? 
Supply and demand. Tanker rates are like commodity pr ices; they follow a clas sic cyclical pattern.

Chunk 2798 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Prices get high and everyone makes a lot of money, so they build a lot of ships and prices go down. 
Eventually the ships are scrapped and prices go back up again. We have had very low rates for 
many years and have scrapped a lot of tankers annua lly. So we are entering th at part of the cycle 
where prices go back up again. 
Does trading become more difficult as the size of the account gets bigger?

Chunk 2799 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yes, because you are forced to compete in fewer and fewer markets that are being traded by other 
big professionals. 
How much common behavior is there between di fferent markets? For example, can you trade 
bonds in the same way you trade corn? 
I really feel that if you can trad e one market, you can trade them a ll. The! principles are the same. 
Trading is emotion. It is mass ps ychology, greed, and fear . It is all the same in every situation.

Chunk 2800 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
For most great traders, early failure is more the rule than the exception. De spite an incredible long-
term performance record, Michael Marcus bega n his trading career with an unbroken string of 
trading losses. Moreover, he wiped out not just once, but several times. The moral is: Early trading 
failure is a sign that you are do ing something wrong; it is not necessarily a good predictor of 
ultimate potential failure or success.

Chunk 2801 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
ultimate potential failure or success. 
I found it particularly interesting that, despite a number of painfu l trading losses, Marcus' most 
devastating experience was actuall y a profitable trade in which he  got out prematurely. Taking 
advantage of potential major winning trades is not only important to the mental health of the trader, 
but is also critical to winn ing. In the interview, Marcus stressed that letting winners ride is every bit

Chunk 2802 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
as important as cutting losses short. In his own words, "If you don't stay with your winners, you are 
not going to be able to pay for the losers." 
Marcus learned about the dangers of overtrading the hard way. In one instance (the grain trade in 
the nonexistent corn blight year), an account he had built up from a very small stake to $30,000 was 
wiped out by betting all his mone y on a single trade. He made the same mistake a second time in

Chunk 2803 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the lumber market, coming to the brink of disa ster before narrowly escaping. These experiences  30had a dramatic impact on Marcus' trading philosophy. It is no accident that the first rule he cites 
when asked to give advice to the average trader  is: Never commit more than 5 percent of your 
money to a single trade idea. 
In addition to not overtrading, Ma rcus stresses the importance of committing to an exit point on

Chunk 2804 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
every trade. He feels that protec tive stops are very important beca use they force this commitment 
on the trader. He also recommends liquidating pos itions to achieve mental clarity when one is 
losing money and is confused regarding market decisions. 
Marcus also emphasizes the necessity of followi ng your own mind as a trader. He suggests that 
following the advice of others, even when they are good traders, often leads to problems as it 
combines the worst elements of both traders.

Chunk 2805 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
combines the worst elements of both traders. 
Finally, despite being an aggressi ve trader, Marcus strongly beli eves in being restrictive in 
selecting trades. He advises waiting for those trad es in which all the key elements line up in one 
direction. By doing so you greatly enhance the pr obability of success on each trade. Making lots of 
trades when the conditions appear to be only margin ally in favor of the trade idea has more to do 
with entertainment than trading success.

31Bruce Kovner-The World Trader 
Today, Bruce Kovner may well be the world's larges t trader in the interbank currency and futures 
markets. In 1987 alone, he scored profits in ex cess of $300 million for himself and the fortunate 
investors in his funds. During th e past ten years, Kovner has re alized a remarkable 87 percent 
averaged annual compounded return. Two thousand dollars invested with Kovner in early 1978 
would have been worth over $1,000,000 ten years later.

Chunk 2807 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Despite his incredible track record and huge trading size, Kovner has managed to keep a 
surprisingly low profile. He ha s assiduously pursued his privacy by stea dfastly refusing all 
interview requests. "You might be  wondering why I consented to th is interview," he said. As a 
matter of fact, I was, but I did not want to ra ise the question. I had assumed that his agreement 
reflected a vote of confidence and trust. Seven year s earlier, our paths had crossed briefly when we

Chunk 2808 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
both worked at Commodities Corpora tion—he as one of the firm's princi pal traders, I as an analyst. 
Kovner continued, "It seems like I can't avoid some  publicity, and the stories are usually distorted 
and fanciful. I thought that this interview would help establish at leas t one accurate record." 
Kovner hardly fits the intuitive im age of a trader who typically holds positions with a total face

Chunk 2809 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
value measured in billions of do llars. With his incisive intellect  and easygoing manner, he reminds 
one more of a professor than a giant-scale trad er in the highly leveraged currency and futures 
markets. Indeed, Kovner started out as an academic. 
After graduating from Harvard, Kovner taught pol itical science courses at Harvard and the 
University of Pennsylvania. Although he liked teaching, he was not enthused with the academic

Chunk 2810 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
life. "I didn't enjoy the process of  always confronting a blank page in the morning and thinking of 
something brilliant to write." 
In the early 1970s, Kovner managed a number of po litical campaigns, with the idea of eventually 
running for office himself. He abandoned politics becau se he didn't have the financial resources, or 
the desire to work his way up the political ladder from committee jobs. During this time he also 
worked as a consultant for vari ous state and federal agencies.

Chunk 2811 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Still searching for a career dire ction, Kovner shifted his attention to the financial markets in the 
mid-1970s. He believed that his economics and political scienc e education provided the right 
background, and he found the idea of analyzing the world to make  trading judgments tremendously 
appealing. For about a year, Ko vner immersed himself in studyi ng markets and the related 
economic theory. He read everything he could get his hands on.

Chunk 2812 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
One subject he studied intensively was inte rest rate theory. "I fell in love with uieyield curve." [The 
yield curve is the relationship between the yi eld on government securities and their time to 
maturity. For example, if each successively long er-term maturity provided a higher yield than a 
shorter-term maturity—for example,  five-year T-notes at a higher yield than one-year T-bills—the 
yield curve would reflect a cont inually rising slope on a graph.]

Chunk 2813 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Kovner's study of the interest rate ma rkets coincided with the initial ye ars of trading in interest rate 
futures. At that time, the interest rate futu res market was relatively unsophisticated and price 
distortions, which would be quick ly eradicated by arbitrageurs today, persisted over time. As 
Kovner explains it, "The market hadn't beco me important enough for CitiBank or Solomon 
Brothers, but it was impo rtant enough for me."

Chunk 2814 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Brothers, but it was impo rtant enough for me." 
One of the primary anomalies Kovner discovered was related to the price spread (difference) 
between different futures contracts. Futures are tr aded for specific months (for example, March, 
June, September, and December). Given the prevaili ng phase of the business cycle, interest rate 
theory predicted that the nearby contract (for exam ple, March) should trade at a higher price (lower

Chunk 2815 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
yield) than the next contract (for example, J une). Although the nearest tw o contracts did indeed 
tend to reflect this relationship, Kovner found th at the price difference between more forward 
contracts often started trading at  near-zero levels. His first trad e involved buying a forward interest 
rate contract and selling a more fo rward contract, in the expectation that, as the purchased contract

Chunk 2816 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
became the nearby contract with the passage of tim e, the price spread be tween the two contracts 
would widen. 
That first trade worked just according to text book theory and Kovner was hooked as a trader. His 
second trade also involved an intra-market spread [the purchase of one contra ct against the sale of  32another contract in the same market]. In this case, he bought the nearby c opper contract and sold a

Chunk 2817 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
more forward contract, in the expectation that  supply tightness would cause the nearby copper 
contract to gain relative to the forward positi on. Although his idea eventually proved right, he was 
too early and lost money on that trade. At the e nd of these two trades, K ovner was still ahead, with 
his original $3,000 stake ha ving grown to about $4,000. 
My third trade is what really put me in the business. In early  1977, an apparent shortage was

Chunk 2818 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
developing in the soybean market. It was a demand driven market. Every week the crush was 
higher than expected and nobody believed the figur es. [The crush is the amount of soybeans 
processed for use as soybean meal and soybean oil.] I was watching the July/November spread [the 
price difference between the old cr op July contract and the new cr op November contract]. Since it 
looked like we were going to run out of soybeans, I thought that the old crop July contract would

Chunk 2819 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
expand its premium to the new crop November contra ct. This spread had been  trading in a narrow 
consolidation near 60-cen ts premium July. I figured I could eas ily stop myself out just below the 
consolidation at around a 45-cents premium. At the time, I didn't realize how volat ile the spread 
could be. I put on one spread [t hat is, bought July soybeans and simultaneously sold November 
soybeans] near 60 cents and it widened to 70 cents. Then I put on another spread. I kept on

Chunk 2820 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
pyramiding. 
How big of a position did you build up? 
I eventually built up to a position of about fifteen contracts, but not before I had to switch brokerage 
firms. When I started out, I wa s trading at a small brokerage hous e. The head of the company, who 
was an old floor trader, went ove r the trades every day and spotte d what I was doing. By that time, 
I had built my position up to about ten or fifteen contracts. The margin  on a single outright contract

Chunk 2821 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
was $2,000, while the spread margin was only $400. 
He told me, "The spread position you have on trades like an outright long position. I am going to 
raise your margins from $400 to $2,000 per contract."  [Spread margins are lower than outright 
margins, reflecting the assumption that a net l ong or short position will be considerably more 
volatile than a spread position. Reason: In a spr ead, the long contract portion of the position is

Chunk 2822 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
likely to at leas t partially offset price movement  in the short contract position. In a shortage 
situation, however, an intercrop spread, su ch as long July soybeans/sh ort November soybeans can 
prove to be nearly as volatile as a net long or short position.] 
He was obviously quite concerned with the risk in your position. 
Yes. He was concerned that I had only put up $400 margin per spread, on a spread which behaved 
like a net long position. 
Actually, he wasn't that far off.

Actually, he wasn't that far off. 
He was right, but I was furious. So I moved my account to another brokerage firm, which shall 
remain nameless, for reasons that will soon become clear. 
You were furious because you felt he was being unfair, or— 
Well, I am not sure I thought he was being unfair,  but I certainly knew he was an obstacle to my 
objective. I moved my account to a major brokera ge house, and got a broker who was not very

Chunk 2824 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
competent. The market kept moving up and I kept  adding to my positi on. I had put on my first 
spread on February 25; by April 12, my account was up to $35,000. 
Were you just adding to your position as the market went up, or did you have some plan? 
I had a plan. I would wait until th e market moved up to a certain level and then retraced by a 
specified amount before adding another unit. My pyramiding did not turn out to be the problem.

Chunk 2825 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The market had entered a string of limit-up moves.  On April 13, the market hit a new record high. 
The commotion was tremendous. My broker called me at home and said, "Soybeans are going to 
the moon. It looks like July is going limit-up, and N ovember is sure to follow. You are a fool to 
stay short the November contract s. Let me lift your November shorts for you, and when the market 
goes limit-up for the next few days, you will make  more money." I agreed, and we covered my

Chunk 2826 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
November short position. 
ALL of it?!  33All of it [he laughs loudly]. 
Was this a spur of the moment decision? 
It was a moment of insanity. Fift een minutes later, my broker calls me back, and he sounds frantic. 
"I don't know how to tell you this, but the market is limit-downl I don't know if I can get you out." I 
went into shock. I yelled at him to get me out. The market moved off of limit-down by a little bit 
and I got out. 
Did you end up getting out at limit-down?

Chunk 2827 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Did you end up getting out at limit-down? 
I got out between limit-down and slightly above limit-down. I can tell you the dimensions of the 
loss. At the moment I covered my short November  position leaving myself net long July, I was up 
about $45,000. By the end of the day, I had $22,000 in  my account. I went into emotional shock. I 
could not believe how stupid I had been—how badly I had failed to understand the market, in spite

Chunk 2828 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
of having studied the markets for years. I was sick to my stom ach, and I didn't eat for days. I 
thought that I had blown my career as a trader. 
But you still had $22,000 compared to your origin al stake of only $3,000. Keeping things in 
perspective, you were still in pretty good shape. 
Absolutely. I was in good shape, but— 
Was it the stupidity of the mist ake or was it the money that you  had given back that caused 
such emotional pain?

Chunk 2829 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
such emotional pain? 
No, it wasn't the money at all. I think it was the r ealization that there really  was "fire" there. Until 
then, I had ridden $3,000 to $45,000 without a moment of pain. 
On the way up, did you think, "This is easy"? 
It was easy. 
Did you give any thought to th e possibility that the market streak could eventually go the 
other way? 
No, but clearly, my decision to lift the short side of my spread pos ition in the middle of a panic

Chunk 2830 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
showed a complete disregard for risk. I think what  bothered me so much wa s the realization that I 
had lost a process of rationality that I thought I had. At that moment, I realized that the markets 
were truly capable of taking money aw ay every bit as fast as they ga ve it to you. That made a very 
strong impression on me. Actually, I wa s very lucky to get out with $22,000. 
I assume that your quick action that d ay probably averted a complete disaster.

Chunk 2831 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Absolutely. After that day, the market went strai ght down as fast as it had gone up. Perhaps, if I 
hadn't made my stupid mistake, I might have made the mistake of riding the market down. 
What eventually happened to the spread? 
The spread collapsed. Eventually, it went belo w the level that I had first begun buying it at. 
Since you liquidated your position on the day the market and the spread topped, you would

Chunk 2832 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
have given back a portion of the profits even if  it wasn't for the disastrous decision that 
forced you out of the market. 
That may be true, but for me, that was my "going bust" trade. It was the closest I ever came to 
going bust and, psychologically, it felt as if I had. 
Was that your most painful trade? 
Yes. Far and away. 
Even though you actually ended up making a substantial amount of money on the trade?

Chunk 2833 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I multiplied my money by nearly sixfold on that trad e. I was, of course, insanely leveraged, and I 
didn't understand how risky my position was. 
Was getting out of your entire position immedi ately after your broker ca lled to tell you the

I'm not sure. At that moment, I was confronted with  the realization that I ha d blown a great deal of

Do you have a recent example? 
October 19,1987—the week of the stock market cras h. I closed out all my positions on October 19

Let's get back to the period after your soybean trade. When did you start trading again? 
About a month later. After a few months I had my account back to about $40,000. Around that 
time, I answered an ad for a trading assist ant position at Commodities Corporation. I was

Chunk 2836 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
interviewed by Michael Marcus in his usual id iosyncratic manner. He had me return to 
Commodities Corporation several we eks later. "Well," he said, "I have some good news and some 
bad news. The bad news is that we are not hiring  you as a trading assistan t; the good news is that 
we are hiring you as a trader." 
How much money did Commodities Corporation give you to trade? 
Thirty-five thousand dollars. 
Were you trading your own money, as well, at the same time?

Chunk 2837 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yes, and that is something I am very glad about. Commodities Corporation had a policy that 
allowed you to trade your pers onal account, as well as the comp any account, and Michael and I 
were very aggressive traders. 
Were you influenced by Michael? 
Oh, yes, very much. Michael taught me one th ing that was incredibly important [pause]. 
That is a great lead-in. What is the punch line? 
He taught me that you could make a million dollars. He showed me that if you applied yourself,

Chunk 2838 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
great things could happen. It is very easy to  miss the point that you really  can do it. He showed me 
that if you take a position and use discipline, you can actually make it. 
It sounds like he gave you confidence. 
Right. He also taught me one other thing that is ab solutely critical: You have  to be willing to make 
mistakes regularly; there is not hing wrong with it. Michael taught me about making your best

Chunk 2839 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
judgment, being wrong, making your next best judgment, being wrong, making your third best 
judgment, and then doubling your money. 
You are one of the most succe ssful traders in the world. There are only a small number of 
traders of your caliber. What make s you different from the average guy? 
I'm not sure one can really define why some trad ers make it, while others do not. For myself, I can

Chunk 2840 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
think of two important elements. First, I have th e ability to imagine configurations of the world 
different from today and really believe it can ha ppen. I can imagine that soybean prices can double 
or that the dollar can fall to 100 yen. Second, I stay rational and disc iplined under pressure. 
Can trading skills be taught? 
Only to a limited extent. Over the years, I have trie d to train perhaps thirty people, and only four or 
five of those have turned out to be good traders.

Chunk 2841 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
What happened to the other twenty-five? 
They are out of the business—and it had nothing to do with intelligence. 
When you compare the trainees th at made it to the majority that did not, do you find any 
distinguishing traits? 
They are strong, independent, and contrary in the extreme. They are able to take positions others 
are unwilling to take. They are di sciplined enough to take the right  size positions. A greedy trader

Chunk 2842 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
always blows out. I know some real ly inspired traders who never ma naged to keep the money they 
made. One trader at Commodities Corporation—I don't want to mention his name—always struck 
me as a brilliant trader. The ideas he came up with  were wonderful; the markets he picked were  35often the right markets. Intellect ually, he knew markets much better  than I did, yet I was keeping 
money, and he was not. 
So where was he going wrong?

Chunk 2843 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
So where was he going wrong? 
Position size. He traded much too big. For every one contract I traded, he  traded ten. He would 
double his money on two different occasions  each year, but still end up flat. 
Do you always use fundamental analysis  in forming your trading decisions? 
I almost always trade on a market view; I don' t trade simply on technical information. I use 
technical analysis a great deal a nd it is terrific, but I can't hold  a position unless I understand why

Chunk 2844 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the market should move. 
Is that to say that virtually every position  you take has a fundamental reason behind it? 
I think that is a fair statement. But I would a dd that technical analysis  can often clarify the 
fundamental picture. I will give you an example. During the past six months, I had good arguments 
for the Canadian dollar going down, and good argumen ts for the Canadian dollar going up. It was

Chunk 2845 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
unclear to me which interpretation was correct. If you had put a gun to my head and forced me to 
choose a market direction, I probably would have said "down." 
Then the U.S ./Canadian trade pact was announced, which changed the entire picture, hi fact, the 
market had broken out on the upside a few days ear lier, as the negotiations  were finishing up. At 
that inSant, I felt completely comfortable saying th at one of the major pieces ii the valuation of the

Chunk 2846 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Canadian dollar had just changed, and the marlet had already voted. 
Prior to the agreement, I felt the Canadian dollar wa s at the top of a hill, a nd I wasn't sure whether 
it was going to roll backwads or forwards. When th e market moved, I was prepared to go with tlat 
movement because we had a conjunction of tw o important element!: a major change in 
fundamentals (although, I wasn't smart enough tc know  in which direction it would impact the

Chunk 2847 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
market), and a techncal price breakout on the upside. 
What do you mean you weren't smart enough to know in which direction the trade pact 
announcement would move the market? Since U. S./Canadian trade is so much a larger 
component of Canadian trade than it is of U.S. trade, wouldn't it hive been logical to assume 
that the trade pact would be bullish for the Canadian dollar? 
It didn't have to happen that way. I could just as easily have aigued that th e trade pact was negative

Chunk 2848 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
for the Canadian dollar because tie elimination of  the trade barriers would allow imports from the 
Ш. to submerge Canadian interests.  There are still some analysts w ho tdhere to that argument. My 
point is that there are well-inf ormed tralers who know much more than I do. I simply put things 
together. Tfey knew which way to go, and they voted in the marketplace by buying Canadian 
dollars. 
Is the generalization of that example that when an importart fundamental development

Chunk 2849 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
occurs, the initial direction of the marlet m ove is often a good tip-off of the longer-term 
trend? 
Exactly. The market usually leads because th ere are people Wio know more than you do. For 
example, the Soviet Union is a very gocd trader. 
Good trader in which markets? 
In currencies, and grains to some degree. 
How does one know what the Soviets are doing? 
Because the Soviets act through commercial banks and dealers, and you hear about it.

Chunk 2850 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
It seems rather contradictory to me that a country  that is so poor in running its own economy 
should be a good trader. 
Yes, but if you ask people in the busine ss, you will find out that they are.  
Why, or how? 
It is a joke, but perhaps they do read some of our mail. The Soviets (and other governments) 
occasionally have advance information. Why shouldn't they? They have the best developed

Chunk 2851 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
intelligence service in the world. It is a well k nown fact in the intelligence community that the  36Soviets (and others) are capable of eavesdroppi ng on commercial communication. That is why the 
large commodity trading firms sometimes use scra mblers when they are making very sensitive 
calls. 
My point is that there are thous ands of difficult-to-understand mechanisms that lead the market, 
which come into play before the news reaches so me poor trader sitting at his desk. But the one

Chunk 2852 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
thing that does hit the market is a huge sale or purchase. 
Isn't that the basic rationaliz ation for technical analysis? 
Technical analysis, I think, has a great deal that is right and a great deal  that is mumbo jumbo. 
That's an interesting statement. Wh at's right and what's black magic? 
There is a great deal of hype att ached to technical analysis by so me technicians who claim that it

Chunk 2853 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
predicts the future. Technical analysis tracks the pa st; it does not predict the future. You have to use 
your own intelligence to draw conclusions about what the past activity of some traders may say 
about the future activit y of other traders. 
For me, technical analysis is lik e a thermometer. Fundamentalists who say they are not going to pay 
any attention to the charts are like a doctor who says  he's not going to take a patient's temperature.

Chunk 2854 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
But, of course, that would be sheer folly. If you  are a responsible participant in the market, you 
always want to know where the market is—whether it is hot and excitable,  or cold and stagnant. 
You want to know everything you can about  the market to give you an edge. 
Technical analysis reflects the vote of the enti re marketplace and, theref ore, does pick up unusual 
behavior. By definition, anything th at creates a new chart pattern is something unusual. It is very

Chunk 2855 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
important for me to study the details of price ac tion to see if I can observe something about how 
everybody is voting. Studying the charts is absolutely crucial and alerts me to existing disequilibria 
and potential changes. 
Do you sometimes put on a trade because you look  at a chart and say, "I 've seen this pattern 
before, and it is often a forerunner of a market advance." That is, even though you may not 
have any fundamental reasons?

Chunk 2856 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
have any fundamental reasons? 
Yes, I will do that sometimes. I would only add that, as a trader who has seen a great deal and been 
in a lot of markets, there is not hing disconcerting to me about a pr ice move out of a trading range 
that nobody understands. 
Does that imply you usually go with breakouts? 
Sure. 
But the markets are often prone to false breako uts. There has to be more to it than that.

Chunk 2857 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Tight congestions in which a breakout occurs for reasons that nobody unders tands are usually good 
risk/reward trades. 
How about breakouts that occur b ecause there is a story in the Wall Street Journal that day? 
That would be much less relevant. The Heisenberg  principle in physics provides an analogy for the 
markets. If something is closely observed, the odds  are it is going to be al tered in the process. If

Chunk 2858 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
corn is in a tight consolidati on and then breaks out the day the Wall Street Journal carries a story 
about a potential shortage of corn, the odds of the price move being sustained are much smaller. If 
everybody believes there is no reason for corn to br eak out, and it suddenly does, the chances that 
there is an important underlying cause are much greater. 
It sounds like you are saying that the less expl anation there is for a price move occurring, the 
better it looks.

Chunk 2859 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
better it looks. 
Well, I do think that. The more a price pattern is  observed by speculators, the more prone you are to 
have false signals. The more a ma rket is the product of nonspecu lative activity, the greater the 
significance of technical breakouts. 
Has the greatly increased use of computerized trend-following systems increased the 
frequency of false technical signals? 
I think so. The fact that there are billions of dol lars out there trading on technical systems that use

Chunk 2860 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
moving averages or other simple pattern reco gnition approaches helps produce many more false  37signals. I have developed similar systems myself, so that I can tell when the other systems are 
going to kick in. If it is clear that prices are moving because th ese billions are kicking into the 
market, it is a lot less interest ing than if a breakout occurs because the Russians are buying. 
Let's say you do buy a market on an upside b reakout from a consolidation phase, and the

Chunk 2861 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
price starts to move against you—that is, back into the range. How do you know when to get 
out? How do you tell the difference betw een a small pullback and a bad trade? 
Whenever I enter a position, I have a predetermine d stop. That is the only way I can sleep. I know 
where I'm getting out before I get in. The position size on a trade is determined by the stop, and the 
stop is determined on a technical basis. For example, if the market is in the midst of a trading range,

Chunk 2862 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
it makes no sense to put your stop w ithin that range, since you are lik ely to be taken out. I always 
place my stop beyond some technical barrier. 
Don't you run into the problem that a lot of ot her people may be using the same stop point, 
and the market may be drawn to that stop level? 
I never think about that, because the point about a technical barrier—and I've studied the technical 
aspects of the market for a long time—is that the market shouldn't go there if you are right. I try to

Chunk 2863 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
avoid a point that floor traders can get at eas ily. Sometimes I may place my stop at an obvious 
point, if I believe that it is too far away or too difficult to reach easily. 
To take an actual example, on a recent Friday af ternoon, the bonds witne ssed a high-velocity 
breakdown out of an extended trading range. As fa r as I could tell, this price move came as a 
complete surprise. I felt very comfortable selling the bonds on the premise that if I was right about

Chunk 2864 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the trade, the market should not make it back through a certain amount of a previous overhead 
consolidation. That was my stop. I slept easily in that position, because I knew that I would be out 
of the trade if that happened. 
Talking about stops, I assume beca use of the size that you trade,  your stops are always mental 
stops, or is that not necessarily true? 
Let's put it this way: I've organize d my life so that the stops get ta ken care of. They are never on the

Chunk 2865 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
floor, but they are not mental. 
What eventually tells you that you are wrong on  a major position trade? Your stop point will 
limit your initial loss, but if you  still believe in the fundamental analysis underlying the trade, 
I assume that you will try it again. If you are wrong about the general direction of the market, 
won't you take a series of losse s? At what point do you throw in the towel on the trade idea?

Chunk 2866 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
First of all, a loss of money itself slows me down, so I reduce my positions. Secondly, in the 
situation you described, the change in the t echnical picture will give me second thoughts. For 
example, if I am bearish on the dollar and a majo r intermediate high has been penetrated, I would 
have to reevaluate my view. 
Earlier you mentioned that you had developed your own trend-following systems to provide 
an indicator of where the large amount of  money managed under such systems could be

Chunk 2867 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
expected to hit the market. Do you use your ow n trend-following systems to trade any portion 
of the money you manage? 
Yes, about 5 percent. 
Is that the level of your confiden ce? I guess it is not negative 5 percent, so it could be worse. 
Overall, my systems make money, but they have vol atility characteristics, and problems related to 
risk control that I don't like. But,  since they offer dive rsification from my ot her trading, I use them 
to a small degree.

Chunk 2868 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to a small degree. 
Do you feel it is possible to ever develop a system that would do as well as a good trader? 
I think it is unlikely because the learning features of such a system would have to be very highly 
developed. Computers are good at "lea rning" only when there are clear hierarchies of information 
and precedent. For example, expert systems for medical diagnostics are very good because the rules

Chunk 2869 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
are very clear. The problem with developing expert  systems for trading is that the "rules" of the 
trading and investment game keep  changing. I have spent some tim e working with expert system 
developers, and we concluded that  trading was a poor candidate for this approach, because trading  38decisions encompass too many types of knowledge, and the rules for interp reting the information 
keep changing.

Chunk 2870 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
keep changing. 
Does the fact that you are trad ing so much greater size than you did in your early years make 
it more difficult? 
There are far fewer markets with sufficient liquidity for the optimum size of my trades. 
How much money are you currently managing? 
Over $650 million. 
I assume more than half of that is due to capital appreciation. 
Yes, last year's profits alone were about $300 million.

Chunk 2871 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
What are some markets that you really have tro uble trading because of insufficient liquidity? 
An example of a market I like a great deal, but in  which the liquidity is often poor, is copper, hi 
copper, I am now the elephant. 
What kind of size can be moved comfortably in a market like copp er before it becomes a 
problem? 
I would say, in a day, you can comfortably move 500 to 800 contracts; uncomfortably, somewhat

Chunk 2872 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
more than that. But the daily volume of copper is  currently only 7,000 to 10,000 contracts and a lot 
of that is local trading or sp reads. In contrast, in the T-bond market, you can move 5,000 contracts 
without a problem. You can also move very la rge size, in the interbank currency market. 
Can you trade a market like coffee, which do esn't have deep liquidity, but sometimes can 
develop enormous trends?

Chunk 2873 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
develop enormous trends? 
Yes, I did trade coffee last year and made a few million dollars in it. Now, if I am managing $600 
million, and I kick in $2 million in profits on coff ee trades, it doesn't really matter that much. In 
fact, it could even be counterproductive, since the time and energy I spend concentrating on coffee 
diminishes my focus on the currency ma rkets, which I trade far more heavily.

Chunk 2874 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
It would appear that you have reached a size  level that impedes your trading performance. 
Since you have substantial personal funds, did you ever consider just trading your own 
money and avoiding all the related  headaches in managing money? 
Yes, but there are several reasons why I don't. A lthough I invest a great deal of my own money in 
my funds, the portion of my funds that is managed money represents a call. [Analogy to an option

Chunk 2875 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that has unlimited profit potential in  the event of a price rise, but risk  limited to its cost in the event 
of a decline.] I don't say this to be flippant, si nce my reputation among my investors is extremely 
important to me, but a call is  a much better position than a symmetrical win/lose position. 
Is there a practical limit to the amount of money you can manage? 
In most commodity futures markets, there certainly is. However, in currencies, interest rates, and a

Chunk 2876 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
few commodities such as crude oil, there are limits, but they are very  high. I plan to very carefully 
manage the future growth in the size of funds I am managing. 
When you put in orders in markets that are not among the most liquid—in other words, not 
T-bonds or the major currencies—do you find your orders actually moving the market? 
They can, but I never bully a market. 
Talking about that, one often hears stories about very large traders trying to push the

Chunk 2877 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
markets up or down. Does that work? 
I don't think so. It can be done for the short term, but eventually it will lead to serious mistakes. It 
usually results in arrogance and a loss of touc h with the underlying ma rket structure, both 
fundamentally and technically. The traders that I know who thought too highl y of their ability and 
tried to bully the market, ultimately made the mistake of overtrading and went under. 
Without mentioning any names, can you provide an example?

Chunk 2878 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
There is a recent example of a British trading orga nization getting into serious trouble after they 
tried to corner the crude oil market. At first they succeeded, but then they lost control and crude oil 
prices fell by $4.  39What was the end result? 
They lost about $40 million and the organization is in trouble. 
You are probably managing more money than an y other futures trader in the world. How do 
you handle the emotional strain when you hit a losing period?

Chunk 2879 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The emotional burden of trading is substantial; on  any given day, I could lose millions of dollars. If 
you personalize these losse s, you can't trade. 
Do the losses bother you at all anymore? 
The only thing that disturbs me is poor money ma nagement. Every so often, I take a loss that is 
significantly too large. But I neve r had a lot of difficulty with th e process of losi ng money, as long

Chunk 2880 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
as losses were the outcome of sound  trading techniques. Lifting the short side of the July/November 
soybean spread was an example that scared me. I learned a lot about risk control from that 
experience. But as a day-in, day-out pr ocess, taking losses does not bother me. 
Did you have any losing years? 
Yes, in 19811 lost about 16 percent. 
Was that due to errors you made, or the nature of the markets?

Chunk 2881 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
It was a combination of the two. My main problem was that it was the first major bear market in 
commodities I had experienced, and bear markets have  different characteristics than bull markets. 
Was it a matter of becoming complacent ab out markets always being in an uptrend? 
No, the problem was that the principal character istic of a bear market is very sharp down 
movements followed by quick retracements. I would always sell too late and then get stopped out

Chunk 2882 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
in what subsequently proved to be part of a wi de-swinging congestion pattern. In a bear market, 
you have to use sharp countertre nd rallies to enter positions. 
What other mistakes di d you make that year? 
My money management was poor. I had too many correlated trades. 
Was your confidence shaken at all that year ? Did you go back to the drawing board? 
I went back and designed a lot of risk manageme nt systems. I paid strict attention to the

Chunk 2883 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
correlations of all my positions. From that point on, I measured my total risk in the market every 
day. 
When you trade currencies, do you use the interbank market or the futures market? 
I only use the interbank market, unless I am doi ng an arbitrage trade against the /MM. [The 
International Monetary Market (IMM) is a subsid iary of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the 
world's foremost currency futures exchange.] The liquidity is enormously better, the transaction

Chunk 2884 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
costs are much lower, and it is a twenty-four-hour  market, which is important to us because we 
literally trade twen ty-four hours a day. 
What portion of your trading is in currencies? 
On average, about 50 to 60 percent of our profits come from currency trading. 
I assume you are also trading currencies beyond th e five that are currently actively traded on 
the IMM. 
We trade any currency that is highly liquid. Virtua lly all the European currencies (including those

Chunk 2885 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
of the Scandinavian countries), all the major Asian currencies and the Mideast currencies. Crosses 
are probably the most important trading vehicle that we use that you can't trade on the IMM. 
[Crosses are a trade involving two foreign co untries. For example, buying British pounds and 
selling an equal dollar amount of Deutsche marks is a cross.] Y ou can't trade crosses on the IMM 
because they have fixed contract sizes.

Chunk 2886 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
because they have fixed contract sizes. 
But you could do a cross on the IMM by adju sting the ratio of the number of contracts 
between the two currencies to equalize the dollar value of each position. 
But it is much more exact and direct to use the interbank market. Fo r example, Deutsche 
mark/British pound and Deutsche mark/Japanese yen crosses are highly traded and very active.

Chunk 2887 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I assume that when you do a mark/yen cross, you price it in dollars, not in terms of one of the  40two currencies. 
That's right. You simply say: Buy $100 [million] worth of marks and sell $100 [million] worth of 
yen. In the interbank market, the dollar is  the unit of exchange all over the world. 
In situations where a surprise news development or the release of an economic statistic out of 
line with expectations causes a sharp price resp onse in currencies, does the interbank market

Chunk 2888 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
react less violently than the futures market, or do the arbitrageurs keep the two markets 
tightly linked? 
The two markets are well arbitraged, but those are the moments when a very swift arbitrageur will 
make some money. The markets do get a li ttle bit out of line, but not a lot. 
Will the interbank market price response to such events be less extreme? 
Yes, because what happens on the futures market is that the locals back aw ay and let the stops run.

Chunk 2889 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The only thing that pulls the markets back is the arbitrageurs who have the bank on the other side. 
What percentage of bank market trading repres ents commercial activity, or hedging, vis-a-
vis speculative trades? 
The Fed has done a study on that. I don't have th e figures on hand, but it is  basically a hedging 
market. The banks are the principal speculato rs, as well as a few players like myself. 
Is there a reason why the futures market hasn't been able to capture a larger percentage of

Chunk 2890 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
world currency trading? 
The currency futures market is not efficient in seve ral of the most important respects. First, hedging 
usually has a specific dollar and date requirement. For example, if I need to hedge $3.6 million for 
April 12, the bank just takes it. The futures mark et, however, trades only for specific dates and 
fixed contract sizes, so the he dger is not precisely covered. 
So actually there is no way the futures market  can compete, because the interbank market

Chunk 2891 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
can tailor a hedge for any customer. 
That's right. In addition, the activity takes pla ce within normal commercial banking relations. That 
is, very often, the hedger wants to show his banking in terest that he has a locked-in profit so he can 
borrow against it. 
Can you talk about your fundamental analysis methodology? How do you  determine what the 
right price for a market should be? 
I assume that the price for a market on any given da y is the correct price, th en I try to figure out

Chunk 2892 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
what changes are occurring th at will alter that price. 
One of the jobs of a good trader is to imagine a lternative scenarios. I try to form many different 
mental pictures of what the wo rld should be like and wait for one of them to be confirmed. You 
keep trying them on one at a time. Inevitably, most of these pictures will turn out to be wrong—that 
is, only a few elements of the picture may prove correct. But then, all of a sudden, you will find that

Chunk 2893 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
in one picture, nine out of ten elements click. That scenario th en becomes your image of the world 
reality. 
Let me give you an example. Th e Friday after the October 19 st ock market crash, I had trouble 
sleeping, which is very unusual for me. But I am su re I wasn't the only trad er to lie awake that 
night. All week long, I struggled with how the events  of that week were goi ng to impact the dollar.

Chunk 2894 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I was trying on different visions of the world. On e of these pictures was total panic—the world 
coming to an end, financially. 
In this scenario, the dollar becomes the safest po litical haven, and as a re sult, there could be a 
tremendous rise in the dollar. In fact, on Tuesday of  that week, the dollar did rise dramatically as 
many people withdrew their money from other pl aces. During the next three days, there was

Chunk 2895 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
tremendous confusion. By the end of the wee k, the dollar had starte d to give ground again. 
It was then that it all coales ced in my mind. It became absolute ly clear to me that given the 
combination of a need for stimul ative action, dictated by the trem endous worldwide financial panic, 
the reluctance of the Bank of Japan and German  Bundesbank to adopt pot entially inflationary 
measures, and the continuing wide U.S. trade defic its, the only solution was for Treasury Secretary

Chunk 2896 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Baker to let the dollar go. Someone had to play the stimulative role , and that someone would be the  41United States. 
As a result, the dollar would drop a nd it would not be in the interest  of the other central banks to 
defend it. I was absolutely convinced that  was the only thing that Baker could do. 
You realized all this late Friday. Was it t oo late to take acti on in the markets? 
Yes, and it was a very tense weekend because I r ealized that the dollar might open sharply lower. I

Chunk 2897 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
waited for the Far East markets to open Sunday night. 
Do you do a lot of your trading outside of U.S. hours? 
Yes. First, I have monitors everywhere I go—in my home, in my country home. Second, I have a 
staff on duty twenty-four hours a day. 
Is your staff instructed to alert you imme diately in case something big happens? 
Absolutely. First of all, we have call levels in every currency. If a currency breaks out of a range

Chunk 2898 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that we have previously identified, my  staff is under instructions to call. 
How often do you get calls in  the middle of the night? 
I have an assistant trader, and the joke is that he is allowed to wake me up at home twice a year. 
But it really isn't necessary ve ry often. Whenever the markets ar e busy, I know what is going on all 
the time. My home is fully equipped with trading m onitors and direct lines. Also, my assistant's job

Chunk 2899 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
is to be up and get the calls . He probably gets called th ree or four times a night. 
Are you saying that you delegate the nighttime decision making? 
We create a scenario for every cu rrency at least once a week. We de fine the ranges we expect for 
each currency and what we will do if it breaks out of these ranges. 
So your assistant knows that if  currency X gets to 135 He sh ould buy it or sell it?

Chunk 2900 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Those decisions have been made beforehand. But they  are under instruction to  call me if the Prime 
Minister resigns, or if there is a major unexpected  currency revaluation, or something else happens 
to invalidate the recent scenario. 
Are there times you end up trading at night? 
Yes, a lot. 
You obviously can't trade round the clock. How do you structure your time to balance your 
work versus your personal life?

Chunk 2901 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
work versus your personal life? 
I generally try to keep my trading confined between  8 A.M. and 6 or 7 P.M. The Far East is very 
important, and if the currency markets are very ac tive, I will trade the Far East, which opens at 8 
P.M. The A.M. session in Tokyo trades until 12 P.M.  If the markets are in a period of tremendous 
movement, I will go to bed for a couple of hours a nd get up to catch the next  market opening. It is 
tremendously interesting and exciting.

Chunk 2902 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
tremendously interesting and exciting. 
To see the wave roll from country to country? 
Absolutely. When you are really involved, the sc reen almost reaches ou t and grabs you. The way 
the quotes are made changes: They get wider; they get wilder. I have  contacts all over  the world in 
each of these markets and I know what is going on. It is a tremendously exciting game. There are 
opportunities all the time. Forgetting trading for a minute, one of the r easons I am in this business is

Chunk 2903 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that I find the analysis of worl dwide political and economic even ts extraordinarily fascinating. 
The way you describe it, you make the whole pr ocess sound like a constant game, rather than 
work. Do you really look at it that way? 
It doesn't feel like work, except when you lose—the n it feels like work [he laughs]. For me, market 
analysis is like a tremendous multidimensional chess board. The pleasure of it is purely intellectual.

Chunk 2904 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
For example, it is trying to figure out the problems  the finance minister of  New Zealand faces and 
how he may try to solve them. A lo t of people will think that sounds ridiculously exotic. But to me, 
it isn't exotic at all. Here is a guy running this tiny country and he ha s a real set of problems. He has 
to figure how to cope with Australia, the U.S., and the labor unions that are driving him crazy. My

Chunk 2905 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
job is to do the puzzle with him and figure out  what he is going to decide, and what the 
consequences of his actions will be that he or the market doesn't antic ipate. That to me, in itself, is 
tremendous fun.  42In following all these varied world markets,  I know you read a tremendous amount of 
economic literature. Do you also pay any attent ion to the various market advisory letters? 
I get a "guru report" every day.  
Who is on that list?

Chunk 2906 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Who is on that list? 
All the newsletter writers who ha ve a large following. People like Prech-ter, Zweig, Davis, Eliades, 
and so on. 
Do you use your guru report as a measure of contrary opinion? 
I try not to be too much of a wise guy because dur ing major price moves, they will be right for a 
portion of it. What I am r eally looking for is a consensus that th e market is not confirming. I like to 
know that there are a lot of people who are going to be wrong.

Chunk 2907 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
So if you see that most of the members on your guru list are bullish at a time when the market 
is not moving up, and you have some fundamental  reason to be bearish, you will feel stronger 
about the trade? 
Yes, much stronger. 
Do you think people can trade profit ably by just following the gurus? 
Probably, but my impression is that to make m oney, you have to hold a pos ition with conviction. 
That is very difficult when you are following someone else. There are some good gurus, however.

Chunk 2908 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
For example, in the stock market, I like Marty Zw eig. He uses excellent risk control. Unlike some 
other gurus, he doesn't believe he is predicting the future; he is si mply observing what is happening 
and making rational bets. 
You talk about both the importance of risk cont rol and the necessity of having the conviction 
to hold a position. How much risk do you typically take on a trade? 
First of all, I try very hard not to risk more than 1 percent of my portfolio on any single trade.

Chunk 2909 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Second, I study the correlation of my trades to reduce my exposure. We do a daily computer 
analysis to see how correlated our positions are. Through bitter experience, I have learned that a 
mistake in position correlation is the root of some  of the most serious problems in trading. If you 
have eight highly correlate d positions, then you are really trading one position that is eight times as 
large.

Chunk 2910 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
large. 
Does that mean if you are bullish in both the De utsche mark and Swiss fr anc, then you decide 
which one you like better and place your en tire long position in that currency? 
Yes, that is definitely true. But even more impo rtant is the idea of trading a long in one market 
against a short in a related market. For example, right now, although I am net short the dollar, I am 
long the yen and short the Deutsche  mark. In all my trading, if I am long something, I like to be

Chunk 2911 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
short something else. 
Do the cross rates like the Deutsche mark/Jap anese yen move slower than the individual 
currencies themselves? 
Not necessarily. For example, rece ntly the sterling/mark cross ra te was in a yearlong congestion 
between approximately 2.96 and 3.00. It finally br oke out about a month ago. The day it broke out, 
it challenged the top of the range  about twenty times. The Bank of  England kept on defending it.

Chunk 2912 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Finally the Bank of England gave in . As soon as the cross rate pier ced the 3.01 level, there were no 
trades. In fact, there were no trades until it hit 3.0350. So it moved virtually a full 1 percent without 
trading. 
Is that unusual for the interbank market? 
Very unusual. It meant everybody was watching the 3.00 level. Once everyone realized the Bank of 
England was not stepping in, no one wanted to be a seller.

Chunk 2913 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Is that type of breakout—a violent and quick  one—much more reliable than a typical 
breakout? 
Yes, it is much more reliable.  
Even though your fills are worse? 
Terrible fills. The worse the fills ar e, the better your trade. In that  case, after trading for a couple of  43hours between 3.04 and 3.02, the rate went straight up to 3.11. 
Do you believe that the cross rates provide bett er trading opportunities in currencies than net 
short or long positions against the dollar?

Chunk 2914 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
short or long positions against the dollar? 
Yes, because there are a lot fewer people paying atte ntion to the cross rates. The general rule is: 
The less observed, the better the trade. 
Your trading style involves a synthesis of fundame ntal and technical analysis. But if I were to 
say to you, Bruce, we are going to put you in a room and you can have either all the 
fundamental information you want, or all the ch arts and technical input you want, but only 
one, which would you choose?

Chunk 2915 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
one, which would you choose? 
That is like asking a doctor whet her he would prefer treating a patie nt with diagnostics or with a 
chart monitoring his condition. You need both. Bu t, if anything, the fundamentals are more 
important now. In the 1970s, it was a lot easier to make money using techni cal analysis alone. 
There were far fewer false brea kouts. Nowadays, everybody is a chartist, and there are a huge

Chunk 2916 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
number of technical trading system s. I think that change has made it much harder for the technical 
trader. 
Do you think that the trend-following system approach will eventually  self-destruct under the 
weight of its own size and the fact that most  of these systems are using similar approaches? 
I think that is true. The only thing that will save those technical systems is a period of high 
inflation, when simple trend-following methodol ogies will work again. Ho wever, there is no

Chunk 2917 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
question in my mind that if we  have stable, moderate rates of  inflation, the technical trading 
systems will kill each other off. 
Let's shift our conversation to the stock market. Do you believe that th e stock market behaves 
differently from other ma rkets, and if so, how? 
The stock market has far more short-term counter trends. After the market has gone up, it always 
wants to come down. The commodity markets аre driven by supply and demand for physical goods;

Chunk 2918 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
if there is a true shortage, prices  will tend to keep trending higher. 
So if the stock index market is much choppier, are there any technical approaches that can 
work? 
Perhaps, but they keep changing. I have found that  very long-term decision-making systems will 
catch the bigger stock market advances , but you need to use very wide stops. 
So you have to be very long term to filter out the noise. 
Much longer than most traders can handle b ecause that strategy involves riding out large

Chunk 2919 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
retracements. As an alternative approach, one of  the traders I know does very well in the stock 
index markets by trying to figure out how the stock market can hurt the most traders. It seems to 
work for him. 
How can he quantify that? 
He looks at market sentiment numbers, but basically it is a matter of gut feel. 
Some critics have attributed the October 19 87 crash to program trading. What are your own 
feelings?

Chunk 2920 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
feelings? 
I think two different elements we re involved. First, overly high prices le ft the stock market 
vulnerable to a decline, which wa s triggered by rising interest rate s and other fundamental causes. 
Second, that decline was accentuated by heavy sell ing from pension funds who were involved in 
so-called portfolio insurance. 
Are we talking about portfolio insurance as opposed to arbitrage-type program trading!

Chunk 2921 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
[Portfolio insurance involves systematically sellin g stock index futures as stock prices decline 
(and covering those shorts when prices rise) in order to reduce portfolio risk. Program trading 
normally refers to buying and selling stock index futures against an opposite position in a basket of 
stocks when the prices of the two are out of line.]  
Right. The only way in which arbitrage could be sa id to have contributed to the problem, rather

Chunk 2922 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
than helped it, is that if it weren’t for program trading arbitrage, portfolio  insurance may never have  44been developed. 
So the arbitrageurs are only to be blamed fo r the market decline insofar as they made 
portfolio insurance possible? 
Yes. If you read the Brady report, you will see that the portfolio insurers cam e into the market with 
billions of dollars wort h of sales in a few hours. The market was unable to abso rb it. Portfolio

Chunk 2923 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
insurance was a terrible idea; it was insurance in  name only. In fact, it was nothing more than a 
massive stop-loss order. If it were not for portfolio  insurance selli ng, the market would still have 
gone down sharply, but nothing like the 500-point decline we witnessed. 
Do you feel great traders have a special talent? 
In a sense. By definition, there can only be a re latively small group of superior traders, since 
trading is a zero-sum game.

Chunk 2924 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trading is a zero-sum game. 
What is the balance of trading suc cess between talent and hard work? 
If you don't work very hard, it is extremely unlikely that you will be a good trader. 
Are there some traders who can just coast by on innate skills? 
You can do that for a while. There are a lot of one-year w onders in trading. It is quite common to 
find somebody who has a strong feeli ng that sugar is going to 40 cen ts, or that the copper spreads

Chunk 2925 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
are going to widen dramatically, a nd that one idea turns out right. For example, recently I heard 
about a trader who made $27 million trading copper sp reads this past year, and then lost virtually 
all of it. 
What advice would you give the novice trader? 
First, I would say that risk management is the most important thing to be well understood. 
Undertrade, undertrade, undertrade is my second piece of advice. Whatever you think your position

Chunk 2926 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
ought to be, cut it at least in half. My experience w ith novice traders is that they trade three to five 
times too big. They are taking 5 to  10 percent risks on a trade when  they should be taking 1 to 2 
percent risks. 
Besides overtrading, what other mistak es do novice traders typically make? 
They personalize the market. A common mistake is to think of the market as a personal nemesis. 
The market, of course, is totally impersonal; it doesn't care whether you make money or not.

Chunk 2927 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Whenever a trader says, "I wish," or "I hope," he is engaging in a destructive way of thinking 
because it takes attention away from the diagnostic process. 
In my conversation with Kovner, I was struck  by the immense complexity and scope of his 
analysis. I still can't fi gure out how he can find the time to follow and analyz e intricately the 
economies of so many different count ries, let alone integrate these va rious analyses into a single

Chunk 2928 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
picture. Clearly, Kovner's unique synthesis of worldwide fundament al and technical analysis is 
hardly translatable to the averag e trader. Nevertheless, there are key elements in Kovner's trading 
approach that have direct releva nce to the more mundane trader. 
Kovner lists risk management as the key to successf ul trading; he always decides on an exit point 
before he puts on a trade. He also stresses the need for evaluating risk on a portfolio basis rather

Chunk 2929 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
than viewing the risk of each trade independentl y. This is absolutely critical when one holds 
positions that are highly correlated, since the overall portfolio risk is likely to be much greater than 
the trader realizes. 
One statement by Kovner, which made a partic ularly strong impression on me, concerned his 
approach in placing stops: "I place my stop at a point that is too fa r away or too difficult to reach

Chunk 2930 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
easily." In this manner, Kovner maximizes the chan ces that he will not be stopped out of a trade 
that proves correct, while at th e same time maintaining rigid m oney management discipline. The 
philosophy behind this approach is that it is bett er to allocate the predetermined maximum dollar 
risk in a trade to a smaller numbe r of contracts, while using a wide r stop. This is the exact reverse

Chunk 2931 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
of the typical trader, who will try to limit the lo ss per contract, but trade as many contracts as 
possible—an approach which usually results in  many good trades being stopped out before the 
market moves in the anticipated direction. The moral is: Place your stops at al point that, if reached, 
will reasonably indicate that the trade is wro ng,' not at a point determined primarily by the  45maximum dollar amount you are willing to lose per c ontract. If the meaningful stop point implies

Chunk 2932 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
an uncomfortably large loss per contract , trade a smaller number of contracts. 
Kovner's worst trading mistake—his "going bust trade, " as he terms it—resulted from a spur of the 
moment decision. My own personal experience underscores that there is probably no class of trades 
with a higher failure rate than impulsive (not to be confused with intuitive) trades. Regardless of 
the approach used, once a strategy  is selected, the trader should st ick to his or her game plan and

Chunk 2933 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
avoid impulsive trading decisions (for example,  putting on an unplanned trade because a friend has 
just recommended it; liquidating a position before th e predetermined stop point is reached because 
of an adverse price movement). 
Finally, Kovner views a good trader as "strong, independent, and co ntrary in the extreme," and 
points to discipline and a willingness to make (a nd accept) mistakes as significant traits of the 
winning trader.

46Richard Dennis-A Legend Retires 
Richard Dennis became intrigued by commodity trading during the late 1960s, while earning the 
minimum wage as a runner on the exchange floor.  In the summer of 1970, he decided to take a 
crack at trading on his own, and with $1,600 borrowed from his family, he purchased a seat on the 
Mid America Exchange.

Chunk 2935 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Mid America Exchange. 
The Mid Am, as it is called, is a kind of minor league exchange because it trades pint-sized 
versions of the contracts traded on the major exch anges. The Mid Am tends to attract the business 
of small hedgers and speculators for whom a single regu lar-sized contract represents too large a 
position. As a fledgling trader with little risk ca pital, the Mid Am was well suited to Dennis—it 
was also the only exchange on which he could afford a seat.

Chunk 2936 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The seat cost Dennis $1,200, leaving him a scant $400 for trading. Incredible as it may seem, he 
eventually transformed that tiny stake into a fortune, which has been estimated by some to 
approach $200 million. As his father is reported to  have said, in what must be one of the grand 
understatements of all time, "Let's just say Ri chie ran that four hundred bucks up pretty good." 
Although Dennis has been exceptionally successful  over the long haul, he has withstood a few

Chunk 2937 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
dramatic setbacks. He was in the midst of one su ch downturn at the time of  our interview. Several 
of the public funds managed by Dennis lost e nough during the late 1987- early 1988 period to 
trigger the 50 percent loss cuto ff point for the cessation of tr ading. Dennis' personal account 
witnessed a similar fate. As he expressed in a le tter to investors, "These results parallel immense 
losses in my own personal trading."

Chunk 2938 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
losses in my own personal trading." 
Perhaps one of Dennis' most impressi ve traits as a trader is his ability to weather such hard times 
with little emotional impact. Apparently, he has l earned to accept such sporad ic large losses as part 
of the game. His confidence during such periods  remains unshaken, as he believes he will 
eventually rebound if he stays tr ue to his basic trading stra tegy. Had I not known, judging by the

Chunk 2939 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
mood and confidence of the man I in terviewed, I would sooner have gu essed that he had just made 
a small fortune rather than lost one. 
Whatever the stereotype image of a centimillionaire may be, Dennis does not fit it. His low-
spending lifestyle is legendary. In fact, his only real extravagances are his sizable political and 
charitable contributions. His political views also do not mesh with the popular image of the very

Chunk 2940 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
rich. Dennis is the founder of the Roosevelt Cent er for American Policy Studies, a liberal think 
tank, and he supports the concept of higher tax rates for wealthy Americans. In recent years, he has 
taken an increasingly active role in the political sphere, supporting a variet y of liberal candidates. 
Unlike trading, his win-loss ratio in politics has b een disappointing. In the 1988 presidential race, 
Dennis was the national cochairman for the Babbitt campaign.

Chunk 2941 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
In drawing up a list of candidates to be interviewed for this project, Dennis was an essential name. 
He is one of the foremost trading legends of our time—a trader that a number of others interviewed 
in this book cited with the phras e, "I'm not in his league." 
In setting up the interview, I dealt with one of Dennis' assistants. After e xplaining the project to 
him, he told me he would talk to  Dennis and get back to me. About one  week later, I received a call

Chunk 2942 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
informing me that Dennis could see me on a date  about one month forwar d for exactly one hour. I 
explained that I was coming to Chicago for the primary purpose of interv iewing Dennis and that 
one hour was hardly enough time to cover all the essentia l areas. The response e ssentially was: that 
was all the time allotted; the implicit message: Take  it or leave it. I agr eed, hoping that I would get 
some more time if the interview was going well.

Chunk 2943 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
some more time if the interview was going well. 
I arrived about five minutes before the appointed  time and was ushered into a large but decidedly 
unpretentious office. Dennis arrive d precisely on the hour, shook ha nds politely, and sat down at 
his desk. He apologized in advance if, in the course  of the interview, he occasionally glanced at the 
quote screen, explaining that he c ould keep his mind on the intervie w at the same time, and would

Chunk 2944 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
signal me if he had to put in any orders. Having the experience of trading myself (albeit on an in-
fmitesimally smaller scale), I explained that I understood. 
As the interview began, there was an element of uneas e on both our parts. In my case, I had a sense 
of a ticking clock with not enough time to accomplish the task at ha nd. In the case of Dennis, I

Chunk 2945 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
believe it was a matter of a genuinely shy personalit y, at least in terms of a first meeting. After five  47to ten minutes, the tension was gone, the atmosphere became relaxed, and the conversation flowed 
smoothly. 
Forty-five minutes into the interview, I began to  think that things were going so well that Dennis 
would continue our conversation beyond the allotted hou r. At exactly ten minutes before the end of

Chunk 2946 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the hour, my illusion was shattered. "I've only got a bout ten more minutes," he said, "so if there's 
still stuff that's important you may want to get to  it." I shuffled through my index cards and quickly 
tried to identify some of the key questions I had not yet covered. Precisely at the end of the hour, 
Dennis said, "That's about all the time I have, thank you." 
One segment of questions I did not get to dealt with  the political side of Dennis' experiences. These

Chunk 2947 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
topics included the Senate hear ings on alleged manipulation of th e soybean market by Dennis, the 
Roosevelt Institute, and the various political figures Dennis had known. Although these subjects 
were certainly areas of interest and color, they we re not pertinent to the primary focus of this book. 
Consequently, I chose questions rela ted to trading before attempting to turn to anything politically 
oriented.

Chunk 2948 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
oriented. 
At the end of the interview, I played my final ca rd by saying, "I didn't ev en get to any questions 
related to the political side." "They're not interest ed in that anyway," Denni s replied as he politely 
said goodbye and left the office. 
About six weeks later, I requested and obtained a follow-up interview with Dennis. The portion of 
the interview dealing w ith the budget deficit problem and Denni s' large losses in his public fund

Chunk 2949 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trading at that time came  from this second meeting. 
A month after our last conversation, Dennis a nnounced that he was re tiring from trading to 
concentrate on his political intere sts full-time. Will Dennis never trade again? Maybe, but don't bet 
on it. 
How did you first get invol ved in commodity trading? 
After graduating high school, I got a summer job as a runner on the floor and I dabbled in trading a

Chunk 2950 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
little bit. With my minimum-wage salary, I was making $40 a week, and losing $40 an hour 
trading. I didn't know what I was do ing. The advantage was that at least I got to do it with small 
amounts of money. I like to say the tuition was small for what I learned. 
I heard the story that before you turned twen ty-one, you had your father stand in the ring, 
while you stood on the sidelines signaling trades to him.

Chunk 2951 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
That was in 1968 and 1969. My father had the memb ership but he didn't know much about trading. 
He was just going along with it beca use I was underage and wanted to  do it. When I turned twenty-
one, it was one of the happiest days in his life because  he said, "I really ha te this. I have no idea 
what I'm doing. It's yours!" 
Were you at a disadvantage trading one step  removed, with your father filling the orders? 
Sure. We consistently lost.

Chunk 2952 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Sure. We consistently lost. 
But you couldn't have lost very much because you were trading very small. 
I probably lost a couple of thous and dollars durin g that period. 
Do you consider that period worthwhile, nonetheless, because of the lessons learned? 
Yes, in retrospect, I wo uld say this to new traders—although  it may not be a reassuring thought—
when you start, you ought to be as bad a trader as you are ever going to be. 
Because it is less expensive at that time?

Chunk 2953 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Because it is less expensive at that time? 
Right. You shouldn't be too surprised if you really screw up. 
Do you know traders for whom early success proved to be their undoing? 
I have noticed variations of that. There are a lo t of people who get imprin ted like ducks. You can 
teach them that a warship is their mother if you get them young enough. For a lot of traders, it 
doesn't matter so much whether their first big trade is successful or not, but  whether their first big

Chunk 2954 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
profit is on the long or short side. Those people tend to  be perennial bulls or bears, and that is very 
bad. Both sides have to be equa lly OK. There can't be anything psychologically more satisfying 
about one than the other. If there is , your trading is going to go askew. 
I think that's what happened to a lot of people in  the 1973 runaway bull market in soybeans. Even if  48they didn't make money themselves, but were just  present to witness the market mania and see a

Chunk 2955 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
few people make a lot of money, they were imprinted with it. 
You're talking about a subsequent bias to th e bullish side because of that experience? 
Yes. 
What gave you confidence when you first starte d trading on the Mid America Exchange with 
such a small stake? After all, one mistake and you were out of the game. 
Well,  no,  the advantage of the Mid America Excha nge was that they traded minicontracts. I had a

Chunk 2956 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
few mistakes in me, and I made most, but not all of them. I don't know that  I had any confidence. I 
just had what a lot of people have when they get in  this business: a need to try to succeed. I mean, if 
you were betting on this sort of thing before th e fact, you should have bet that it wouldn't work. 
There is no doubt about that. 
Most traders are not successful in the fi rst year. What were you doing differently?

Chunk 2957 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I was doing enough things ri ght that I didn't capsize even with that small cap italization. I was lucky 
enough to stagger into having the right positi ons on before the big corn blight in 1970. 
Was that luck or foresight? 
I think it was more foresight. I had very pale ideas,  rales, and attitudes about the market then. But a 
few that I learned were ri ght, like go with the trend. 
One Friday, the grain markets all closed at their highs for the year. I believed—and I still believe—

Chunk 2958 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that you go with the trend, and the stronger the tre nd, the better. I remember getting in on the close 
and just buying a couple of mi nicontracts in corn, wheat, and beans. The next Monday morning 
they all opened up the limit because of the corn blight news. 
Sure that didn't have to happen, and if it didn't, it would have set me back. It might have taken a lot 
longer to get to about $2,000, which compared to $400 was a real grubstake. But, it wasn't like I

Chunk 2959 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
threw a dart and decided what to do. I did something that should wo rk in the long ran—I went with 
the trend. 
Is this particular pattern— a very strong close on a Friday—a market  characteristic that you find 
useful as an indicator of th e following week's price action?  
Yes, at a minimum, it is important not to have a short position with a loss on Friday if the market 
closes at a high, or a long position if it closes at alow.

Chunk 2960 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I was curious about your going to graduate sc hool despite your initial trading success. 
I signed up for graduate school before the summer of 1970, which was when I traded in the pit for 
the first time. I had just pla nned to trade over the summer, but  the three months and $3,000 in 
profits made a big impression on me. I went to Tu lane in New Orleans a nd lasted for about one 
week. I used my laundromat quarters phoning trades  into Chicago. Once I used up all the quarters

Chunk 2961 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
and had nothing but dirty clothes, I had no choice but to come back to Chicago. 
Since then you have been a full-time commodity trader? 
Yes. 
What comes to mind as your most dramatic  or most emotional trading experience? 
There was one in the first year . I had just quit graduate school to trade. One day, I made a 
particularly bad trade and lost  about $300. Since I only had about $3,000, that was a very big loss

Chunk 2962 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
and it was destabilizing.  I then compounded the error by revers ing my original position and losing 
again. To top things off, I then reversed back to  my original position and lo st a third time. By the 
end of the day, I had lost $1,000, or one -third of my entire capitalization. 
Since then, I have learned that wh en you have a destabilizi ng loss, get out, go home, take a nap, do 
something, but put a little time be tween that and your next decisi on. When you are getting beat to

Chunk 2963 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
death, get your head out of the mi xer. Looking back, I realized that if I had had a trading rale about 
losses, I wouldn't have had that traumatic experience. 
In retrospect, would you say that was one of your best trades because you were so imprinted 
with that experience that you didn't make a mistake of that magnitude, percentagewise, 
again?  49Absolutely. I learned to avoid tryi ng to catch up or double up to rec oup losses. I also learned that a

Chunk 2964 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
certain amount of loss will affect your judgment, so you have to put some time between that loss 
and the next trade. 
I guess a corollary of that would be: When things  aren't going right, don't push, don't press. 
Yes. After all is said and done, you have to minimize your losse s and try to pres erve capital for 
those few instances when you can make a lot in a ve ry short period of time. What you can't afford

Chunk 2965 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to do is throw away your capital on  suboptimal trades. If you do, you w ill be too debil itated to trade 
when the right position comes along. Even if you put the trade on, it will be relatively small 
because your capital will have been depleted by the other trades. 
Was the 1973 soybean market your first really big market? 
I made enough money in that market to go to the Chicago Board of Trade the next year. I didn't

Chunk 2966 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
make my money by just going long soybeans. I was ba sically a pit trader, who traded in and out a 
lot. The markets were very good, because there was ex cellent order flow. It wa s a great time to be 
in the pit. 
So it wasn't so much catching the trend. It was more a matter of scalping the market 
successfully. 
Also, so many people would make incredibly bad trad es just to take a profit. They would get out

Chunk 2967 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
even though the market was locked limit-up and almost sure to go up the next day. They couldn't 
stand the profits burning a hole in their pocket. I would try to get in when they were getting out. 
It sounds like easy pickings. 
There was some amount of risk, but  if you were disposed to going w ith a strong trend, it was a deal. 
They were giving you an edge to do it. 
Giving you a high probability that th e next day you would be ahead?

Chunk 2968 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
You have to remember some of these markets we nt up the limit ten days in a row. Most people 
thought that even four or five cons ecutive limit-up days was impossible. 
In situations where a market goes limit-up, limit-up, limit-up, at  some point, the market may 
open limit-down. How do you recognize or sense when not to buy at limit bid? 
It's just an odds play. There is  a lot of volatility in  the outcome, but you know the odds are in your 
favor when you go long at limit bid.

Chunk 2969 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
favor when you go long at limit bid. 
In all the years you have traded, have th ere been any really bad years? Was there a 
particular market or two that you were dead wrong about and that caused it to be a bad 
year? 
When we have had bad trading periods, it is really not one market that does it. In those situations, 
almost all the markets are going si deways and making lots of false breakouts. If one of the markets 
is decent, that is usually enough to avoid a bad situation.

Chunk 2970 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Is there any year that stands out? 
1978 was not a good year for trading. I compounded losses unnecessarily b ecause I was in the 
process of making the transition from floor trader to off-the-floor trader and had no idea how 
different they were. 
Was 1978 the year that you started trading from an office? 
In 1977,1 was mostly a floor trader, and by 1978 I had made the full-time transition. 
Did that switch cause you to become more of a long-term position trader?

Chunk 2971 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Ultimately, what I learned from 1978 is that you have to be longer term as a desk trader. In the pit, 
if it looked like soybeans were going to break 3 cents, I would sell, and if it didn't break, I would 
get out. You don't have that luxury off the floor, because you lose the edge when putting in the 
orders. Also, the judgments you make  looking at prices on the screen aren't as good as those made

Chunk 2972 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
in the pit watching what is goi ng on. In the pit, there are indi cators that you learn subconsciously, 
like "these three guys are never right at market turns," and if they al l do the same thing at the same 
time, a light clicks on. It took me a long time to realize th at those tools were n't going to be 
available anymore.  50Why did you make the change? You were doing really well on the floor. Why switch to a 
desk?

Chunk 2973 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
desk? 
When I started in 1970, there were  no futures markets in currencies,  interest rates, or gold. By 
1978, these markets had been listed on the board long enough to be viable. The currencies started in 
1974, but it took several years to get enough volume. 
So, it was the desire to trade more markets than you physically could in a single location that 
motivated your move? 
And the opportunity didn't exist five years earlier.

Chunk 2974 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I understand that you initiated a trader -trainee program. What year was that? 
We hired a group at the be ginning of 1984 and another group at the beginning of 1985. 
What was the motivation for this program? 
I have a partner who has been a friend since hi gh school. We have had ph ilosophical disagreements 
about everything you could imagine.  One of these arguments was wh ether the skills of a successful

Chunk 2975 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trader could be reduced to a set of rules—th at was my point of view—or whether there was 
something ineffable, mystical, subjective, or intuitive that made someone a good trader. This 
argument had been going on for a long time, and I guess  I was getting a little frustrated with idle 
speculation. Finall y, I said, "Here is a way we can definitely  resolve this argument. Let's hire and 
train some people and see what happens." He agreed.

Chunk 2976 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
It was an intellectual experiment. We trained them as well as we could. That was the way to do the 
experiment right, I thought. I tried to codify al l the things I knew about the markets. We taught 
them a little bit about probability, money management , and trading. It turned out I was right. I don't 
say that to pat myself on the back, but even I am surprised how well it worked. It's frightening how 
well it worked.

Chunk 2977 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
well it worked. 
Is your basic contention that you can take almo st any reasonably inte lligent individual and 
turn him into a successful trader? 
No. We screened for people we thought would be right. We received 1,000 applications and 
narrowed it down to forty people whom we interviewed. Then we picked ten. 
What qualities were you looking for? 
I don't like to discuss that because if I told you one of the things we looked for was chess players,

Chunk 2978 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
and we ever do it again, we would be i nundated by resumes from chess players. 
Was intelligence one of the key items? 
It was one of the traits, but it wa sn't the essential item. To find the things that we were looking for, 
we could choose from intelligent or extremely inte lligent people. We picked the ones with extreme 
intelligence just because they were available. 
Didn't you have any reluctance about giving away trade secrets?

Chunk 2979 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Sure, but I don't think trading st rategies are as vulnerable to not working if people know about 
them, as most traders believe. If what you are doi ng is right, it will work even if people have a 
general idea about it. I always say that you could publish trading rules in the newspaper and no one 
would follow them. The key is consistency and di scipline. Almost anybody can make up a list of 
rules that are 80 percent as good as what we taught our people. What  they couldn't do is give them

Chunk 2980 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the confidence to stick to those rale s even when things are going bad. 
How long was the training process? 
Shockingly short. In the first year , it took two weeks. Then we had them trade for a month and keep 
a log indicating why they made their trades. We want ed to see if they were consistent in doing what 
they had been taught. We really got good at it in  the second year—the cour se took just one week. 
How many trainees were there? 
Twenty-three in total.  
What were the results?

Chunk 2981 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Twenty-three in total.  
What were the results? 
We dropped three people who didn' t do well. The other tw enty, however, have averaged about 100 
percent profit per year.  51When you train people, you tell them your basic approach to the markets. Isn't there a risk of 
creating twenty clones of Richard Dennis? Wouldn' t their trading results be highly correlated 
with what you are doing? 
There was a huge spread. One of the things that we  repeatedly told the class was: "We are going to

Chunk 2982 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
teach you what we think works, but you are expect ed to add your own pers onal flair, feeling, or 
judgment." 
How large are the stakes these traders are using? 
It has increased over the years as they have ma de money. I would say on average about $2 million 
each. 
What did they start out with? 
One hundred thousand dollars each. 
I've heard this group of trad ers referred to as the "turtles ." I found that term somewhat 
amusing. What is the origin of the name?

Chunk 2983 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
amusing. What is the origin of the name? 
When I decided to do the trader-tra inee program, I had just returned fr om a trip to the Far East. In 
telling someone about the program I said, "We are goi ng to grow traders just like they grow turtles 
in Singapore." I had visited a farm there and seen a huge vat with thousands of squirming turtles; 
that became my image of growing traders. 
How much of a role does luck play in trading?

Chunk 2984 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How much of a role does luck play in trading? 
In the long run, zero. Absolutely zero. I don't think anybody winds up making money in this 
business because they started out lucky. 
But on individual trades, obvi ously, it makes a difference? 
That is where the confusion lies. On any individual trade it is almost all luck. It is just a matter of 
statistics. If you take something that has a 53 pe rcent chance of working each time, over the long

Chunk 2985 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
run there is a 100 percent chance of it working. If I review the results of two different traders, 
looking at anything less than one year  doesn't make any sense. It might be a couple of years before 
you can determine if one is better than the other. 
You are one of the few people who is both a discretionary trader and a systems trader. How 
would you compare the two approaches? 
Professional traders may do some ve ry intelligent things, but they  have a tendency not to think

Chunk 2986 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
systematically about what they ar e doing. For example, most trader s who do a trade that works will 
not think: Why did it work? What did I do here that I might be ab le to do in another market, at 
another time? There is not a lot of  reflection on the process of tradi ng, hi contrast, I think I always 
have been analytical about trading, even befo re I ever researched a mechanical system. 
On the opposite extreme, you have the academic types who research before they have ever traded.

Chunk 2987 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
They lack the seat-of-the-pants knowledge necessar y to develop good trading systems. Mercifully, I 
did the trading first. Therefore, the research we do is more applicable to the real world. 
Can you give me an example of how the la ck of real world experience would hurt the 
researcher? 
As an example, assume I develop a mechanical sy stem that often signals placement of stops at 
points where I know there will tend to be a lot of stops , hi the real world, it is not too wise to have

Chunk 2988 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
your stop where everyone else ha s their stop. Also, that system is going to have above-average 
skids. If you don't understand that a nd adjust the results ac cordingly, you are go ing to get a system 
that looks great on paper, but  is going to do consistently  poorer in the real world. 
You mentioned that before you developed a m echanical trading system, you paid close 
attention to the trading process. Did you keep a log of what you did righ t and wrong, or was it 
a matter of memory?

Chunk 2989 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
a matter of memory? 
Yes, I would write down observations and thin k about them. I thought about everything I was 
doing. 
Is that something you would advise other traders to do to improve— that is, keep track of 
what they are doing right and what they are doing wrong?  52Sure. The trading experience is so intense that there is a natural tendency to want to avoid thinking 
about it once the day is ove r. I am that way when things are wo rking. But, when they are not, it

Chunk 2990 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
spurs me to want to think about what I'm doing  and how I might do better.  When things go bad, 
traders shouldn't stick th eir heads in the sand and just hope it gets better. 
What you are saying is that the times when it is most tempting to a void thinking about the 
markets at all are the times when you sh ould be thinking about them the most. 
Right. I don't have any problem with that be cause I am obsessive about the markets.

Chunk 2991 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
What do you do in a situation where your feelin gs as a trader tell you to do one thing and 
your systems point in the other direction? 
If they are absolutely opposed, you do not hing until you can resolve that conflict. 
Are most of your systems trend oriented in nature? 
Yes. 
So, by definition, they will nev er be in the right direction at market turns. Yet you, as an 
experienced trader, may sense when a market m ay be prone for a turn. In a situation like

Chunk 2992 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that, would you be willing to buy because of what you see as a trader even though your 
system is short? 
I would probably want to be flat, since I tend to  weigh the psychological, opinion-oriented segment 
of trading about equal with the t echnical and trend-following element. 
So you want to see the market display some  signs of turning around before you'll commit? 
What is more likely is that I will be positioned in the right di rection of a trend and decide to

Chunk 2993 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
liquidate faster than a trend-following syst em would because of the intuitive factor. 
What about entering a new trade counter to a prevailing trend? 
I've certainly done it—that is, made countertrend in itiations. However, as a rule of thumb, I don't 
think you should do it. 
Do those type of trades do more poorly than other trades? 
Generally, yes, although every now and then they may give you a great stor y like going short sugar

Chunk 2994 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
at 60 cents, which I did. [Sugar plummeted from a high of 66 cents in N ovember 1974 to a relative 
low under 12 cents only seven months later. E ach 1 -cent move in sugar is worth $ 1,120 per 
contract. A large trader like Denni s will often trade positions measur ed in thousands of contracts.] 
I've got ten stories like that. But I have to tell you, in all honesty, I don't think the broad class of 
trades I have done like that  have been profitable.

Chunk 2995 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The short sugar trade is a great example beca use the market had witnessed an incredibly 
explosive upmove and it took a lo t of courage to step in as a se ller at 60 cents. But take the flip 
side when sugar is in a real bear market and is  down to 5 cents; every trend-following system 
in the world is going to be short. Yet, if conditions are such that the fundamentals are in 
transition and the market price is only a little over the cost of the bag it's packed in, would

Chunk 2996 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
you make an exception? 
Actually, I've lost more money in situations like that because all the market has to do is go down 
one more cent and you are out of there. I made a lot of money going short sugar at 60 cents, but I 
lost much more going long sugar at 6 cents. 
When you do a trade like that , that is, buying a market because the downside is so-called 
"limited," do you just ride it out, or  do you eventually throw in the towel?

Chunk 2997 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
You throw it in. Because how do you know? Maybe it is going to 2 cents; maybe it is going to 1 
cent. 
I guess a main concern is that you are cons tantly giving up the premium in the forward 
months. [In a bear market, the more forward contracts tend to trade at a premium. For 
example, May sugar might be  at 6 cents, July at 6\ and October at 7. Even if cash prices 
remained stable, a holder of October futures would lose 1 cent between May and October.]

Chunk 2998 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Sure, you are forced out at 3 and get back  in at 5. Then it falls to 3 again.  53Otherwise, there wouldn't be th at much risk in the trade. 
Right. The idea that one side  of the market is much more likely to work in the absence of anything 
else is an illusion. The market ju st wouldn't be there if  that was true. There were plenty of guys 
who went short soybeans at $4 in 1973, because just  like sugar at 4 cents couldn't go any lower,

Chunk 2999 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
beans at $4 couldn't go any higher. Well, not only did they go highe r, they went to  a high of $12.97 
in a matter of four or five months. There is anot her point that I think is  as important: You should 
expect the unexpected in this bus iness; expect the extreme. Don't think in terms of boundaries that 
limit what the market might do. If mere is any lesson I have learned in the n early twenty years that

Chunk 3000 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I've been in this business, it is that the unexp ected and the impossible happen every now and then. 
So don't be too tied to history? 
Right. 
And yet, all your rules are based on history. Is there a contradiction there? 
No, because a good trend-following system will keep you in the market until there is evidence that 
the trend has changed. If you had been doing your  historical research on soybeans in 1972, you

Chunk 3001 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
would have concluded that any time soybeans a dvance by 50 cents, you mi ght as well get out, 
because the market had never moved up or down by significantly more than that. Obviously, that 
was the wrong conclusion because it went up an other $8. A good trend-following system, however, 
would have kept you in for most of the move. 
So you don't want to draw boundaries  from history over market behavior?

Chunk 3002 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Right. The correct approach is to say: This structure means up, and this structure means up no 
more, but never that this structur e means up this much and no more. 
When you trade a system, do you go with the versio n of the system that tested out best for the 
past, or do other factors command consideration? 
One of the toughest problems in deciding how to tr ade is whether you just go with what is optimal

Chunk 3003 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
for the data base, or whether you start from some other premise.  You might deliberately trade 
something other than the optimal parameter set [version of the system w ith the best past per-
formance] because you think the future is going to be unlike the past in a specific way. By 
definition, any other parameter set is going to have a poorer past pe rformance than the optimal set. 
But if the difference in performance is only 10 percent, it might well be worth that 10 percent

Chunk 3004 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
difference if you believe the suboptimal set, as measured by past data, will fit the future better. 
You have gone from being a very small trader to  a very large trader, especially now that you 
are managing outside money. Do you find that or der size gets in the way? Does it become 
substantially more difficult to be successful when you are trading size? 
At some level it would. I don't think we have reached that point yet, although we may not be

Chunk 3005 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
tremendously far away from it. I think about thre e times the amount we are handling now would be 
just about it. We currently have about $120 million in customer funds. 
In other words, you haven't hit the wall yet? 
No. 
Is that because you are using many different a pproaches and, therefore, don't have all your 
orders going in at one point? 
Yes. You have to think about diversification. If you had one method, or one person, making all the

Chunk 3006 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
decisions, you couldn't handle amount s that large. But if you use di fferent strategies and have a 
diversity in decision makers, you can handle se veral hundred million dollars without any major 
problem. 
Could that have been a subliminal reason fo r developing your training program—to try to 
diversify the decision-making process? 
Actually, we hadn't thought of it that  way, but it did work to our adva ntage. In fact, we are going to

Chunk 3007 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
try to market some of the traders we have trained for trading customer money. 
Is slippage a problem in your trading? [Slippage is the difference between the theoretical 
execution price assumed by a computer program and the actual fill price.]  54No. We try to make a hard-nosed estimate when bu ilding the cost of trading into a system. Also, we 
reduce our costs significantly  by having our own brokers. 
When you hold a major position, at what poin t do you know you are wrong? What tells you

Chunk 3008 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to get out of the position? 
If you have a loss on a trade after a week or two, you are clearly wrong. Even when you are around 
breakeven, but a significant amount of time has passed, you are probably wrong mere too. 
Do you define your maximum risk point when you get into a trade? 
You should always have a worst case point. The only choice should be to get out quicker. 
Are you largely a self-taught trader, or did other traders teach you lessons that were 
worthwhile?

Chunk 3009 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
worthwhile? 
I would say I am self-taught. What is really amazi ng is how little published literature there is on 
trading. 
Is there anything you can recommend to people who are interested in trading? 
I think Edwin Lefevre's Reminiscences of a Stock Operator [reputedly a semifictionalized 
biography of Jesse Livermore, the legendary stock trader] is interesting and captures the feel of 
trading pretty well, but that book was written sixty-five years ago.

Chunk 3010 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Are there some key trading strategies that you can talk about without revealing any secrets? 
The market being in a trend is the main thing that eventually gets us in a trade. That is a pretty 
simple idea. Being consistent and making sure you do that all the time is probably more important 
than the particular characterist ics you use to define the trend. Whatever method you use to enter

Chunk 3011 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trades, the most critical th ing is that if there is a major trend,  your approach should  assure that you 
get in that trend. 
A trend could easily be defined using a simple  system. Is there something special that you 
look for to define a trend? 
No. If I see a trend developing, I kn ow eventually I'll have to get in. The question is whether I get 
in earlier or later, and that might  depend on how I see the market r eacting to news. If a market goes

Chunk 3012 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
up when it should go up, I might buy earlier. If it goes down when it should go up, I'll wait until the 
trend is better defined. 
How much common behavior is there between mark ets? Are the patterns of beans similar to 
the patterns of bonds, or do markets have their own personalities? 
I could trade without knowing the name of the market. 
So, what you are saying is that pattern s in different markets are very similar.

Chunk 3013 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yes. In our research, if a system doesn't work  for both bonds and beans, we don't care about it. 
Would you say the stock ma rket is an exception? That is, do es the stock market also behave 
like other markets, or do es the stock market have its own behavior pattern? 
I think it is probably separate.  
Why would you say that is true? 
Well, my research on individual stocks shows that price fluctuations are clos er to random than they

Chunk 3014 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
are in commodities. Demonstrably, commodities are trending and, arguably, stocks are random. 
Do you have an explanation for that phenomenon? 
I believe that there is not enough fundamental info rmation per stock to create sufficient trends to 
move them from their random character. There ar en't as many commodities as there are stocks. 
In other words, there is not the same flow of  information as in the commodity markets?

Chunk 3015 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
There is not enough information, not e nough fundamentals. Just nothing going on. 
In the commodity markets, technical information is basically confined to price, volume, and 
open interest. Since th ere is so much more technical info rmation available for stock indexes—
advance/decline ratios, various sentiment indica tors, relationships between different groups 
of stocks, etc.—do ordinary trend-following sy stems start off at a big disadvantage because  55they don't use enough information?

Chunk 3016 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I'm not sure that is the disadvantag e. I think the disadvantage is that  stock index prices are too close 
to random to develop enough clear-cut trends b ecause the inputs—the individual stocks—are 
mostly random. 
What are your thoughts on the rec ent attacks against program trading? 
The people that are complaining ought  to be ashamed of themselves.  
Do you mean people in the financial community? 
Yes. They should have enough sophistication to  understand the inanity of what they are

Chunk 3017 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
complaining about. 
Do you see program trading as a conven ient scapegoat for a declining market? 
Sure. It is a good excuse for doing a lousy job fo r yourself and your clients. The claim is that 
program traders are taking money out of the pockets  of the people who are investing in the stock 
market. Nothing could be further from the trut h. Program trading may move the stock market 
around a bit, but not in any systematic way. If progr am trading caused prices to go too high or too

Chunk 3018 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
low, that should provide better opportunities for the value investor . Of course, it's bad for those 
people who pretend they are value in vestors, but are really traders. 
How do you handle a losing streak? 
Cut back. If it is really bad, stop and get out. 
Do you sometimes need to get away from the markets for a few days? 
Generally, it just takes a day or two, but you do need to stop for a period of time. It is almost like a

Chunk 3019 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
pitcher not balking. Before he throws the ball, he ha s to stop at least for that second. That is what I 
try to do—at least have a pause.  It could be for just one day. 
What is the biggest public fa llacy about market behavior? 
That markets are supposed to make sense. 
How about fallacies regardi ng technical analysis? 
The belief that technical factors are not as important as the fundamentals. 
Are there any analysts whose work you respect?

Chunk 3020 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Are there any analysts whose work you respect? 
There are a lot of them/Zweig) for example, is good. 
Would you consider the work of outside analysts as an input in a trade? 
No. When we taught our people to trade, I ha d a hypothetical question: Suppose everything you 
know about the markets indicates a "buy." Then you call the floor and they tell you that I'm selling. 
Do you: (a) buy, (b) go short, (c) do nothing? If they didn't even tually understand  that (a) was

Chunk 3021 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
correct because they have to make their own market  decisions, then they di dn't fit into the program. 
Why do you handle other people's money? You are doing very well on your own. 
Well, there is one big advantage: managed money of fers potential return with no risk. For ten years, 
people have been asking me if I'm getting tired of all the risk. Do I think I'm going to bum out? Do 
I think I'm going to stop? For the longest time I didn't understand what they were talking about. But

Chunk 3022 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I have to admit, at this point, I understand the value of cutting down your own risk. I could have 
traded smaller and had a smaller profit and smalle r risk. But if customer money comes in, I could 
use that to supplement the profitabil ity and still keep my risk lower. It just gives you a better deal. 
In a later interview, Dennis changed his mi nd on this subject, possi bly influenced by the

Chunk 3023 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
aggravation related to large losses  in his public funds. Dennis decide d to extricate hi mself gradually 
from the money management business, saying: "I found that it was more trouble than it was worth. 
The costs were not financial; they were psychologi cal." The material that follows is from that 
second interview. 
I know this is not going to be your favorite subj ect, but I've got to ask you about it. Some of

Chunk 3024 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the public funds you managed ceased trading in April 1988. Is that because they reached the 
automatic 50 percent loss cutoff point? 
Actually, they were down just under 49 percent when we stopped trading. Rather than trigger the  56automatic termination point, we liquidated all pos itions and resolicited the investors to allow a 
lower cutoff point. 
Would you do anything differently in the futu re because of this particular experience?

Chunk 3025 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I would cut back a little faster than I did, but the trades would st ill be the same. Someone said to 
me, "You claim the markets were bad. Well, si nce you could have done the exact opposite and 
made a lot of money, weren't they really good?" I told hi m that the last thing I would have wanted 
to do was to be on the oppos ite side of those trades. In the long ran, that is a way to lose an infinite 
amount of money.

Chunk 3026 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
amount of money. 
The short side of the interest rate markets in October 1987 resulted in one of your worst 
losses. What went wrong there? 
A large part of that loss was due to the fact that  the market gapped way past  our point for covering 
our short position. For example, on October 20, we would normally have been out of our short 
Eurodollar position about 40 to 50 points higher, but the market opened 240 points higher that day.

Chunk 3027 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
We blew 190 points in a skid th at was absolutely unavoidable. 
If the market is that much out of line, do you still get out of your position right away? 
Sure. If you have any doubt about getting out as fast as possible in a situati on like that, then you are 
really in big trouble. 
Do you think the sharp losses you suffered were due to any change in the markets? 
That's hard to say. The only factor  I can objectively identify is the tendency toward more false 
breakouts.

Chunk 3028 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
breakouts. 
Do you feel the recent prevalence of false breakouts is related to  the tremendous increase in 
computerized trend-following trading during the past five to ten years? Are there just too 
many people doing the same thin g, getting in each other's way? 
Yes, there is no doubt about it. In  a perverse sort of way, it repr esents the ultimate triumph of 
technical trading over fundamental trading. I say perverse because it  is a victory that devalues 
technical trading.

Chunk 3029 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
technical trading. 
Do you think we may see the day when trend-following systems no longer work? 
There will come a day when easily discovered and lightly conceived tr end-following systems no 
longer work. It is going to be harder to develop good systems. 
Given that, can the approaches you were using before still work with  the same efficacy? 
Actually, I believe that if you vi ew the problem correctly, you can make the fact that there are

Chunk 3030 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
many other trend followers in the market work to your advantage. I can't get too specific about the 
solution, because if we are right, that is pretty valuable informa tion. To be successful you always 
have to be one step ahead of everyone else. 
It sounds like you started working on this problem well before your performance problems 
began in late 1987. 
That's right. During the past ten years, there ha s been a virtual bandwagon-effect of people using

Chunk 3031 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trend-following approaches. We have been thinki ng about this problem for a long time. Half the 
work in solving a problem is finding the right way to  conceptualize it. It t ook us years before we 
figured out the right questions to ask. 
When did you finally arrive at what you considered a satisfactory solution? 
Ironically, right around the time we  closed down the public funds. 
I know you can't be specific, but does your solu tion to false breakouts involve being far more

Chunk 3032 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
short-term oriented, so th at you can respond more quickly to those situations? 
The secret is being as short term or as long te rm as you can stand, dependi ng on your trading style. 
It is the intermediate term that picks up the vast majority of trend followers. The best strategy is to 
avoid the middle like the plague. 
When you talk about the experience of managi ng well over $100 million and losing roughly 50

Chunk 3033 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
percent, not to mention your personal large lo sses, you discuss it with great emotional  57detachment. Do you really take it that calm ly? Isn't there an emotional side to it? 
I try for there not to be. It is totally counter productive to get wrapped up in the results. Trading 
decisions should be made as unemotionally as possible. 
Yes, but how do you do that? 
You have to maintain your perspective. There is  more to life than trading. Also, to me, being

Chunk 3034 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
emotionally deflated would mean lacking confidence in what I am doing. I avoid that because I 
have always felt that it is mislead ing to focus on short-term results. 
So you are able to avoid the emotional trap? 
Yes, but the flip side is that I also avoid the em otional elation when things are going well. There is 
no way to play just one side of that street. If  you feel too good when things are going well, then

Chunk 3035 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
inevitably you will feel too bad when they are go ing poorly. I wouldn't claim that I realized that 
after three years of trading, but after you've done it for twenty years, it e ither drives you crazy, or 
you learn to put it into perspective. 
Does it become easier after twenty years? 
Not necessarily [he laughs]. It gets easier to put it into perspective, but everyone has shock 
absorbers that deteriorate over time. Being a trader  is like being a boxer: Every now and then, the

Chunk 3036 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
market gives you a good wallop. After twenty years you get a bit punch-drunk. 
Is there any advice you can give to other trad ers on how to stay emotionally calm during 
periods of trading losses? 
It is a little bit like playi ng golf: You can throw your clubs around after making a bad shot, but 
while you are making the next shot you should keep your head down and your eye on the ball. 
Do you use long-term scenarios about economic growth, inflation, and the dollar in making

Chunk 3037 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
your trading decisions? 
I have mental pictures, but I try not to use them when I'm trading. Trading to me is like betting on 
independent roles of the dice that you think are loaded a little bit in your favor, because you know 
some statistical things about th e market. Long-term scenarios can prove to be right or wrong, but 
even if they are right, on balance, I'm not convin ced that they make much  difference over the term 
of any individual trade.

Chunk 3038 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
of any individual trade. 
Even if you think the dollar is going to colla pse, that doesn't affect your basic trading 
pattern? 
I would like to say it doesn't, and I don't think it should, but it probably has in the past. The worst 
thing you can do is miss a profit opportunity (assuming you are al ready disciplined enough to cut 
your losses short). And if you think about it, rigid long-term views ar e the kind of thing most likely

Chunk 3039 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to lead you to that mistake. For example, if I be lieve the dollar is going to weaken, and because of 
this I ignore a sell signal in the fo reign currencies, I might risk mi ssing a large profit. What is my 
reward if my view was right? Avoiding a small loss.  Therefore, the risk/rew ard is all wrong for my 
type of trading. 
Acknowledging that caveat, as a long-time mark et observer, what major trends do you see 
shaping up over the coming years?

Chunk 3040 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
shaping up over the coming years? 
I bet we will be at record levels of inflati on by the end of 1990. [This interview was conducted in 
mid-1988.] 
What is going to be the driving force behind that inflation? 
It is going to be driven by trying to avoid a de ep recession. The recession is going to be caused by 
the federal budget deficit as invest ors require higher and higher levels  of real interest rates to buy

Chunk 3041 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the debt. The' government will try to avoid the recession by stim ulating the economy, a tactic 
which essentially doesn't work. 
In other words, fear of a recessi on will cause tremendous moneta ry easing, which in turn will 
lead to inflation? 
It is, unfortunately, a very Republican idea, but I think it is right. Whethe r you like it or not, the

Chunk 3042 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
financial markets are in conservative hands. People who lend money to the government and  58business will not buy monetary eas ing as a soluti on to a recession. 
Are you implying that the defici t problem is just a time bomb , which will eventually shatter 
the economy? 
Sure. We tend to think that since it is not a pr oblem now, that means it won't be. We expect 
continuity in our lives, but the economy, and certainly the markets, are more  discontinuous than 
continuous.

Chunk 3043 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
continuous. 
And you are saying that people lo ok at the deficit year after year  and think, "Well, it can't be 
so bad, the economy is strong," and one day everybody wakes up— 
It is like having termites in th e foundation of your house. You ma y not notice them until one day 
they gnaw away a big chunk and the house collapse s. I don't think any body should take a large 
amount of comfort in the fact that th ings appear to be holding together.

Chunk 3044 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Hypothetically, if you were President and coul d influence change, would the deficit be the 
first thing you would change? 
Sure. I think it is especially important for Democrat s, since they were the fi rst ones to pick up the 
banner of Keynesianism [the advocacy of government programs to increase employment], to admit 
that while it may be a great theor y, it doesn't work in the real world. 
I don't think Keynes ever proposed using defi cit spending in strong economic times.

Chunk 3045 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
No, that's true. He proposed surp luses that were supposed to be  countercyclical to deficits. 
Surpluses in good times; deficits in bad times. The trouble is that we have  only one side of that 
equation because of the lack of political will to  create the surpluses wh en times are good. So what 
we really ought to do is admit that Keynesian economics is just an excuse for easy money, 
overspending, and overconsuming. We ought to just ad mit that the government is a debt junkie and

Chunk 3046 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the whole concept of deficit sp ending is flawed in practice. 
You mean Keynesianism as it is being app lied, not Keynesian econo mics as he himself 
purported it? 
The theory is fine, it just doesn't work in the real world. Therefore, we shouldn't use it. Besides, 
Keynesian economics was a solution to the pr oblem of oversaving and underconsumption, which 
was a fair enough attempt to pull us out of the Great Depression. The problem  now is the exact

Chunk 3047 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
opposite: undersaving and overconsum ption. Even if Keynesianism were politically tenable, you 
still need a different solution becaus e you have the exact opposite problem. 
Is there an economic theory that you f eel fits the times and makes sense? 
We have to get rid of deficit spending. We need to retire the deficit in some orderly way, and the 
federal government should have to balance its budget just as the st ates do. At that  point, Milton

Chunk 3048 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Friedman's proposal for a constant  money supply adjusted by a grow th factor would probably be a 
good idea. 
What is the most important advice  you could give the novice trader? 
Trade small because that's when you are as bad as you are ever going to be. Learn from your 
mistakes. Don't be misled by the day-to-day fluctu ations in your equity. Focus on whether what you 
are doing is right, not on the random na ture of any single trade's outcome.

After Dennis announced his retirement from trading to pursue his political interests full time, I 
called with some follow-up questions. I spoke to an aide who took down the questions. Several 
days later, he called back with Dennis' re plies. These questions and answers follow. 
Individuals who invested in your funds durin g your final year as a money manager fared 
poorly. How would an investor ha ve done if he started on you r first day as a money manager

Chunk 3050 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
and kept his money fully invested until your last day in that role? 
Each $1,000 invested would have been worth $3,833 when the accounts were closed. [This works 
out to approximately a 25 percent annual compounde d return. The figure would have been more 
than double that at the equity peak about one year earlier.] 
You are rumored to have lost a very substantial portion of your own net worth during your

Chunk 3051 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
final year of trading. Are thes e stories true or exaggerated?  59I lost about 10 percent of the money I had made  in the markets. Of course, measured as a 
percentage of my net worth, the figure is much  higher because of my charitable and political 
contributions over the years. 
Did your poor trading results during the pa st year speed your career transitions? 
It made no difference. 
Have you really gone cold turkey, or are you still trading lightly? 
I am not trading at all.

Richard Dennis is one of the legendary commodity tr aders of our time. He is the type of trader you 
might visualize implementing large long positions near market bottoms and large short positions 
near market tops. It is thus su rprising that Dennis downplays the value of trying to pick major 
turning points. In fact, he claims that such trades have done little, if anything, to contribute to his 
trading success.

Chunk 3053 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trading success. 
Dennis believes that one of the worst mistakes a trader can make is to miss a major profit 
opportunity. According to his own estimate, 95 pe rcent of his profits have come from only 5 
percent of his trades. Missing only a few such pr ofit opportunities could ha ve a dramatic negative 
impact on performance. As a corollary, you need to  guard against holding too rigid an opinion on a 
market, since such an opinion could easily lead to missing a major trend.

Chunk 3054 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
One particularly useful piece of advice offered by  Dennis is that the times  when you least want to 
think about trading—the losing pe riods—are precisely the times wh en you need to focus most on 
trading. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  60Paul Tudor Jones-The Art of Aggressive Trading 
October 1987 was a devastating month for most i nvestors as the world stock markets witnessed a

Chunk 3055 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
collapse that rivaled 1929. That same month, th e Tudor Futures Fund, managed by Paul Tudor 
Jones, registered an incredible 62 percent retur n. Jones has always been a maverick trader. His 
trading style is unique and his performance is uncorrelated with other money managers. Perhaps 
most important, he has done what many thought impo ssible: combine five consecutive, triple-digit 
return years with very low equity retracements. (I  am fudging slightly; in 1986, Paul's fund realized

Chunk 3056 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
only a 99.2 percent gain!) 
Jones has succeeded in every major venture he has tried. He started out in the business as a broker 
and in his second year grossed over $1 million in commissions. In fall 1980, Jones went to the New 
York Cotton Exchange as an independent floor trader. Again he was spectacularly successful, 
making millions during the next few years. His r eally impressive achievement though was not the

Chunk 3057 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
magnitude of his winnings, but the consistency of  his performance: During his three and a half 
years as a floor trader, he witnessed only one losing month. 
In 1984, partially out of boredom, and partially out of fear of eventually losing his voice—an 
occupational hazard for a pit trader— Jones agai n abandoned his successful career for a new 
venture: money management. He launched the Tudor Futures Fund in September 1984 with $1.5

Chunk 3058 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
million under management. At the end of Oct ober 1988, each $1,000 invested in this fund was 
worth $17,482, while the total amount of money he  managed had grown to $330 million. In fact, 
the amount under management would have b een higher, but Jones stopped accepting new 
investment funds in October 1987 and has also  made cash disbursements since that time. 
If one believes in cycles—as Jones does—it appears that he is due fo r another career change. It is

Chunk 3059 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
hard to imagine what he can do for an encore. 
Jones is a compendium of contrasts.  In private conversation he is re laxed, but as a trader he shouts 
his orders with the ferocity of a drill sergeant. His public image is  one of a swaggering, egotistical 
trader, but one-on-one he is  easygoing and unassuming. The medi a usually dramatizes the 
flamboyant elements of his lifestyle—Chesa peake Bay Mansion, private 3,000-acre wildlife

Chunk 3060 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
preserve, beautiful women, fine restaurants—but he has also made helping the poor a second 
avocation. 
Jones has emulated New York businessman E ugene Lang by setting up a fund to finance the 
college education of eighty-five elementary sc hool graduates in Brooklyn's economically depressed 
Bedford-Stuyvesant section. This is not merely  a matter of donating money; Jones has become 
personally involved by meeting with  his adopted students weekly. More recently, he started the

Chunk 3061 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Robin Hood Foundation, whose endowment has grown to $5 million. This organization, true to its 
name, raises money from the rich and distributes it to private groups and indivi duals working to aid 
the poor. 
Jones had arranged our interview for 3:15 P.M., a time by which all the futures markets are closed, 
except for the stock indexes. Even with only one market trading, I was a little concerned about the

Chunk 3062 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
practicality of starting the interv iew at that time, since I knew that the S&P stock index futures 
contract was one of Jones' primary trading vehicles . In fact, when I arrived he was in the midst of 
trading the S&P. 
I waited until he finished shouting orders over the speakerphone and explaine d that I did not want 
to interrupt his trading. "Maybe we  should delay the interview until th e market closes," I suggested. 
"No problem," he answered, "let's go."

Chunk 3063 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
"No problem," he answered, "let's go." 
As it turned out, Jones was not merely trading the S&P that afternoon, he  was building up a major 
position in anticipation of  a huge break in the stock market. There is an intensity in Jones' 
placement of an order that is reminiscent of a te nnis player aggressively returning a volley. ("Buy 
300 at even! Go, go, go! Are we in? Speak to me!") Yet, he shifted easily between trading and our 
conversation.

Chunk 3064 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
conversation. 
Jones speaks with admiration abou t his first tutor in the business,  the legendary co tton trader, Eli 
Tullis. Perhaps the one trait of Tullis that made the greatest impression on Jones was his steel-hard 
emotional control. He recalls how  Tullis could carry on a polite, relaxed conversation with visitors,

Chunk 3065 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
without blinking an eye, at the same time his positions were getting decimated in the market.  61Jones' casualness in seeing visitors, talking to his staff, and participating in this interview at the 
same time he was trading a heavy S&P position reflected the same trait. A rally in stock index 
futures in the closing minutes of trading that day caused over a $ 1 million loss in Jones' position.

Chunk 3066 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yet, he was so composed that I didn't realize th e market had moved agains t him until I checked the 
closing prices later that day. 
There was insufficient time to complete the inte rview at our first meeti ng. I returned about two 
weeks later. Two things were notable about this se cond meeting. First, wh ereas he had been 
strongly bearish and heavily short the stock market  at the time of our first conversation, Jones'

Chunk 3067 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
short-term opinion on the stock market had shifted to bullish in the interim. The failure of the stock 
market to follow through on the downside at the pr ice and time he had anticipated convinced him 
that the market was headed higher for the short term. 
"This market is sold out," he emphasized at our second meeting. Th is 180-degree sh ift in opinion 
within a short time span exemplified the extreme flexibility that underlies Jones' trading success.

Chunk 3068 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
He not only quickly abandoned his original position, but was willing to join the other side once the 
evidence indicated his initial pr ojection was wrong. (Yes, his change  of heart proved well timed.) 
Second, Jones had suddenly adopted a very cautious tone regarding projecti ons p Ttaining to the 
stock market and the economy. He was concerned that a second major selling wave in the stock 
market—the first being October 1987—could lead to  a type of financial Mc-Carthyism. Indeed,

Chunk 3069 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
there is historical precedence fo r such concern: During the Sena te hearings held  in the 1930s, 
committee members were so desperat e to find villain s responsible for the 1929 stock crash that they 
dragged up New York Stock Exch ange officials who had held long positions du ring the price 
collapse. 
Jones feared that, as a prominent speculator and forecaster of economic tr ends, he might make a

Chunk 3070 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
convenient target for any future governmental witch- hunts. Jones had been part icularly rattled by a 
call from a prominent government official regard ing his trading. "You wouldn't believe how high-
placed this person was," he explained to me in a voice tinged with incredulity, taking particular 
care not to divulge anything specific. 
Although Jones remained friendly, the directness of the first interview was replaced by an almost

Chunk 3071 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
prerecorded quality in his replies. For example,  a question about trading strategy was met with a 
response about frmit-running^-an illegal prac tice in which a broker places his own order 
m^ront~oralarge customer order. This reply virtua lly bordered on the absurd  since Jones handles no 
customer orders. It made as much sense as a f ootball fan, who bets in his office pool, denying that 
he took a bribe to throw the game. It sounded as if Jones was using the interview as a forum for

Chunk 3072 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
making an official statement, perhaps to be used as evidence in some hypothetical future 
congressional hearing. I thought that Jones wa s being overly cautious—if not paranoid—but then 
again, the expectation that a true economic crisis  would lead to "killin g the messengers of bad 
news" does not really seem that far-fetched. 
When did you first get interested in trading? 
When I was in college I read an article on Rich ard Dennis, which made a big impression on me. I

Chunk 3073 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
thought that Dennis had the greate st job in the world. I already had an appreciation for trading 
because my uncle, Billy Dunavant, was a very su ccessful cotton trader. In 1976, after I finished 
college, I went to my uncle and asked him if he coul d help me get started as a trader. He sent me to 
Eli Tullis, a famous cotton trader, w ho lived in New Orleans. "Eli is the best trader I know," he told

Chunk 3074 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
me. I went down to see Eli and he offered me a job on the floor of the New York Cotton Exchange. 
How come you went to work for Eli instead of your uncle? 
Because my uncle was primarily involved in the cash side of the business, merchandising cotton. I 
was interested in becoming a trader straightaway. 
How long did you work on the floor of the exchange? What was your job there? 
I was a floor clerk; that is how everybody begins. But I also did a lo t of analytical work, watching

Chunk 3075 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the market to try to figure out what made it tick.  I clerked in New York for about six months and 
then returned to New Orleans to work for Eli. 
Did you learn a lot about trading from Eli?  62Absolutely. Working with Eli was a fabulous e xperience. He would trade position sizes of 3,000 
contracts when the entire mark et open interest was only 30,000. He would trade more volume than 
any cotton trader off the floor. He was a true sight to behold.

Chunk 3076 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Was he trading futures against cash or just speculating? 
He was a pure speculator. The am azing thing was that since he us ed his own broker on the floor, 
everyone always knew exactly what his position was.  He was very easy to tag. Eli's attitude was, 
"The hell with it, I'm goi ng to take them head on." 
So everyone knew his hand? 
Definitely. 
But, apparently, it didn't hurt him? 
No. 
Is that an exception? Do you try to hide your positions?

Chunk 3077 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I try. But, realistically, the guys in  the pit who have been there for five or ten years know it is me. 
Everyone knows when I trade. The one thing I learne d from Eli is that, ultimately, the market is 
going to go where it is going to go. 
So you don't think it is impo rtant to hide your positions? 
I think it is important to make an effort. For instance, my orders used  to be particularly easy to read

Chunk 3078 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
because I traded in multiples of 300 contracts. Now I break my orders up; I might give one broker 
an order for 116 and another broker an order for 184.1 have at least four brokers in every pit. 
What else did you learn from Tullis? 
He was the toughest son of a bitch I ever knew. He  taught me that trading is very competitive and 
you have to be able to handl e getting your butt kicked. No matter how you cut it, there are 
enormous emotional ups and downs involved.

Chunk 3079 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
enormous emotional ups and downs involved. 
That sounds like a general character-buildin g lesson. What about specifics regarding 
trading? 
Tullis taught me about moving volume. When you are trading size, you have to get out when the 
market lets you out, not when you want to get out. He  taught me that if you want to move a large 
position, you don't wait until the market is in ne w high or low ground because very little volume 
may trade there if it is a turning point.

Chunk 3080 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
may trade there if it is a turning point. 
One thing I learned as a floor tr ader was that if, for example, the old high was at 56.80, there are 
probably going to be a lot of buy stops at 56.85. If  the market is trading 70 aid, 75 offered, the 
whole trading ring has a vested interest in buying the market, touchi ng off those stops, and 
liquidating into the stops—that is a very common ring practice. As an upstairs trader, I put that

Chunk 3081 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
together with what Eli taught me. If I want to c over a position in that type of situation, I will 
liquidate half at 75, so that I won't have to worry about getting out of the en tire position at the point 
where the stops are being hit. I will always liquida te half my position below new highs or lows and 
the remaining half beyond that point. 
Any other lessons you can attribute to Tullis? 
By watching Eli, I learned that even though markets look their very best when they are setting new

Chunk 3082 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
highs, that is often th e best time to sell. He inst illed in me the idea that, to  some extent, to be a good 
trader, you have to be a contrarian. 
You have done tens of thousands of trades. Is there any single trade that stands out? 
Yes, the 1979 cotton market. One leams the most fr om mistakes, not successes. I was a broker back 
then. We had lots of speculative accounts and I was long about 400 contracts of July cotton. The

Chunk 3083 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
market had been trading in a range between 82 and 86 cents, and I was buying it every time it came 
down to the low end of that range. 
One day, the market broke to new lows, took out the stops, and immediatel y rebounded about 30 or 
40 points. I thought the reason the market had been acting so poorly was because of the price 
vulnerability implied by the prox imity of those well-known stops. Now that the stops had been

Chunk 3084 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
touched off, I thought the ma rket was ready to rally.  63I was standing outside the ring at th e time. In an act of bravado, I to ld my floor broker to bid 82.90 
for 100 July, which at the time was a very big or der. He bid 90 for 100, a nd I remember the Refco 
broker came running across the pit sc reaming, "Sold!" Refco owned mo st of the certificated stock 
at that time [the type of cotton available for delive ry against the contract]. In an instant I realized

Chunk 3085 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that they intended to deliver agai nst the July contract, which then  was trading at about a 4-cent 
premium to the October contract. It also dawned on me that the whole congestion pattern that had 
formed between 82 and 86 cents was going to be a market measurement for the next move down 
[the break from 82 cents was going to equal the width of the prior 4-cent trading range]. 
So you knew you were wrong immediately?

Chunk 3086 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
So you knew you were wrong immediately? 
I saw immediately that the market was going strai ght down to 78 cents, and that it was my blood 
that was going to carry it there. I had come in long 400 cont racts, entered another 100 as a day 
trade, and a final 100 on that macho-type  bid that I should never have made. 
So you realized instantly that you wanted to be out. 
No, I realized instantly that  I wanted to be short.  
How fast did you react?

Chunk 3087 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How fast did you react? 
Almost immediately. When the Refco broker shout ed, "Sold," everyone in the ring turned around 
and looked at me, because they knew what I was tr ying to do. The guy standing next to me said, "If 
you want to go to the bathroom, do it right here."  He said I looked three shades of white. I 
remember turning around, walking out , getting a drink of water, and then telling my broker to sell

Chunk 3088 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
as much as he could. The market was limit-down in sixty seconds, and I was only able to sell 220 
contracts. 
When did you get out of the rest of your position? 
The next morning the market opened 100 points lowe r and I started selling from the opening bell. I 
sold only about 150 contracts before the market locked limit-down again. By the time it was all 
over, I ended up selling some contracts as much as  4 cents below the point I first knew the position 
was no good.

Chunk 3089 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
was no good. 
Even though you reacted fairly quickly, you still took a big hit. In retrospect, what should you 
have done? 
First of all, never play macho man with the market. Second, neve r overtrade. My major problem 
was not the number of points I lo st on the trade, but that I wa s trading far too many contracts 
relative to the equity in the accounts that I handled. My account s lost something like 60 to 70 
percent of their equity in that single trade.

Chunk 3090 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
percent of their equity in that single trade. 
Did that particular trade change your whole trading style in terms of risk? 
Absolutely. I was totally demoralized. I said, "I am  not cut out for this business; I don't think I can 
hack it much longer." I was so depressed that I nearly quit. 
How many years had you been in  the business at that time? 
Only about three and a half years. 
Had you been successful up to that point?

Chunk 3091 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Had you been successful up to that point? 
Relatively. Most of my clients had made money, and I was an im portant producer for my company. 
How about someone who had given you $10,000 at the beginning of the three-year period? 
They were probably up about threefold. 
So everyone who was with you for a lo ng time was still ahead of the game? 
Yes, but I had to suffer some intense drawdowns during the interim. That cotton trade was almost

Chunk 3092 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the deal-breaker for me. It was at that point th at I said, "Mr. Stupid, why risk everything on one 
trade? Why not make your life a purs uit of happiness rath er than pain?" 
That was when I first decided I had to learn disc ipline and money management. It was a cathartic 
experience for me, in the sense that I went to the edge, questioned my very ability as a trader, and 
decided that I was not going to quit. I was determin ed to come back and fight. I decided that I was

Chunk 3093 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
going to become very disciplined and businesslike about my trading.  64Did your trading style change ra dically from that point on? 
Yes. Now I spend my day trying to  make myself as happy and re laxed as I can be. If I have 
positions going against me, I get right out; if they are going forme, I keep them. 
I guess you not only started tradi ng smaller, but also quicker? 
Quicker and more defensive. I am always thi nking about losing money as opposed to making

Chunk 3094 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
money. Back then, in that cotton trade, I had a vision of July going to 89 cents and I thought about 
all the money I was going to make on 400 contra cts. I didn't think about what I could lose. 
Do you always know where you are gett ing out before you put a trade on? 
I have a mental stop. If it hits that number, I am out no matter what. How much do you risk on any 
single trade? 
I don't break it down trade by trade. All the trades I have on are interrela ted. I look at it in terms of

Chunk 3095 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
what my equity is each morning. My goal is to fi nish each day with more than I started. Tomorrow 
morning I will not walk in and say, "I am short th e S&P from 264 and it closed at 257 yesterday; 
therefore, I can stand a rally." I always think of it in terms of being short from the previous night's 
close. 
Risk control is the most important thing in trad ing. For example, right now  I am down about 6'/ 2

Chunk 3096 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
percent for the топшТТНауе  а З'б percent stop on my equity for th e rest of the month. I want to 
make sure that I never have a double-digit loss in any month. 
One aspect of your trading style is a contrarian  attempt to buy and sell turning points. Let's 
say you are looking for a top and go short with a close stop when the market reaches a new 
high. You then get stopped out. On a single trade idea, how many times will you try to pick a 
turning point before you give up?

Chunk 3097 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
turning point before you give up? 
Until I change my mind, fundamentally. Otherwise, I will keep cutting my position size down as I 
have losing trades. When I am trading poorly, I k eep reducing my position size.  That way, I will be 
trading my smallest position size when my trading is worst. 
What are the trading rules you live by? 
Don't ever average losers. Decrease your tradi ng volume when you are trading poorly; increase

Chunk 3098 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
your volume when you are trading well. Never trade in situations where you don't have control. For 
example, I don't risk significant amounts of money in front of key reports, since that is gambling, 
not trading. 
If you have a losing position that is making you uncomfortable, the solution is very simple: Get out, 
because you can always get back in. There is nothing better than a fresh start. 
Don't be too concerned about where you got into a position. The only relevant question is whether

Chunk 3099 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
you are bullish or bearish on the position that day. Al ways think of your entry point as last night's 
close. I can always tell a rookie trader because he  will ask me, "Are you s hort or long?" Whether I 
am long or short should have no bearing on his market opinion. Next he will ask (assuming I have 
told him I am long), "Where are you long from?"  Who cares where I am long from. That has no 
relevance to whether the market environment is bu llish or bearish right now, or to the risk/reward

Chunk 3100 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
balance of a long position at that moment. 
The most important rale of trading is to play gr eat defense, not great offe nse. Every day I assume 
every position I have is wrong. I know where my stop ri sk points are going to be. I do that so I can 
define my maximum possible drawdown. Hopefully, I spend the rest of the day enjoying positions 
that are going in my direction. If they are going against me, then I ha ve a game plan for getting out.

Chunk 3101 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Don't be a hero. Don't have an ego. Always ques tion yourself and your abilit y. Don't ever feel that

Jesse Livermore, one of the greatest speculators of all time, reportedly sa id that, in the long ran, 
you can't ever win trading markets. That was a de vastating quote for someone like me, just getting

before? 
I am more scared now than I was at any point  since I began trading, because I recognize how  65ephemeral success can be in this business. I know that  to be successful, I have to be frightened. My

I have very strong views of the l ong-ran direction of all markets. I also have a very short-term

Chunk 3104 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
horizon for pain. As a result, frequently, I may try repeated trades from the long side over a period 
of weeks in a market which continues to move lower. 
Is it a matter of doing a series of  probes until you finally hit it? 
Exactly. I consider myself a premier market opportunist. That means I develop an idea on the 
market and pursue it from a very-low-risk standpoi nt until I have repeatedly  been proven wrong, or 
until I change my viewpoint.

Chunk 3105 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
until I change my viewpoint. 
In other words, it makes a better story to say, "Paul Jones buys the T-bond market 2 ticks 
from the low," rather than, "On his fifth try, Paul Jones buys th e T-bond market 2 ticks from 
its low." 
I think that is certainly part of it. The other part is that I have always been a swing trader, meaning 
that I believe the very best money is to be made  at the market turns. Ev eryone says you get killed

Chunk 3106 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trying to pick tops and bottoms and you make a ll the money by catching the trends in the middle. 
Well, for twelve years, I have of ten been missing the meat in the middle, but I have caught a lot of 
bottoms and tops. 
If you are a trend follower trying to catch the profits  in the middle of a move, you have to use very 
wide stops. I'm not comfortable doing that. Also, markets trend onl y about 15 percent of the time; 
the rest of the time they move sideways.

Chunk 3107 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the rest of the time they move sideways. 
What is the most prominent fallacy in  the public's percepti on about markets? 
That markets can be manipulated. That there is so me group on Wall Street that controls price action 
in the markets. I can go into any market and create  a stir for a day or two, maybe even a week. If I 
go into a market at just the right moment, by gi ving it a little gas on the upside, I can create the

Chunk 3108 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
illusion of a bull market. But, unless the market is  really sound, the second I stop buying, the price 
is going to come right down. You can open the most beautiful Saks  Fifth Avenue in Anchorage, 
Alaska, with a wonderful summer menswear de partment, but unless somebody wants to buy the 
clothes, you will go broke. 
What other misconceptions do people have about the markets? 
The idea that people affiliated with Wall Street know  something. My mother is a classic example.

Chunk 3109 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
She watches "Wall Street Week" and she takes everyt hing they say with almost a religious fervor. I 
would bet that you could probably fade "Wall Street Week." 
I know you talk to traders in virtually every ma jor market on an almost daily basis. Are you 
uncomfortable about being on the opposite  side of the fence from these people? 
Yes. Who wants to fade a winner? I want to be with them because I make a point of talking to the 
people who have the best track records.

Chunk 3110 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
people who have the best track records. 
How do you keep all these other opinions from  confusing your own vision? Let's say you are 
bearish on a market and 75 percent of the people you talk to about that market are bullish. What 
do you do?  
I wait. I will give you a perfect example. Until last Wednesday, I had been bearish on crude oil, 
while it was in the midst of a $2 advance. The best crude oil trader I know was bullish during that

Chunk 3111 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
period. Because he was bullish, I never went short. Then the market started to stall and one day he 
said, "I think I am going to go flat here." I knew that instant— particular ly, given the fact that 
bullish news was coming out of OPEC right at that time—that crude oil was a low-risk short. I sold 
the hell out of it, and it turn ed out to be a great trade.

Chunk 3112 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Are there any market advisors that you pay attention to?  66Marty Zweig and Ned Davis are great; Bob Prechter  is the champion. Prechter is the best because 
he is the ultimate market opportunist. 
What do you mean by opportunist? 
The reason he has been so successful is that the Elliott Wave theory allows one to create incredibly 
favorable risk/reward opportunities. That is the sa me reason I attribute a lot of my own success to 
the Elliott Wave approach.

Chunk 3113 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the Elliott Wave approach. 
Any advisor you consider underrated? 
I think Ned Davis does the best research on the stock market that I have seen. Although he is well 
known, I don't think he has received the recognition he deserves. 
Any analysts you consider overrated? 
Judge not, least you be judged. 
Very few traders have reached your level of  achievement. What makes you different? 
I think one of my strengths is that I view anythi ng that has happened up to the present point in time

Chunk 3114 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
as history. I really don't care about the mistake I ma de three seconds ago in the market. What I care 
about is what I am going to do from the next mome nt on. I try to avoid any emotional attachment to 
a market. I avoid letting my trading opinions be influenced by comments I may have made on the 
record about a market. 
No loyalty to positions is obviously an important element in your trading.

Chunk 3115 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
It is important because it gives you a wide open intellectual horiz on to figure out what is really 
happening. It allows you to come in with a comple tely clean slate in choosing the correct forecast 
for that particular market. 
Has the tremendous growth of the money you are managing made it more difficult to trade at 
the same level of profitability? 
It has made it tremendously more difficult. 
Do you think you could make a substantially higher percentage return  if you were trading

Chunk 3116 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
smaller amounts of money? 
Without question. 
Do you ever question whether the detrimental impact of size on your performance outweighs 
profit incentive fees you earn from managing money? 
I think about that question every day. It is going to  be interesting to see what happens by the time 
your book is published. 
Have you stopped accepting new investment funds? 
Yes, a long time ago. 
You have been both a broker and a money ma nager. How do you compare the relative

Chunk 3117 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
advantages and disadvantages of these two jobs? 
I got out of the brokerage business because I felt there was a gross conflict of interest: If you are 
charging a client commissions and he loses mone y, you aren't penalized. I went into the money 
management business because if I lost money, I wa nted to be able to say that I had not gotten 
compensated for it. In fact, it would probably co st me a bundle because I have an overhead that

Chunk 3118 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
would knock out the Bronx Zoo. I never apologize to anybody, because I don't get paid unless I 
win. 
Do you keep your money in your own funds? 
I would say that 85 percent of my net worth is invested in my own fu nds, primarily because I 
believe that is the safest place in the world for it. I really believe that I am going to be so defensive 
and conservative that I will get my money back. 
You did extraordinarily well during October 1987, a month which was a disaster for many

Chunk 3119 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
other traders. Could you fill in some of the details? 
The week of the crash was one of th e most exciting periods of my life. 
We had been expecting a major stock market collapse since mid-1986 and had contingency plans  67drawn up because of the possibility we foresaw for a financial meltdown. When we came in on 
Monday, October 19, we knew that the ma rket was going to crash that day. 
What made you so sure?

Chunk 3120 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
What made you so sure? 
Because the previous Friday was a record volume day on the downside. The exact same thing 
happened in 1929, two days before the crash. Our analog model to 1929 had the coll apse perfectly 
nailed. [Paul Jones' analog model, developed by hi s research director, Pete r Borish, superimposed 
the 1980s market over the 1920s mark et. The two markets demonstrated a remarkable degree of

Chunk 3121 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
correlation. This model was a key tool in Jone s' stock index tradin g during 1987.] Treasury 
Secretary Baker's weekend statement that the U.S.  would no longer support th e dollar beca use of its 
disagreements with West Germany was the kiss of death for the market. 
When did you cover your short position? 
We actually covered our shorts and went somewhat  long on the close of the day of the crash itself 
[October 19].

Chunk 3122 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
[October 19]. 
Were most of your profits in October due  to your short stock index position? 
No, we also had an extremely profitable bond positi on. The day of the crash we put on the biggest 
bond position we ever had. The bond market had been  acting terrible all day long on October 19. 
During the day, I was very concerne d about the financial safety of our clients' and our own assets. 
We had our assets with various commission houses on the street, and I thought those funds could be

Chunk 3123 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
in jeopardy. It was an into lerable situation for me. 
I kept on thinking: What is the Fed reaction going to be? I t hought that thev would have to add 
massive amounts of liquidity to create a very ro sy environment, instantaneously. However, since 
bonds had been acting poorly all day, I couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger on a long bond 
position. During the last half hour of  trading, bonds suddenly started to  turn up, and it clicked in my

Chunk 3124 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
mind that the Fed was going to take actions that  would create a tremendous upsurge in bond prices. 
As soon as I saw the bond market ac t right for a moment, I went wild. 
Do you believe that October 1987 was an early wa rning signal of more negative times ahead? 
I think the financial community, particularly Wall Street, was d ealt a life-threatening blow on 
October 19, but they are in shock and don't realize it. I remember the time I got run over by a boat,

Chunk 3125 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
and my backside was chewed up by the propeller. My  first thought was, "Damm it, I just ruined my 
Sunday afternoon because I have to get stitched up." Because I was in shock, I didn't even realize 
how badly cut up I was until I saw the faces of my friends. 
Everything gets destroyed a hundred times faster than  it is built up. It takes one day to tear down 
something that might have taken ten years to buil d. If the economy starts to  go with the kind of

Chunk 3126 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
leverage that is in it, it will deteriorate so fast that people's heads will spin. I hate to believe it, but 
in my gut that is what I think is going to happen. 
I know from studying history that cr edit eventually kills all great societies. We ha ve essentially 
taken out our American Express card and said we ar e going to have a great time. Reagan made sure 
that the economy would be great during his term in office by borrowing our way into prosperity.

Chunk 3127 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
We borrowed against the future, and soon we will have to pay. 
Are you blaming the current situation on Reaganomics? 
I think Reagan made us feel good as a countr y—and that is wonderful— but, in terms of 
economics, he was the biggest disa ster that ever struck. I thi nk he basically hoodwinked us by 
promising to cut the deficit, and then went on th e biggest spending binge in  the history of this

Chunk 3128 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
country. I don't think a Democrat could have gotte n away with it, becaus e everyone would have 
been very vigilant about  a $150-180 billion deficit. 
Do you see any way in which we can solve our current problems before we go into a deep 
recession, or even depression? 
That is what scares me so much. I don't see any blueprint out of our curr ent dilemma. Maybe there 
are macroeconomic forces at work that are part of a larger super cycle that we don't have any

Chunk 3129 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
control over. Perhaps we are simply responding to the same type of cycles that most advanced 
civilizations fell prey to, whether it was the Ro mans, sixteenth-century Spain, eighteenth-century  68France, or nineteenth-century Britain. I think that we are going to be in for a period of pain. We are 
going to relearn what financ ial discipline is all about. 
Do you use trading systems at all? 
We have tested every system under the sun and, amazingly, we have found one that actually works

Chunk 3130 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
well. It is a very good system, but for obvious reasons, I can't tell you much more about it. 
What type of realm does it fall  into: contrarian? trend following? 
Trend following. The basic premise of the system is that markets move sharply when they move. If 
there is a sudden range expansion in  a market that has been trading narrowly, human nature is to try 
to fade that price move. When you get a range e xpansion, the market is sending you a very loud,

Chunk 3131 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
clear signal that the market is getting ready to  move in the direction of that expansion. 
Are you trading a portion of your funds on that system at the present time? 
We just started trading the system about six months ago, and so far it is doing very well. 
Do you feel a good system can compete with a good trader? 
A good system may be able to trad e more markets effectively than a good trader because it has the

Chunk 3132 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
advantage of unlimited computing power. After all,  every trade decision is  the product of some 
problem-solving process—human or otherwise. Howe ver, because of the complexity in defining 
interacting and changing market patterns, a good trader will us ually be able to outperform a good 
system. 
But a good system can help diversify? 
Unequivocally. A good system will catch ten times as  much of the price move  as I will, during the

Chunk 3133 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
15 percent of the time a market is in a major trending phase. 
The following section of the interview was conducted two weeks later. During the interim, Jones 
had reversed his trading bias on the stock market from bearish to bullish. 
Two weeks ago you were very bearish. What made you change your mind? 
You mean besides the Wall Street Journal article that publicized to th e world that I was short 2,000

Chunk 3134 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
S&P contracts? The market didn't go down. The first thing I do is put  my ear to the railroad tracks. 
I always believe that prices move  first and fundamentals come second. 
Do you mean that if you were right, pri ces should have gone down and the didn't? 
and; they didn't? 
One of the things that Tullis taught me was the im portance of time. When I trade, I don't just use a 
price stop, I also use a time stop. If I think a mark et should break, and it doesn't, I will often get out

Chunk 3135 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
even if I am not losing any money. According to  the 1929 analog model, the market should have 
gone down — it didn't. This was the first time duri ng the past three years that we had a serious 
divergence. I think the strength of the econom y is going to delay the stock market break. 
I believe one reason why we are diverging from the 1 929 model is because of the much easier 
availability of credit today. Vol vo is giving out 120-month car loan s. Think about that! Who owns a

Chunk 3136 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
car for ten years? Twenty years ago, the averag e length of a car loan was twenty-four months; 
today it is fifty-five months. I thi nk the final bottom line will be the same, but the ease of credit will 
delay the process rela tive to the 1920s, when we had a cash economy. 
Some of your preliminary co mments before the start of our interview today make it sound 
like you are paranoid because of your success.

Chunk 3137 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
like you are paranoid because of your success. 
If the misery in this country ge ts deep enough, the perception is go ing to be that we did well as a 
trading firm, while other people were hurt, because  we had some knowledge. It is not that we had 
any unfair knowledge that other peop le didn't have, it is just that  we did our homework. People just 
don't want to believe that anyone can break away  from the crowd and ri se above mediocrity.

Chunk 3138 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I understand that, similar to a number of other tr aders I have interviewed, you have trained a 
group of apprentice traders. What was your motivation? 
When I was twenty-one years old, a guy took me unde r his wing and it was th e greatest thing that 
ever happened to me. I felt an obligation to do the same thing for other people.  69How did you find the people you trained? 
Countless interviews. We have been deluged by applicants. 
How many traders have you hired? 
About thirty-five.

Chunk 3139 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
About thirty-five. 
Have they been successful? 
Some have done very well, but overall we have had mixed success. 
Do you believe that is because it takes talent to be a good trader? 
I never thought that before, but I am starting to believe that now. One of my weaknesses is that I 
always tend to be too optimistic, particularly about the ability of ot her people to succeed. 
Was your I Have a Dream Program, in which you have pledged to sponsor the education of a

Chunk 3140 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
group of kids from a poverty sticken area, in spired by the "60 Minutes" show about Eugene 
Lang? 
Right. I went to talk to him the week after the show, and within three months we had set up our 
own program. I have always been a big believer in  leverage. The thing that really turned me on 
about the program was the potential for its multiplic ative impact. By helping one kid, you can have 
an impact on his family and other kids.

Chunk 3141 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
an impact on his family and other kids. 
We have also recently set up a new program cal led the Robin Hood Foundation. We are trying to 
seek out and fund people who are on the frontlines in providing f ood and shelter to the poor. We 
are seeking out the people who are used to working with virtually no budget at all, rather than the 
bureaucracies, which often do not deploy the money effectively. 
Has this become a major part of your life?

Chunk 3142 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Has this become a major part of your life? 
I would say so. The markets have been so good to me  that I feel I should give back something in 
return. I can't say that I have been successful be cause I am better than anybody else. By the grace of 
God, I was in the right place at the right time, so I feel a tremendous obligation to share. 
Is the positive intensity of winning as strong as the pain of losing?

Chunk 3143 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
There is nothing worse than a bad trading day. You feel so low that it is difficult to hold your head 
up. But, if I knew that I could also have a simila r experience in the exhilaration of winning, I would 
take the combination of winning a nd losing days any time because you  feel that much more alive. 
Trading gives you an incredibly in tense feeling of what life is all about. Emoti onally, you live on 
the extremes. 
What is the most important advice you could give the average trader?

Chunk 3144 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Don't focus on making money; focu s on protecting what you have.  
Do you still see yourself trading ten or fifteen years down the road? 
I wouldn't have it any other way. 
 
Paul Jones was a winning trader from his start in the business, but, in the early years, his 
performance was volatile. It took a traumati c trading experience to permanently forge the 
importance of risk control into his mind. Since that gut-wrenching cotton trade in 1979, Jones has

Chunk 3145 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
managed to maintain excellent net profita bility, while bringi ng his risk way down. 
Today, risk control is the essence of Jones' trading style and suc cess. He never thinks about what he 
might make on a given trade, but only on what he  could lose. He mentally marks each of his 
positions to the market. No matter how large a prof it he may have in a position, in Jones' mind his 
entry price was the previous night' s close. Since this approach assu res that there is never a cushion

Chunk 3146 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
in his trades, Jones never gets complacent about a ny of his positions. He not only watches the risk 
of each position, but he closely monito rs the performance of his entire portfolio in real-time. If his 
total equity drops 1 to 2 percen t during a single trading session, he might well liquidate all of his 
positions instantaneously to cut his risk. "It is always  easier to get back in than to get out," he says.

Chunk 3147 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
If Jones' trading starts going poorly, he will conti nually reduce his position size until he is on track 
again. That way, when he is trading his worst, he is also  trading his smallest. In any month with net 
trading losses, Jones will automatically reduce his risk exposure to make sure he never registers a  70double-digit loss in a single month. After big winning streaks, he is partic ularly cautious about 
getting overconfident.

Chunk 3148 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
getting overconfident. 
In short, Jones maintains risk control in a dozen di fferent ways. As he puts it, "The most important 
rule in trading is: Play great  defense, not great offense." 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  71Gary Bielfeldt-Yes, They Do Trade T-Bonds in Peoria 
For years, I have heard the name BLH mentione d as one of the major players in the futures 
markets, particularly T-bonds, the world's larg est futures market. I assumed BLH was a huge

Chunk 3149 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trading corporation, but in seeking out the country's  best traders, I discovered that BLH was basi-
cally a single indivi dual: Gary Bielfeldt. 
Who is Gary Bielfeldt? Where did he get the capital to rival the primary Wall Street institutions as 
a major force in the T-bond futures market? Bielfe ldt began his trading car eer twenty-five years 
ago, with a mere $1,000 investment. At first, his capital was so limited he confined himself to

Chunk 3150 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trading a single corn contract—one of the smallest futures contracts at a time  of relative stagnation 
in agricultural prices. From this extremely modest start, Bielfeld t eventually built his account up to 
staggering proportions. 
How did he do it? Bielfeldt does not believe in di versification. His trading philosophy is that you 
pick one area and become expert at it. For much of his trading career, the soybean complex and, to

Chunk 3151 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
a more minor extent, the related grain market s provided that focal point of attention. 
Although Bielfeldt had the desire to become a fu ll-time trader from the beginning, his tiny capital 
base restricted his trading to a part-time endeavor . In those early years, he  earned his living running 
a small brokerage office. The problem he faced was how he, a trader without any independent 
funds, could develop a sufficient capital base to become a profe ssional trader. Bielfeldt's strong

Chunk 3152 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
desire to make this leap in hi s capital base prompted him to take  a large, if not imprudent, risk. 
By 1965, Bielfeldt had painstakingly built up his initial $1,000 stake to $10,000. Based on his 
fundamental evaluation of the soybean market, as well as the concurri ng opinion by his former 
agricultural economics professor, Thomas Hieronymus, Bielfeldt st rongly believed that prices 
would go higher. In an all-or-nothi ng play, he bought twen ty soybean contracts,  an extremely high-

Chunk 3153 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
leverage position given his $10,000 account size. A mere 10-cent price decline would have com-
pletely wiped out his account , while a considerably smaller dec line would have been sufficient to 
generate a forced-liquidation margin call. Initia lly, prices did move lower, and Bielfeldt came 
perilously close to that damaging margin call. But he  held on, and prices eventually reversed to the 
upside. By the time he liquidated the position, he had more than doubled his equity on that single

Chunk 3154 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trade. That trade launch ed Bielfeldt toward his much sought  after goal of becoming a full-time 
trader. 
Bielfeldt built his account with unerring consistency. By the early 1980s, Bielfeldt's trading size 
had grown to the point that government-established speculative position limits in the soybean and 
grain markets were becoming an impediment. This factor, aided by a particularly bad trade in the

Chunk 3155 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
soybean market in 1983, prompted Bielfeldt to sh ift his focus to the T-bond futures market, which 
at the time had no position limit. (Although a positio n limit was eventually implemented in the T-
bond market, the 10,000 contract limit dwarfe d the 600-contract limit in soybeans.) 
The 1983 soybean loss may have been the best thing th at ever happened to Bi elfeldt. His shift to T-
bonds coincided with an evolving major bottom in that market. He became very bullish and built up

Chunk 3156 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
a huge long T-bond position at the right time. Wh en the T-bond market exploded during the mid-
1984 to early 1986 period, Bielfeldt was perfectly posi tioned to garner huge pr ofits. His ability to 
stay with a major position for a lo ng-term move allowed him to leverage his well-timed trade to a 
much greater degree than would have been achie ved by most professional traders with the same 
initial position. This long T-bond position was Bielfe ldt's best trade ever and catapulted him into a

Chunk 3157 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
new echelon. That, in short, is the story of how a one-lot corn trader became a T-bond futures 
trader in the same league as the most prominent institutional market participants. 
Bielfeldt could not be further removed from the popul ar image of a large-scal e trader in the highly 
leveraged sphere of futures trad ing. One would hardly expect to find one of the world's largest bond 
traders in Peoria. Bielfeldt's attach ment to his home town is so st rong that he refused to consider

Chunk 3158 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
becoming a trader on the floor of the Chicago Bo ard of Trade because it would have meant giving 
up his cherished lifestyle. He is the epitome of the small town model American citizen: honest, hard 
working, devoted to family and community. One of Bi elfeldt's major goals has been to plow back a 
portion of his trading-deri ved wealth into projects  benefiting his home town.

Chunk 3159 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I interviewed Bielfeldt in his large, comfor tably furnished office. The huge, wraparound desk  72configuration was flanked by ten quot e screens. Despite this vast ar ray of electronics, Bielfeldt was 
low keyed. He rarely glanced at th e screens during the afte rnoon I spent in his offi ce, and it is hard 
to visualize him trading frantica lly at any time, the vast array of quote machines notwithstanding.

Chunk 3160 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Bielfeldt is a soft-spoken man of few words. He is also a very modest man who consistently 
hesitated talking about his achieve ments, lest it sound like bragging. His very conservative nature 
led him to avoid even seemingly innocuous subjects. For example, at one point in discussing the 
reasons for his net trading losses in a given year, he  asked me to turn off my tape recorder. I could 
hardly imagine what he might say that necessitate d this precautionary measure. The off-the-record

Chunk 3161 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
comments proved far from shocking. It turned out that his trading losses  in that year were 
influenced by an overextension into other commi tments, including his membership on the Chicago 
Board of Trade Board of Directors, a position wh ich required frequent travel to Chicago. Ap-
parently, he was reluctant to be quoted because he did not want to make it seem that he was 
blaming his other responsibilities—w hich he deemed part of his na tural obligations—for his trading 
losses.

Chunk 3162 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
losses. 
The combination of Bielfeldt's laconic nature, mode sty, and conservatism made  this a very difficult 
interview. In fact, this was the only intervie w I conducted in which the average length of the 
questions was longer than the average length of th e responses. I considered deleting the interview 
from the book—a tempting choice since I had an ex cess of material. However, I found Bielfeldt's

Chunk 3163 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
story so compelling and his characte r so strong that I was reluctant to take the easy way out. As a 
compromise, I weighted this chapter to the narrat ive side and limited the interview section to a few 
excerpts. 
What is your basic approach in analyzing and trading the markets? 
I always try to lean primarily on fundamental an alysis. However, since I found it was very difficult 
to know all the fundamentals—usually you are doi ng pretty well if you ha ve 80 percent of the

Chunk 3164 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
pieces—I thought it was important to have someth ing to fall back on in case my fundamental 
analysis was wrong. 
I assume you are referring to technical analysis as a supplement. 
Right. I developed my own trend-following system.  
Do you trade this system in any consistent way? 
I use the system primarily as a backup to  tell me when to get out of a position. 
Can you think of an example? 
At the start of 1988,1 was long the bond market primarily because I was expecting a weaker

Chunk 3165 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
economy. Everything seemed to be on target un til early March when the bond market started 
edging down. At some point, you have to say you ar e wrong. In this case, my system provided me 
with the rationale for getti ng out of my losing position. 
What went wrong with that trade? 
Basically, the economy was a lot stronger than I ha d anticipated. I thought that there would be a 
bigger fear factor left over fr om the October 1987 stock market crash than actually materialized.

Chunk 3166 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
What is your opinion of trend-following systems? 
The best thing anyone can do when starting out is to learn how a trend system works. Trading a 
trend system for a while will teach a new trader th e principle of letting profits run and cutting losses 
short. If you can just learn di scipline by using a trend-following system, even temporarily, it will 
increase your odds of being successful as a trader. 
Do you have an opinion about systems sold to the public?

Chunk 3167 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I looked at some of these systems a few years a go and found that they generally made too many 
trades. If a system trades too fr equently, the transaction costs will  be too high, a factor that will 
significantly reduce the probability of  the system working. I think to be viable, a trend-following 
system has to be medium to longer term. The more sensitive systems just generate too much 
commission.

Chunk 3168 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
commission. 
Besides providing a training vehicle for learning  good trading habits, do you feel that trend- 73following systems can provide an effective trading approach? 
I would advise anyone who develops  a system to combine it with  their own judgment. In other 
words, they should trade half the money on a syst em and the other half using their own judgment, 
just in case the system isn't working. 
Is that the way you trade?

Chunk 3169 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Is that the way you trade? 
I used to pay more attention to  systems than I do now. Basically, I just focus on my own judgment. 
Is that because your own judgment is more relia ble, or because systems haven't been working 
as well as they used to? 
They haven't worked as well as they used to  because there are too many people using them. 
Whenever too many people are doing the same th ing, the market will go through a period of 
adjustment.

Chunk 3170 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
adjustment. 
What are the key factors you focus on in f undamentally evaluating the T-bond market? 
The economy is definitely the single most impor tant factor. Four other important elements are 
inflation expectations, the dollar, the trade balance, and the budget deficit. 
You have been trading for over twenty-five ye ars—a much longer time period than most 
other traders. Is there any single trade that stands out as the most dramatic?

Chunk 3171 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
There are quite a few trades that  would qualify as dramatic, but the one that stands out most 
prominently was my attempt to pick the bottom of the bond market in 1983 and 1984. 
When did you start trying to buy the bonds? 
I started trying to pick a bottom when th e bonds were trading in the 63-66 area. 
How much risk did you allow when putting on a trade? 
Generally anywhere from \ to ГА points. [One point in T-bond future s is equal to 32 ticks. A 1-point

Chunk 3172 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
move is equal to $1,000 per contract.] 
So if you tried to pick a spot  that looked good and it didn't  work, you would bail out and try 
again at another spot? 
Right. 
Since bonds eventually declined into the 50s, I guess you must have had a few strikes against 
you before you finally went long in the right place. 
Yes, there were several lo sses over a period of time. 
Do you remember when you finally got positioned  at a point where you didn't have to get 
out?

Chunk 3173 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
out? 
I turned really bullish in May 1984, when they au ctioned off five-year notes at a 13.93 yield. I had 
been involved in banking since 1974, and at the time, we couldn't find any qualified borrowers for 
three-year loans at 13 percent. Ye t here were government five-year notes selling at nearly a full 
percentage point above that level. Moreover, this was at a time when we were at the height of a

Chunk 3174 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
recession in Peoria: Unemployment was approachi ng 20 percent and the farm crisis was worsening. 
I felt that interest rates had probably gone high enough. From that point on through April 1986,1 
traded T-bonds heavily from the long side. There is no question that that was my best trade and 
longest trend ever. 
What are the elements of good trading? 
The most important thing is to have a method for staying with your winners and getting rid of your 
losers.

Chunk 3175 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
losers. 
What do you do to make  sure that you stay with a winning position to exploit the longer-term 
trend? How do you avoid the temptati on of taking profits prematurely? 
The best way I know to learn discipline and pati ence is to think through a trade thoroughly before 
putting it on. You need to develop a plan of your st rategies for various con tingencies. That way, 
you won't get swayed by every news item that hits the market and causes pr ices to move up or

Chunk 3176 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
down. Also, it helps greatly to have a long-term objective that you have derived by really doing 
your homework. You combine that long-term objective with a protective stop th at you move as the  74position goes your way. Alternatively, you could use a trend-following system to signal when you 
should get out of the trade. By having thought out  your objective and having a strategy for getting

Chunk 3177 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
out in case the market trend changes, you greatly in crease the potential for staying in your winning 
positions. 
Why do most traders lose? 
They overtrade, which means that they have to  be right a lot just to cover commissions. 
What are the traits of a successful trader? 
The most important is disciplin e—I am sure everyone tells you that. Second, you have to have 
patience; if you have a good trade on, you have to be  able to stay with it.  Third, you need courage

Chunk 3178 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to go into the market, and courage comes from adequate capitalization. Fourth, you must have a 
willingness to lose; that is also related to adequate capitalization. Fifth, you need a strong desire to 
win. 
Those elements seem fairly straightforward,  except for the willingness to lose. Can you 
expound on that? 
You should have the attitude that if a trade lo ses, you can handle it without any problem and come 
back to do the next trade. You can't le t a losing trade get to you emotionally.

Chunk 3179 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Can you talk more about what you mean by courage? 
If a 260-pound fullback is running through the line and a 175-pound linebacker has to stop him, he 
has to have the courage to go into him. You need th at kind of courage to be able to participate in 
the markets. If everyone is bullish  the dollar, and the yen is sharpl y lower, it takes courage to fade 
that major consensus and buy the yen. 
How do you judge success?

Chunk 3180 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How do you judge success? 
Most people will judge success by how well they do in their field. A teacher would judge success 
by how well the students do and how they go thr ough life. A trader would probably judge success 
by whether he wins or loses in the market. 
Speaking personally, how do you judge success'. 
I judge success by what I do with the money I accumu late. One of the things that my wife and I

Chunk 3181 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
have done is to establish a foundation so that we could share some of our success with the 
community by supporting various programs. 
Is this foundation one that you just fund, or do you have a hands-on relationship in running 
it? 
My family and I are directly involved in evalua ting different projects and deciding which ones to 
fund. 
When did you set up this foundation? 
In 1985. But I had thought about the idea as far back as the early 1970s. I had always planned that

Chunk 3182 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
if I were to become successful, I would set up a foundation to help the community. 
Do you think this long-term goal was an impo rtant motivation leading to your success as a 
trader? 
Yes, I think it helped. 
What advice do you have for the beginning trader? 
When you are starting out, it is very important not to get too far behind becau se it is very difficult 
to fight back. Most traders have a tendency to take risk s that are too large at  the beginning. They

Chunk 3183 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
tend not to be selective enough a bout when they take risks. 
At this point, Bielfeldt asked me to turn off the tape recorder. He talked about the relevance and 
application of poker strategy to trading. His reason for keeping th e comments off-the-record was 
that he didn't want to contribute to the image of  trading as a form of gambling. I found his analogy 
particularly apropos and finally pe rsuaded him to put it on the record. 
Could you explain your analogy between trading and poker?

Chunk 3184 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I learned how to play poker at a very young age. My fa ther taught me the c oncept of playing the  75percentage hands. You don't just play every ha nd and stay through every card, because if you do, 
you will have a much higher probability of losing. You should play the good hands, and drop out of 
the poor hands, forfeiting the ante. When more of  the cards are on the table and you have a very 
strong hand—in other words, when you feel the percentages are skewed in your favor—you raise

Chunk 3185 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
and play that hand to the hilt. 
If you apply the same principles of poker strate gy to trading, it increa ses your odds of winning 
significantly. I have always tried to keep the c oncept of patience in mind by waiting for the right 
trade, just like you wait for the pe rcentage hand in poker. If a tr ade doesn't look right, you get out 
and take a small loss; it's precisely equivalent to  forfeiting the ante by dropping out of a poor hand

Chunk 3186 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
in poker. On the other hand, when the percentages seem to be strongly in  your favor, you should be 
aggressive and really try to leverage the trad e similar to the way you raise on the good hands in 
poker. 
Bielfeldt's story provides an inspiring example of what is attainable give n patience on the one hand 
and an aggressive trading style on the other. Here  is an individual who, starting with a minuscule

Chunk 3187 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
amount of money, working independently, and without  benefit of staff or elaborate technology, 
became one of the world's most successful traders.  Moreover, because of his long-term goals and 
actions, his ultimate success positivel y impacted an entire community. 
The portion of Gary Bielfeldt' s interview that I f ound most insightful was his analogy between 
poker and trading. It is also interesting to comp are Bielfeldt's key point in this analogy to the

Chunk 3188 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
similar advice offered by James Rogers: Have the pa tience to wait for the ri ght trade to come along. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  76Ed Seykota-Everybody Gets What They Want 
Although completely unknown, not only to the public, but to most of the fi nancial community as 
well, Ed Seykota's achievements must certainly rank hi m as one of the best traders of our time. In 
the early 1970s, Seykota was hired by a major broke rage firm. He conceived and developed the

Chunk 3189 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
first commercial computerized trading system for managing clients' money in the futures markets. 
His system proved quite profitable, but in terference and second-gue ssing by management 
significantly impeded its performance. This experi ence provided the catalyst for Seykota going out 
on his own. 
In the ensuing years, Seykota app lied his systematized approach to  trading a handful of accounts 
and his own money. During that period, the accounts Seykota managed have witnessed an

Chunk 3190 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
absolutely astounding rate of return. For example,  as of mid-1988, one of his customer accounts, 
which started with $5,000 in 1972, was up ove r 250,000 percent on a cash-on-cash basis. 
(Normalized for withdrawals, the account theore tically was up several million percent.) I know of 
no other trader who has matc hed this track record over the same length of time. 
I had never heard of Seykota wh en I first began working on this  book. Seykota's name had come up

Chunk 3191 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
several times during my interview of Michael Marc us as the person who was most influential in 
transforming him into a successful trader. Afte r our interview, Marcus  said reflectively, "You 
know, you really should interview Ed Seykota. He is not only a great trader; he is a mind." 
Marcus provided an introduction over the phone, a nd I briefly outlined the concept of my book to 
Seykota. Since I was already out We st, it was most convenient for me to interview Seykota on the

Chunk 3192 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
same trip by rerouting my return to New York via Reno. Seykota was agreea ble to participating, 
but seemed skeptical of my ability to complete th e inter-vie w in the space of two hours (the time 
available in order for me to make my flight c onnections). I assured him that, although it was tight, I 
had done a few other interviews in that space of time. "It is feasible as long as our conversation 
remains very focused," I explained.

Chunk 3193 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
remains very focused," I explained. 
I cut my arrival at the airport extremely close, ha ving forgotten to revise my ticket to reflect the 
change in itinerary. After a voci ferous argument with a ticket ag ent who insisted I didn't have 
enough time to catch my flight—a contention she n early made self-fulfilling—I raced through the 
airport, reaching the gate with only seconds to spare. By the time I arrived in Reno, the tension

Chunk 3194 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
from my near-missed flight had just about dissip ated. The drive to Seykota's house was too far for a 
cab, so I rented a car. It was very early morning, and the high way winding up into the mountains 
offered spectacular vistas below. The classica l music station I found on the radio was playing 
Mozart's Clarinet Concerto. The combination was glorious. 
Seykota works from an office in his house, wh ich borders Lake Tahoe. Before beginning the

Chunk 3195 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
interview, we took a brief walk out onto the beac h behind his house. It was a cold, clear morning, 
and the view was idyllic. The contrast between  his workplace and my own—an office in the Wall 
Street area, with a prominent vi ew of an ugly building—could hard ly have been more striking. I 
plead guilty to jealousy. 
In contrast to virtually all the other traders I had interviewed, Seykot a's desk is not flanked by an

Chunk 3196 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
array of quote screens, or, for th at matter, even a single screen. Hi s trading is largely confined to 
the few minutes it takes to run his computer program which gene rates signals for the next day. 
In my conversation with Seykot a, I was struck by the intensity of both his intelligence and 
sensitivity—an odd combination I thought. He has a way of looking at things from a unique 
vantage point. At one moment, he could be talki ng about analytical techni ques and would appear as

Chunk 3197 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the consummate scientist (he holds a degree in electrical engineering fr om MIT), bringing up a 
three-dimensional diagram on the computer scr een, generated by one of the many programs he had 
designed. Yet, in another moment, when the conversation turned to the psychology of trading, he 
would reveal great sensitivity a nd insight into human behavior. 
Indeed, in recent years, Seykota has become very involved in the field of psychology. It appeared

Chunk 3198 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to me that psychology, and its application in help ing people solve their problems, had become a 
more important element in his lif e than market analysis and trad ing. I suspect that Seykota would 
probably find this contrast somewhat artificial, in  that to him, trading and psychology are one and 
the same thing.  77Our conversation was not as focused as I had inte nded it to be. In fact, it went off in so many

Chunk 3199 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
directions that we had barely scratched th e surface by the time the two hours had elapsed. I 
continued on, assuming that I would merely catch a la ter flight. As it turned out , the flight that I had 
missed was the last direct one from Reno to New York. 
Seykota later told me that  he knew in our first phone conversatio n that I would end up spending the 
day. He is extremely perceptive about people. Fo r example, at one point in our conversation,

Chunk 3200 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Seykota asked me, "How many minutes fast do  you set your watch?" I found this question 
particularly striking in that in our brief time toge ther, he had been able to pick up on one of my 
basic character traits. The question was also partic ularly timely, given my ne ar-missed flight earlier 
that morning. 
Seykota's success goes well beyond his trading. He  impressed me as someone who had found 
meaning in his life, and was living exactly  the life he want ed to be living.

Chunk 3201 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How did you first get involved in trading? 
In the late 1960s, I decided that silver had to rise when the U. S. Treasury stopped selling it. I 
opened a commodity margin account to take full a dvantage of my insight. While I was waiting, my 
broker convinced me to short some copper. I s oon got stopped out and lost some money and my 
trading virginity. So I went back to waiting for the start of the big, inevitable bull market in silver.

Chunk 3202 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Finally, the day arrived. I bought. Much to my amazeme nt and financial detriment, the price started 
falling! 
At first it seemed impossible to me that silver could fall on such a bullish deal. Yet the price was 
falling and that was a fact. Soon my stop got hit. This was a very stunning education about the way 
markets discount news. I became more and more fascinated with how markets work. 
About that time, I saw a letter published by Richard Donchian, which implied that a purely

Chunk 3203 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
mechanical trend-following system could beat the markets. This too seemed impossible to me. So I 
wrote computer programs (on punch cards in t hose days) to test the theories. Amazingly, his 
theories tested true. To this day, I'm not sure  I understand why or whether I really need to. 
Anyhow, studying the markets, and backing up my  opinions with money, was so fascinating 
compared to my other career oppo rtunities at the time, that I be gan trading full time for a living.

Chunk 3204 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
What was your first trading-related job? 
I landed my first job on Wall Street in the early 1 970s as an analyst with a major brokerage house. I 
was assigned to cover the egg and broiler markets. [Broilers are young ch ickens up to 2'<i pounds 
dressed weight. The futures markets for both broile rs and eggs have since disappeared as waning 
trading activity prompted their delisting by the pa rent exchanges.] I found it interesting that an

Chunk 3205 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
entry level guy like me was immediately placed in charge of dispensing tr ading advice. I once 
wrote an article recommending that traders stay away from the market for a while. Management 
censored that comment from the ma rket letter— likely because it didn't promise to motivate much 
trading. 
I wanted to start applying computers to the bus iness of analysis. Remember, in those days 
computers were still typically punch card devi ces used for accounting. The guy who was running

Chunk 3206 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the computer department seemed to see me as a thr eat to his job security, a nd he repeatedly chased 
me off his turf. After about a m onth at that job, I announced that I was going to quit. The head of 
the department called me in to fi nd out why. It was the first time he  had ever been interested in 
talking to me. 
I went to work for another brokerage house, wh ich was going through a re organization. There was

Chunk 3207 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
a lot less management, so I took advantage of the lack of supervision by using the accounting 
computer to test trading systems during the w eekends. They had an IBM 360 which took up a large 
air conditioned room. Over the cour se of about a half year, I wa s able to test  about a hundred 
variations of four simple systems for about ten years of data on ten commodities. Today, the same 
job takes about one day on a PC. A nyway, I got my results. They co nfirmed there was a possibility

Chunk 3208 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
of making money from trend-following systems. 
I take it that computer testing of systems wa s not part of your job,  since you did it on 
weekends. What were you actually hired to do? 
During the week, my normal Clark Kent type job wa s to load new rolls of paper onto the Reuters  78machine when the margin turned pink. I was also re sponsible for tearing off the news in strips and 
hanging them up on the wall behind the machine. The trick was to tear between line-feeds so as to

Chunk 3209 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
get a smooth edge. The funny thing was that hardly anyone would read the news since they'd have 
to lean way over the machine to see the pages. So I started reading the news and personally 
delivering it to the brokers. One bonus of this job wa s that I got to observe a lot of brokers' trading 
styles. 
Your official position sounds like a glorified office boy. Why did you accept such a menial 
job?

Chunk 3210 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
job? 
Because I knew I wanted to be in the business, and I didn't care what I did, or what I got paid. 
Why didn't you stay at your original positi on? At least there you were an analyst. 
Because it was a stultifying environment. I di sapproved of management pressures to recommend 
trades when I thought there were no trading opport unities. Also, I saw that being allowed access to 
the company computers for testing trading sy stems (my real desire) was a dead issue.

Chunk 3211 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Did you know that you could have a ccess to the computer at your new job? 
No, but since the company had just gone through a major shake-up and most of the management 
had been fired, I figured there woul dn't be very much of a bureaucr acy to interfere with my use of 
the computer. 
What became of your work on computerized trading systems? 
Eventually, management got interested in us ing my research results  for managing money. I

Chunk 3212 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
developed the first large-scale comme rcial computerized trading system. 
What do you mean by large scale? 
The program was marketed by se veral hundred agents  of the firm, and the equity under 
management was several million dollars—a large amount of money in the early 1970s. 
How did you get management to support you to that extent? 
They were familiar with Richard Donchian, w ho was a pioneer in deve loping trend-following

Chunk 3213 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trading systems, although, at the time, he was do ing everything by hand. Because of that exposure, 
they were already favorably disposed to the con cept of using trading syst ems to manage money. 
Also, at the time, computers were so new that "computer system" was a great buzzword. 
How did your trading program do? 
The program did fine; the problem  was that management couldn't keep from second-guessing the

Chunk 3214 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
signals. For example, I remember one time the program generated a buy signal for sugar when it 
was trading around 5 cents. Mana gement thought that the mark et was already overbought and 
decided not to take the signal. When the market kept on going higher, they  came up with the rule 
that they would buy on the first 20- point pullback [ 100 points equal 1 cent]. When no such 
pullback developed, they modified the rule  to buying on the firs t 30-point reaction.

Chunk 3215 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
As the market kept moving higher without any mean ingful retracements, they  changed th e rule to 
50 points and eventually 100 points.  Finally, with sugar prices ar ound 9 cents, they finally decided 
that it was a bull market, and that they had better buy before prices went much higher. They put the 
managed accounts long at that point. As you might guess, the sugar market peaked shortly 
thereafter. They compounded the error by ignoring the sell signal as well—a signal which also

Chunk 3216 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
would have been very profitable. 
The bottom line was that because of this interference, the most profita ble trade of the year ended up 
losing money. As a result, instead of a theoretical return of 60 percent for the year, quite a few 
accounts actually lost money. This type of meddling was one of the main reasons w hy I eventually 
quit. 
What were the other reasons? 
Management wanted me to change the system so that it would trade more actively, thereby

Chunk 3217 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
generating more commission income. I explained to th em that it would be very easy to make such a 
change, but doing so would seriously impede performance. They didn't seem to care. 
What did you do after you quit?  79I just quit the research department, but I stayed  on as a broker managing accounts. After about two 
years, I gave up brokerage to become a money mana ger. That shift allowed me to get away from

Chunk 3218 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
earning my living from commissions, which I think can be a counterproductive incentive to making 
money for clients. I switched to a pure profit incentiv e fee arrangement. 
Did you continue trading the system after you left? 
Yes, although I substantially revise d the system over the years.  
What is the performance track record? 
I do not publicize my track record  other than my "model account," which is an actual customer

Chunk 3219 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
account that started with $5,000 in 1972 and has ma de over $15 million. Theoretically, the total 
return would have been many multiples larger had there been no withdrawals. 
With performance like that, how come you haven't been deluged with word-of-mouth 
requests to manage money? 
I do receive requests, but I very rarely accept new accounts. If I do, it is only after considerable 
interviewing and screening to de termine the motivations and attit udes of the client. I have found

Chunk 3220 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that the people I associate with have subtle, yet very important, effects on my performance. If, for 
example, they are able to support me and my met hods over the long term, then they tend to help 
me. If, however, they get too concerned with th e short-term ups and downs of their account, they 
can be a hindrance. 
How many accounts did you originally start out with? 
About a half dozen back in the early 1970s.  
How many of those accounts are still with you?

Chunk 3221 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How many of those accounts are still with you? 
Four. One client made about $15 million and d ecided to withdraw his money and manage it 
himself; another made over $10 million and de cided to buy a house on the beach and retire. 
What source did you learn from before designing your first system? 
I was inspired and influenced by the book Reminiscences of a Stock Operator and also by Richard 
Donchian's five- and twenty-day moving average cr ossover system and his weekly rule system. I

Chunk 3222 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
consider Donchian to be one of th e guiding lights of technical trading. 
What was your first trading system? 
My first system was a variation of Donchian's  moving average system. I used an exponential 
averaging method because it was easier to calculat e and computational errors tended to disappear 
over time. It was so new at the time that it was being passed around by word of mouth as the 
"expedential system."

Chunk 3223 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
"expedential system." 
Your reference to a first system  implies that you eventually changed systems. How did you 
know when your system n eeded to be changed? 
Systems don't need to be changed. The trick is for a trader to develop a system with which he is 
compatible. 
Were you incompatible with your original system? 
My original system was very simple with hard-and- fast rules that didn't a llow for any deviations. I

Chunk 3224 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
found it difficult to stay with the system while di sregarding my own feelings. I kept jumping on and 
off—often at just the wrong time. I thought I knew  better than the system. At the time, I didn't 
really trust that trend-following systems would work. There is plen ty of literature "proving" they 
don't. Also, it seemed a waste of my intellect and MIT education to  just sit there and not try to

Chunk 3225 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
figure out the markets. Eventuall y, as I became more confident of trading with the trend, and more 
able to ignore the news, I became more comfortable with the approach. Also, as I continued to 
incorporate more "expert trader rules," my system  became more compatible with my trading style. 
What is your trading style? 
My style is basically trend following, with some special pattern recognition and money 
management algorithms.

Chunk 3226 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
management algorithms. 
Without divulging trade secrets, how have you been able to so spectacularly outperform  80standard trend-following systems? 
The key to long-term survival and prosperity  has a lot to do with the money management 
techniques incorporated into the technical system . There are old traders a nd there are bold traders, 
but there are very few old, bold traders. 
Witty and true, but the question remains, albeit  in translated form: There are many trend-

Chunk 3227 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
following systems with money management ru les; why have you done so much better? 
I seem to have a gift. I think it is related to my  overall philosophy, which has a lot to do with loving 
the markets and maintaining an optimistic attitude. Also, as I keep trading and learning, my system 
(that is the mechanical computer version of what  I do) keeps evolving. I would add that I consider 
myself and how I do things as a kind of system which, by definiti on, I always follow. Sometimes I

Chunk 3228 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trade entirely off the m echanical part, sometimes I override the signals based on strong feelings, 
and sometimes I just quit altogether. The immedi ate trading result of this jumping around is 
probably breakeven to somewhat negative. Howeve r, if I didn't allow myself the freedom to 
discharge my creative side, it might build up to so me kind of blowout. Striking a workable ecology 
seems to promote trading longevit y, which is one key to success.

Chunk 3229 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How would you compare the relative ad vantages and disadvantages of systems trading versus 
discretionary trading?  
Systems trading is ultimately discretionary. The manager still has to deci de how much risk to 
accept, which markets to play, and how aggressively to increase and decrease the trading base as a 
function of equity change. Thes e decisions are quite important—of ten more important than trade 
timing.

Chunk 3230 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
timing. 
What percentage of your trading is systems ba sed? Has this percentage changed over time? 
Over time, I have become more mechanical, since (1)1 have become more trusting of trend trading, 
and (2) my mechanical programs have factored in more and more "tricks of the trade." I still go 
through periods of thinking I can outperform my ow n system, but such excursions are often self-
correcting through the pr ocess of losing money.

Chunk 3231 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
correcting through the pr ocess of losing money. 
What are the present and future prospects for trend-following systems? Do you think the 
growing prevalence of their use will doom them to eventual failure? 
No. All trading is done on some so rt of system, whether or not it is conscious. Many of the good 
systems are based on following trends. Life itself is based on trends. Birds start south for the winter

Chunk 3232 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
and keep on going. Companies track trends and a lter their products acco rdingly. Tiny protozoa 
move in trends along chemical and luminescence gradients. 
The profitability of trading systems seems to move  in cycles. Periods during which trend-following 
systems are highly successful will le ad to their increased popularity. As the number of system users 
increases, and the markets shift from trending to  directionless price acti on, these systems become

Chunk 3233 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
unprofitable, and undercapitalized a nd inexperienced traders will get shaken out. Longevity is the 
key to success. 
What are your thoughts about using fundame ntal analysis as an input in trading? 
Fundamentals that you read about are typically useless as the market has already discounted the 
price, and I call them "funny-mentals." However, if  you catch on early, before others believe, then 
you might have valuable "surprise-a-mentals."

Chunk 3234 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
you might have valuable "surprise-a-mentals." 
Your answer is a bit facetious. Does it imply that you only use technical analysis? 
I am primarily a trend trader with touches of hunc hes based on about twenty years of experience. In 
order of importance to me are: (1 ) the long-term trend, (2 ) the current chart pa ttern, and (3) picking 
a good spot to buy or sell. Thos e are the three primary component s of my trading. Way down in

Chunk 3235 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
very distant fourth place are my fundamental ideas and, quite likely, on balance, they have cost me 
money. 
By picking the right spot to buy, do you mean determining a reaction point at which you will 
buy? If so, how do you avoid someti mes missing majo r price moves? 
Oh no. If I were buying, my point would be above th e market. I try to identify a point at which I

Chunk 3236 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
expect the market momentum to be  strong in the direction of the tr ade, so as to reduce my probable  81risk. I don't try to pick a bottom or top. 
Does that imply that if you are bullish, you will always wait for short-term strength before 
entering a position, or will you sometimes buy on a reaction? 
If I am bullish, I neither buy on a reaction, nor wait fo r strength; I am already in. I turn bullish at

Chunk 3237 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the instant my buy stop is hit, and stay bullish un til my sell stop is hit. Being bullish and not being 
long is illogical. 
Do you ever use contrary opinion as an aid to your trading? 
Sometimes. For example, at a recent goldbug conferen ce, virtually all the speakers were bearish. I 
said to myself, "Gold is probably near a botto m." [The market did indeed rally after that 
conference.] 
Would you buy because of that type of input?

Chunk 3238 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Would you buy because of that type of input? 
Oh no, the trend was still down. But it might get me to lighten up my short position. 
What was your most dramatic or  emotional trading experience? 
Dramatic and emotional trading experiences tend to be  negative. Pride is a great banana peel, as are 
hope, fear, and greed. My biggest slip-ups occurred shortly after I got emotionally involved with 
positions. 
How about some actual "war stories"?

Chunk 3239 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
positions. 
How about some actual "war stories"? 
I prefer not to dwell on past situa tions. I tend to cut bad trades as soon as possible, forget them, and 
then move on to new opportunities.  After I bury a dead trade, I don't like to dig up the details 
again—at least not in print. Maybe some evening, after dinner, sitting around a fire, off the record, 
deep in the Tahoe winter... 
Can you describe specific trading mistakes that you learned from?

Chunk 3240 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I had a "thing" for silver for years. One of my firs t losses was in silver, as were many of my worst 
losses. It seemed to get into my blood and hypnotize me. It inveigled me to pull my protective stops 
so as to avoid getting bear-rai ded. Naturally, it would hold moment arily and then collapse some 
more. I got killed so many times by silver spikes  that I started thinking I was some kind of 
werewolf. I worked on myself with  hypnosis and positive imagery. I al so avoided walks in the full

Chunk 3241 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
moon. So far it seems to be working. 
How do you pick your trades? 
Mostly by my trading system, although occasionally, I will get an impulsive flash and override my 
system. Fortunately, I don't usually take on a big enough position to do any lasting damage to my 
portfolio. 
What are the elements of good trading? 
The elements of good trading are: (1) cutting losses, (2) cutting losses, and (3 ) cutting losses. If you 
can follow these three rules, you may have a chance.

Chunk 3242 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How do you handle a losing streak? 
I handle losing streaks by tr imming down my activity. I just wait it out. Trying to  trade during a 
losing streak is emotionally devastating. Trying to play "catch up" is lethal. 
Since you are primarily a systems trader, woul dn't following a system imply no changes of 
trading activity during losing periods? 
I have incorporated some logic in to my computer programs, such as  modulating the trading activity

Chunk 3243 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
depending on market behavior. Still, important deci sions need to be made outside the mechanical 
system boundaries , such as how to maintain diversification for a growing account when some 
positions are at position limit or when markets are too thin. 
Psychologically, I tend to alter my activity dependi ng on performance. I tend to be more aggressive 
after I have been winning, and less so after losses. These tendencies seem OK. In contrast, a costly

Chunk 3244 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
tendency is to get emotional over a loss and then try to get even with an  overly large position. 
Are you a self-taught trader, or did anot her trader teach you worthwhile lessons? 
I am a self-taught trader who is continua lly studying both myself and other traders.  82Do you decide where you are getting ou t before you get in on a trade? 
I set protective stops at the same time I enter a tr ade. I normally move these stops in to lock in a

Chunk 3245 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
profit as the trend continues. Sometimes, I take profits when a market gets wild. This usually 
doesn't get me out any better than waiting for my  stops to close in, but it does cut down on the 
volatility of the por tfolio, which helps calm my nerves. Losi ng a position is a ggravating, whereas 
losing your nerve is devastating. 
What is the maximum percentage of equity  you will risk on any individual trade?

Chunk 3246 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I intend to risk below 5 percent on a trade, allo wing for poor executions. Occasionally I have taken 
losses above that amount when major news caused a thin market to jump through my stops. 
What was your single worst "thin market" loss? 
All markets are too thin when I wa nt to get out of a ba d position in a hurry. Mo st markets have, on 
occasion, moved rapidly against me due to surpri se news. As soon as the news is digested, the

Chunk 3247 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
market thickens up again at a new level. During the big sugar bull market when prices moved from 
10 cents to 40 cents, I was carrying thousa nds of contracts and I gave up several cents getting out of 
my position. [Each cent in sugar is equivalent to $1,120 per contract.] 
Very few traders have enjoyed the spectacular  success you have. What makes you different? 
I feel my success comes from my love of the markets.  I am not a casual trader. It is my life. I have a

Chunk 3248 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
passion for trading. It is not me rely a hobby or even a career choice for me. There is no question 
that this is what I am supposed to do with my life. 
What are the trading rules you live by? 
a. Cut losses. 
b. Ride winners. 
c. Keep bets small. 
d. Follow the rules without question. 
e. Know when to break the rules. 
Your last two rules are cute because they ar e contradictory. Seriously now, which do you 
believe: Follow the rules, or know when to break the rules?

Chunk 3249 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I believe both. Mostly I follow the rales. As I keep studying the markets, I sometimes find a new 
rale which breaks and then replaces a previous ra le. Sometimes I get to a personal breakpoint. 
When that happens, I just get out of the markets a ltogether and take a vacati on until I feel that I am 
ready to follow the rales again. Perhaps some day, I will have a more explicit rale for breaking 
rales.

Chunk 3250 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
rales. 
I don't think traders can follow rales for very l ong unless they reflect th eir own trading style. 
Eventually, a breaking point is r eached and the trader has to quit or change, or find a new set of 
rales he can follow. This seems to be part of the process of evolution and growth of a trader. 
How important to trading success is varying the size of the bet? 
It might be a good idea depending on the reas on for doing so. Consider, though, if you had a

Chunk 3251 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
successful modification policy, say "M" for changing system "S," then you might be better off just 
trading "M." 
How important is gut feel? 
Gut feel is important. If ignored, it may come out in subtle ways by coloring your logic. It can be 
dealt with through meditation and re flection to determine what's behi nd it. If it pers ists, then it 
might be a valuable subconscious analysis of some subtle information. Otherwise, it might be a

Chunk 3252 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
dangerous sublimation of an inner desire for ex citement and! not reflect market conditions. Be 
sensitive to the subtle differences be tween "intuition" and "into wishing." 
What was your worst year? What went wrong? 
One of my worst years was 1980. The bull markets ha d ended, but I kept tryi ng to hold on and buy 
back in at lower prices. The markets just kept on  breaking. I had never s een a major bear market 
before, so I was all set up for an  important educational experience.

Chunk 3253 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
What happened to the money management ru les in your system in 1980? Did you override  83them? 
I continued to trade even though my system was la rgely out of the markets due to the enormous 
volatility. I tried to pick tops and bottom is in  what I considered grossly overbought and oversold 
markets. The markets just kept on going and I lo st a lot. Eventually, I saw the futility of my 
approach and quit for a while. 
What is the most important advice  you can give the average trader?

Chunk 3254 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
That he should find a superior trader to do his trad ing for him, and then go find something he really 
loves to do. 
Do you believe chart reading can be used for successful trading? 
I consider trend following to be a subset of char ting. Charting is a little like surfing. You don't have 
to know a lot about the physics of tides, resonan ce, and fluid dynamics in  order to catch a good 
wave. You just have to be able to sense when it's  happening and then have the drive to act at the

Chunk 3255 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
right time. 
What was your personal experience in October 1987? 
I made money on the day of the October 1987 crash. I also made money for the month as a whole, 
and for the year, as well. I lost on the day after the crash, however, since I was short the interest 
rate markets. Most trend traders were likely either  out or short stocks a nd stock indexes during the 
crash. 
Are the markets different now th an they were five to ten ye ars ago because of the much

Chunk 3256 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
greater current participation by professional managers? 
No. The markets are the same now as they were five to ten years ago because they keep changing—
just like they did then. 
Does trading become more difficult as your size increases? 
It becomes more difficult because it is harder to  move large positions without moving the market. It 
becomes easier because you have more acc ess to competent people to support you. 
What type of support do you mean?

Chunk 3257 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
What type of support do you mean? 
A team of experienced brokers wi th professional attitudes. E xperienced' traders can be very 
supportive by just being there for sharing joys and so rrows. Also, the old-timers seem to be able to 
smell the beginnings and endings of major moves. I al so receive important  support from my 
friends, associates, and family. 
Do you use any outside advisory services?

Chunk 3258 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Do you use any outside advisory services? 
I keep track of a lot of outside advisers, mostly by reading the bus iness press or hearing from my 
brokers. The services usually break even, except wh en they start to gloat, then they are likely 
headed for trouble. 
How about market letters? 
Market letters tend to lag behind the market since they generally respond to demand for news about 
recent activity. Although there are ce rtainly important exceptions, lette r writing is often a beginning

Chunk 3259 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
job in the industry, and as such may be handled  by inexperienced trader s or non-traders. Good 
traders trade. Good letter writers write letters. 
Do you use the opinions of other traders in making trading decisions, or do you operate 
completely solo? 
I usually ignore advice from other traders, especi ally the ones who believ e they are on to a "sure 
thing." The old-timers, who talk about "maybe ther e is a chance of so and so," are often right and 
early.

Chunk 3260 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
early. 
At what point did you get the confidence that  you could keep on winning as a trader? 
I vacillate between (a) "I can keep on winning," a nd (b) "I have just been lucky." I sometimes get 
most confident of my ability just before a major losing streak. 
How similar are the price pa tterns in different markets?

Chunk 3261 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Common patterns transcend individu al market behavior. For exampl e, bond prices have a lot in  84common with the way cockroaches crawl up and down a wall. Unfortunately for cockroach 
followers, there is usually no one around to take the other side of a trade. 
Does the stock market behave differently from other markets? 
The stock market behaves differently from all ot her markets and it also behaves differently from

Chunk 3262 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the stock market. If this is hard to understand, it is because trying to understand the markets is a bit 
futile. I don't think it makes any more sense trying to understand the stock market than trying to 
understand music. A lot of people would rather  understand the market  than make money. 
What do you mean, "The stock market be haves differently from the stock market"? 
The stock market behaves differently from itself in  that easily identifiable patterns seldom exactly 
repeat.

Chunk 3263 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
repeat. 
What is your long-term outlook for inflation, the dollar, and gold? 
Inflation is part of the way societies sweep away  the old order. All currencies eventually get 
debased—like it or not. Compute one penny invest ed at the time of Christ, compounded at 3 
percent per year. Then consider why nobody has anywhere near that amount these days. 
Gold tends to be dug up, refined, and then buried again. The geographical en tropy of all gold on the

Chunk 3264 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
planet seems to decrease over time. A lot has been  collected in vaults. I project the trend as one 
toward a central world gold stash. 
Do great traders have a special talent for trading? 
Good traders have a special talent for trading just  as good musicians and good athletes have talents 
for their fields. Great traders are ones who are ab sorbed by the talent. They don't have the talent—
the talent has them. 
What is the balance between talent versus work in trading success?

Chunk 3265 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I don't know where one starts and the other stops. 
How much of a role does lu ck play in trading success? 
Luck plays an enormous role in  trading success. Some people we re lucky enough to be born smart, 
while others were even smarter and got born lucky. 
How about a serious answer? 
"Luck" or "smarts" or "gift" ar e words indicating an attitudinal pr oclivity for mastery. One tends to 
do well at one's calling. I think most good traders have a little extra spark about trading. Some

Chunk 3266 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
people are natural musicians or pain ters or salesmen or analysts. I think it is difficult to acquire 
talent for trading. However, if it is alrea dy there, it can be discovered and developed. 
What effect has trading had on your personal life? 
My personal life is integrated with my trading life.  
Is the joy of winning as intense as the pain of losing? 
The joy of winning and the pain of losing are right up there with the pain of  winning and the joy of

Chunk 3267 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
losing. Also to consider are the joy and pain of not participating. The rela tive strengths of these 
feelings tend to increase with the distance of th e trader from his commitment to being a trader. 
When you made your first few million, did you  lock some of it aw ay to avoid the Jesse 
Livermore experience? [Livermore was a famous  speculator of the early twentieth century 
who made and lost several fortunes.]

Chunk 3268 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
who made and lost several fortunes.] 
I feel the Livermore ex perience was a function of his psychol ogy and had little to do with the 
location of his assets. In fact, I remember reading that Jesse Liverm ore used to lock some of his 
winnings away and then find a key when he needed  to get at them. Therefore, locking up winnings 
would be necessary to emulate his experience, not to avoid it.  Furthermore, you would probably

Chunk 3269 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
also need to overtrade and have wipeouts, wh ile you simultaneously fired up your emotions with 
the burning desire to "win it right  back." Acting out this drama c ould be exciting. However, it also 
seems terribly expensive. One alternative is to k eep bets small and then to systematically keep 
reducing risk during equity drawdowns. That wa y you approach your safe money asymptotically 
and have a gentle financial and emotional touchdown.  85I notice there is no quote  machine on your desk.

Chunk 3270 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Having a quote machine is like having a slot mach ine on your desk— you end up feeding it all day 
long. I get my price data after the close each day. 
Why do so many traders fail in the marketplace? 
For the same reason that most baby turtles fail to reach maturity: Many are called and few are 
chosen. Society works by the attraction of the ma ny. As they are culled ou t, the good ones are left,

Chunk 3271 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
and the others are released  to go try something else  until they find their calli ng. The same is true for 
other fields of pursuit. 
What can a losing trader do to transform himself into a winning trader? 
A losing trader can do little to tran sform himself into a winning trad er. A losing trader is not going 
to want to transform himself. That' s the kind of thing winning traders do. 
How would you rate the relative importance between psychology and market analysis to 
successful trading?

Chunk 3272 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
successful trading? 
Psychology motivates the quality of analysis a nd puts it to use. Psychology is the driver and 
analysis is the road map. 
You have focused a lot on the field of psycholo gy. Can you tell by talking to a person whether 
that person would probably be  a winning or losing trader? 
Yes, the winning traders have usually been winni ng at whatever field they are in for years. 
What traits do you look for to id entify the winning trader personality? 
1. Не/she loves to trade; and

Win or lose, everybody gets what they want out of th e market. Some people seem to like to lose, so 
they win by losing money. 
I know one trader who seems to get in near the st art of every substantial bull move and works his

Chunk 3274 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
personality and loses it all back ag ain. This process repeats like cl ockwork. Once I traded with him, 
but got out when his personality changed. I doubled my money, while he wiped out as usual. I told 
him what I was doing, and even paid him a manageme nt fee. He just couldn't help himself. I don't 
think he can do it any differently. He wouldn't want t o. He gets a lot of excite ment, he gets to be a

Chunk 3275 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
martyr, he gets sympathy from his friends, and he gets to be the cen ter of attention. Also, possibly, 
he may be more comfortable relating to people if he  is on their financial plane. On some level, I 
think he is really getting what he wants. 
I think that if people look deeply enough into thei r trading patterns, they find that, on balance, 
including all their goals, they are really getting what they want, even though they may not 
understand it or want to admit it.

Chunk 3276 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
understand it or want to admit it. 
A doctor friend of mine tells a story about a cancer patient w ho used her cond ition to demand 
attention and, in general, to dominate others ar ound her. As an experiment prearranged with her 
family, the doctor told her a shot was available wh ich would cure her. She constantly found excuses 
to avoid appearing for the shot and eventually avoi ded it entirely. Perhaps her political position was

Chunk 3277 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
more important than her life. People' s trading pe rformance probably reflects their priorities more 
than they would like to admit. 
I think that some of the most fl amboyant and interesting traders ar e playing for more than profits 
alone; they are probably also playin g for excitement. One of the best ways to increase profits is to 
do goal setting and visualizations in order to align the conscious and subconscious with making

Chunk 3278 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
profits. I have worked with a numbe r of traders in order to examine their priorities and align their 
goals. I use a combination of hypnosis, breathing, pacing, visualization, gestalt, massage, and so 
forth. The traders usually either (1 ) get much more successful, or (2) realize they didn't really want 
to be traders in the first place. 
Surely, some people lose because they lack the skill, even though they really want to win.

Chunk 3279 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
It is a happy circumstance that when nature give s us true burning desires,  she also gives us the  86means to satisfy them. Those who want to win a nd lack skill can get someone with skill to help 
them. 
I sometimes have dreams related to the impe nding direction of a market. Although these 
dreams tend to be very infrequent, uncannily  they often prove right. Have you had any 
similar experiences? 
I know several people who claim to have market  insights during dreams. I think one of the

Chunk 3280 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
functions of dreams is to reconcile informatio n and feelings which th e conscious mind finds 
intractable. For instance, I once told a lot of my fr iends that I expected silver to keep on going up. 
When it went down instead, I igno red the signs and tried to tell myself it was just a temporary 
correction. I stood to lose face and money. I couldn' t afford to be wrong. Around that time, I had 
dreams of being in a big, shiny, silver aircraft that stalled out and started going down toward an

Chunk 3281 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
inevitable crash. I eventually dumped my silver po sition, even went short, and the dreams stopped. 
How do you judge success? 
I don't judge success. I celebrate it. I think su ccess has to do with finding and following one's 
calling regardless of financial gain. 
Don't be fooled by the humor in Seykota's comments; there is a great deal of  serious wisdom in his 
pithy replies. For me personally, the most striking comment was: "Everybody gets what they want

Chunk 3282 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
out of the market." When Seykota first made this remark, I thought he was merely being cute. But I 
soon realized he was deadly serious . My reflexive response to this pr emise was disbelief: It implies 
that all losers want to lose a nd all winners who fall short of thei r goals (like myself) are fulfilling 
some inner need for a constrained threshold of success—a difficult proposition to swallow. 
Although my rigidly logical mind would normally dismiss the idea, my respect for Seykota's

knowledge about markets and people forces me to cons ider the potential truth of the statement that 
everybody gets what they want out of the market—a most provocative concept.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  87Larry Hite-Respecting Risk 
Larry Hite's interest in the financial markets was sparked by a college course, but his path to Wall 
Street was as circuitous as Moses' to the Land of Israel. His early adult year s did not offer any clue

Chunk 3284 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that this was a young man headed for eventual ma jor success. First, his academic performance was 
inauspicious. Then he went through a string of odd jobs, never managing to hold any for very long. 
Eventually, he drifted into a dual  career of actor and screenwrite r. While not reco rding any major 
successes, he managed to support himself, and enj oyed his work. One of his movie scripts, which

Chunk 3285 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
never found its way into production, was optioned so of ten that he began to vi ew it as a source of 
steady income. 
One day, Hite heard H. L. Hunt on the radio describing how he made  his fortune buying up lots of 
cheap oil right options, which gave him the oppor tunity for occasional windfall profits with 
minimal risk. That same night, Hite briefly met Brian Epstein, the manager of the Beatles, at a

Chunk 3286 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
party. The two ideas fused in his mind, leading to another career change. He thought to himself, 
"Here is something [a rock prom oter] that has the potential fo r making a lot of money with a 
minimal investment." Although he landed a few reco rd contracts for some of his groups, none ever 
reached true stardom. Once again, although his success was limited, he managed to earn a 
satisfactory living in a self- employed position.

Chunk 3287 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Meanwhile, Hite's real interest remained in th e financial markets. "You often hear about people 
working on Wall Street to become screenwriters. I may be the only person who ever worked as an 
actor and a scriptwriterto pay fo rmy Wall Street career," he says  jokingly. In 1968, Hite finally 
decided to pursue his primary interest. While fascin ated with the futures mark ets, he didn't have the

Chunk 3288 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
slightest idea how to break into that field, so he  began as a stockbroker. Several years later, he 
became a full-time commodities broker. 
More than a decade passed before Hite, convinced th at he had learned the ingredients necessary for 
successful long-term trading performance, took the init ial steps that led to the ultimate formation of 
Mint Investment Management Company. He realized that his trading ideas n eeded to be subjected

Chunk 3289 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to rigorous scientific testing. With  an offer of partnership, but no immediate pay, he enlisted Peter 
Matthews, who held a Ph.D. in st atistics. One year later, he hired Michael Delman, a designer of 
computer systems for a defense electronics firm. Matthews and Delman br ought their own ideas to 
the table, but perhaps even more significantly, th eir work provided the mathematical proof that

Chunk 3290 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Hite's trading concepts were i ndeed statistically sound. Hite is emphatic that Mint's success would 
not have been possible without Matthews and Delman. 
Mint's objective was never to make the largest pe rcentage return. Rather, Hite's philosophy was to 
aim for the best growth rate consistent with extremel y rigorous risk control. It  is in this perspective 
(return relative to risk) that Mint really shines. From the in ception of trading in April 1981 through

Chunk 3291 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
mid-1988, Mint registered an aver age annual compounded return of ov er 30 percent. But it is their 
consistency that is most impressive: their annua l returns have ranged from a worst of plus 13 
percent to a best of plus 60 per cent. Their largest loss in any si x-month period was only 15 percent 
and under 1 percent in any twelve-mont h period (not just calendar years). 
Not surprisingly, Mint's stellar performance has re sulted in a spectacular gr owth of equity under

Chunk 3292 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
management. In April 1981, they began trading with $2 million; today, they manage over $800 
million. Significantly, there is no evidence that th e surge of money under management has had any 
deleterious effect on performance.  Hite believes that Mint can ultimately manage $2 billion—an 
unprecedentedly large sum for a futures fund. 
Our interview was conducted over lunch at Window s of the World atop New York's World Trade

Chunk 3293 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Center, on a day it was blanketed w ith clouds. We took the hint when we were the last ones left in 
the restaurant and finished the interview in Hite's office. 
How did you first get interested in markets? 
When I was in college, I took a business course  with a professor who ha d a trenchant sense of 
humor. To give you an example, he also worked  as a bank examiner. On e day, before leaving the

Chunk 3294 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
bank following an audit, he turned  to the bank president and, as a joke, said, "Got  you!" The man 
had a heart attack on the spot. After that, they did another audit and found that the bank president 
had embezzled $75,000. Anyway, in class one day, th is professor is reviewing all the financial  88instruments: stocks, bonds, and so on. Then he says , "Now we come to the craziest market of all—
commodities. Thesepeople trade on only 5 percentmargin—and most of them borrow that." The

Chunk 3295 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
whole class laughed, except me. For some reason, th e idea of trading on 5 percent margin made 
perfect sense tome. 
When did you first get involve d in the financial markets? 
Not until many years later. I was a rock promoter at the time, and on one weekend, there were three 
separate shootings in clubs at  which the groups I managed were  working. I decided it was an 
opportune time to change careers and pursue my tr ue interest—the financ ial markets. Although I

Chunk 3296 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
was really interested in futures, I didn't have any idea how to look for a job in that field. So I 
decided I would start out as a stockbroker. 
My first interview was with a very old-line Wall Street firm, with offices that made you feel like 
you should speak in hushed tones. The man who in terviewed me was the kind of guy [he adopts a 
pompously refined voice] who talks with his teeth together and lives in Connecticut. He tells me, 
"We only buy blue chips for our clients."

Chunk 3297 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
"We only buy blue chips for our clients." 
Not having a financial background, I was unfamiliar with the term  "blue chip," but it sounded odd 
to me in the context of a staid investment firm. So after the inte rview, I looked up its derivation. I 
found that the origin of the term could be traced to the color of th e most expensive chip in Monte 
Carlo. I said to myself, "Aha, now I know what this game is all about—gambling." I threw away

Chunk 3298 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
my copy of Graham and Dodd [Principles of Security Analysis, considered by many to be the 
"bible" of stock market an alysis] and bought a book called Beat the Dealer. I came away with the 
idea that successful investment was really a matter of odds, and if you could compute the odds, you 
could find and test methods th at could beat the market. 
What made you believe that you could deve lop methods to put the odds in your favor?

Chunk 3299 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I don't know that I understood it all then, but over th e years I came to reali ze that the markets are 
inefficient. I have a friend who is an economist. He  would try to explain to me, as if talking to a 
child, why what I was trying to do was futile, becau se "the markets are efficient." I have noticed 
that everyone who has ever told me that the market s are efficient is poor. He argued that if I could

Chunk 3300 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
develop a winning system on a computer, so could ot hers, and we would all cancel each other out. 
What is wrong with that argument? 
Because people develop systems and people will make  mistakes. Some will alter their system or 
jump from system to system as each one has a lo sing period. Others will be unable to resist second-
guessing the trading signals. Whenever I go to a m oney management conference and sit down with

Chunk 3301 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
a group to have some drinks at night, I always hear  the same story. "My system worked great, but I 
just didn't take the gold trade, and that  would have been my biggest winner." 
There is a very important message here: People don' t change. That is why this whole game works. 
In 1637, tulips in Holland traded for 5,500 florins and then crashed to 50, a 99 percent loss. Well, 
you might say, "Trading was relatively new then; th ese people were primitive; capitalism was still

Chunk 3302 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
in its infancy. Today we are much more sophisti cated." So you go to 1929 and find a stock like Air 
Reduction which traded at a high of $233 and after the crash fell to $31, a decline of 87 percent. 
OK, you might say, "The Roaring '20s were crazy tim es, but now things are su rely different." Move 
ahead to 1961 and you find a stock called Texas Inst ruments trading at $207. It eventually dropped

Chunk 3303 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to $49, a decline of 77 percent. If you think we have gotten more sophisti cated in the 1980s, all you 
have to do is look at silver pri ces, which in 1980 reached a peak of $50 and subsequently fell to $5, 
a 90 percent decline. 
The point is that because people are the same, if you use sufficiently rigorous methods to avoid 
hindsight, you can test a system and see how it w ould have done in the past and get a fairly good 
idea of how that system will perform in the future. That is our edge.

Chunk 3304 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Isn't it possible that the markets can change and the future will be very different from the 
past? 
The markets may change, but people won't. When we  were still in the testing stage, before we 
actually started managing any money, my partner Michael Delman came up with the concept of 
using holding periods as a measure of system pe rformance. Evaluating systems solely on a calendar  89year basis is very arbitrary. What you really wa nt to know are the odds for profitable performance

Chunk 3305 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
in a holding period of any length. In our simulations, Peter determ ined that 90 percent of all the six- 
month holding periods, 97 percent of the twelve -month periods, and 100 percent of the eighteen-
month periods would be profitable. After over seven years of actual trading, the numbers turned out 
to be 90 percent, 99 per cent, and 100 percent. 
I will tell you how confident I am of the future va lidity of our evaluation proc ess. There is a fellow

Chunk 3306 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
who works for us who used to be a colonel in  the British army. His service specialty was 
dismantling bombs all over the world. I asked him, "How did you do it?" "It wasn't that difficult," 
he says. "There are different styles  of bombs; a bomb in Malaysia is different from a bomb in the 
Middle East. You go there and see wh at kind of bomb it is and take it apart." I said, "Let me ask 
you a question. What happens when you come acro ss a bomb that, you don't know?" He looks me

Chunk 3307 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
in the eye and says, "You r ecord your first impression and hope it is not your last." 
I came into the office one day and found this same steel-nerved individual vi rtually on the brink of 
tears. I asked him what was wrong. It turned ou t that the Fed had made a major policy change, 
which dramatically reversed ma ny major market trends. Overnigh t, our fund, which had gone from 
a starting value of $10 to nearly $15, had fallen back to under $12, ju st after he had opened a major

Chunk 3308 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Swiss bank as an account. I told him, "Get them on the phone." "What?" he asked somewhat 
confused. I repeated [speaking more slowly and em phatically], "G-e-t t-h-e- m o-n t-h-e p-h-o-n-e." 
When I was a broker, my boss taught me that if you don't call your client when he is losing money, 
someone else will. And, to be honest, when I was a broker, I did the same thing. When I called 
prospects and they complained a bout their broker, I would say, "O h, how could he put you in that 
trade?"

Chunk 3309 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trade?" 
So I get the account on the phone and e xplain that our simulations show that this type of event will 
occur once every few years and that I am confident that in nine months th e fund will be back to a 
new high. "In fact," I said, "I have just borrowed some money to add to my own investment in the 
fund." "You really did that?" he asked in a surprised tone . I assured him that I did. 
Well, the account doubled up on their investment, a nd the fund immediately s hot straight up. Today

Chunk 3310 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that account is one of our biggest clients. How c ould I be so sure? I knew what those systems were 
about. What makes this business so fabulous is  that, while you may not know what will happen 
tomorrow, you can have a very good id ea what will happen over the long ran. 
The insurance business provides a perfect anal ogy. Take one sixty-yea r-old guy and you have 
absolutely no idea what the odds are that he will be alive one year later. However, if you take

Chunk 3311 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
100,000 sixty-year-olds, you can get an  excellent estimate of how ma ny of them will be alive one 
year later. We do the same thing; we let the law of large numbers work for us. In a sense, we are 
trading actuaries. 
I have a friend who went broke trading futures. He can't understand how I can trade by following a 
computerized system religiously. We were play ing tennis one day and he asked me, "Larry, how

Chunk 3312 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
can you trade the way you do; isn't it boring?" I told  him, "I don't trade for excitement; I trade to 
win." It may be very dull, but it is also very lucrative. When I ge t together with other traders and 
they start exchanging war stories about different tr ades, I have nothing to sa y. To me, all our trades 
are the same. 
There are many money managers who use trend-following systems—and quite a few of those

Chunk 3313 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
don't second-guess their own systems. What ma kes Mint different? How have you been able 
to achieve return/risk ratios far above the industry average? 
Because we know that we don't know. No matter what information you have, no matter what you 
are doing, you can be wrong. I have a friend who has amassed a fortune in excess of $100 million. 
He taught me two basic lessons. First, if you neve r bet your lifesty le, from a trading standpoint,

Chunk 3314 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
nothing bad will ever happen to you. Second, if you know what the worst possible outcome is, it 
gives you tremendous freedom. The tr uth is that, while you can't quantify reward, you can quantify 
risk. I will give you an example how important th is advice is. One of the world's largest coffee 
traders invited me to his house in London. When I wa lked into his library, I noticed he had just 
about every book ever written on power. He took me to  one of the finest restaurants I have ever

Chunk 3315 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
been at. At dinner, he asked me, "Larry, how can you know more about coffee than me? I am the 
largest trader in the world. I know  where the boats are; I know th e ministers." "You are right," I  90answered, "I don't know anything ab out coffee. In fact, I don't even  drink it." "How do you trade it 
then?" he asked. I told him, " I ju st look at the risk." Well this great meal la sted for several hours. 
Five times he asked me what I did, and five times I told him that I managed the risk.

Chunk 3316 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Three months later I heard that he had blow n $100 million in the coffee market. He obviously 
didn't get the message. And you want to know some thing? He does know more about coffee than I 
do. But the point is, he didn't look at the risk. 
So the very first rale we live by at Mint is: Neve r risk more than 1 percent of total equity on any 
trade. By only risking 1 percent, 1 am indifferent  to any individual trade. Keeping your risk small

Chunk 3317 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
and constant is absolutely critical. For exampl e, one manager I know had a large account that 
withdrew half the money he was trading. Instead of cutting his position size in half, this manager 
kept trading the same number of contracts. Eventually, that half  of the original money became 
lOpercent of the money. Risk is  a no-fooling-around game; it does not allow for mistakes. If you do 
not manage the risk, eventually they will carry you out.

Chunk 3318 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The second thing we do at Mint is that we always follow the trends  and we never deviate from our 
methods. In fact, we have a written agreement th at none of us can ever countermand our system. 
The trades are all the same. That is the reason w hy we have never had a ba d trade at Mint. There 
are really four kinds of trades  or bets: good bets, bad bets, winni ng bets, and losing bets. Most 
people think that a losing trade was a bad bet. Th at is absolutely wrong. Y ou can lose money even

Chunk 3319 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
on a good bet. If the odds on a bet are 50/50 and the payoff is $2 versus a $1 risk, that is a good bet 
even if you lose. The important point is that if  you do enough of those trades or bets, eventually 
you have to come out ahead. 
The third thing we do to reduce risk  is diversify. We diversify in tw o ways. First, we probably trade 
more markets worldwide than any other money ma nager. Second, we don't just use a single best

Chunk 3320 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
system. To provide balance, we use lots of diffe rent systems ranging from short term to long term. 
Some of these systems may not be that good by th emselves, but we really don't care; that is not 
what they are there for. 
The fourth thing Mint does to manage risk is track volatility. When the volatility of a market 
becomes so great that it adversely skews the expect ed return/risk ratio, we will stop trading that 
market.

Chunk 3321 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
market. 
Essentially, our approach has three lights in de termining the acceptance of trading signals. When 
the light is green, we take all signals. When th e light is yellow, we will liquidate an existing 
position on a signal, but we will not put on a ne w position. Finally, when the light is red, we 
liquidate existing positions automaticall y, and we do not take any new positions. 
For example, in 1986, when coffee went from $ 1.30 to $2.80 and back to $1.00, we got out of our

Chunk 3322 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
long positions on the way up at $1.70 and didn't trade the market for th e rest of the price climb and 
subsequent collapse. Now, while we may have lo st some additional profits, being out of markets 
like that is one of the ways we are able  to achieve such rigid risk control. 
So one of the key differences between you and other trend-following managers is that you 
have developed a way of defining when not to play?

Chunk 3323 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
In any situation or game, you can define a posi tional advantage for any player—even the weakest 
one. In trading, you can define three categories of pl ayers: the trade, the floor, and the speculator. 
The trade has the best product knowledge and the best ways of getting out of positions. For ex-
ample, if they are caught in a bad position in the fu tures markets, they can offset their risk in the

Chunk 3324 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
cash market. The floor has the adva ntage of speed. You can never be  faster than the floor. While 
the speculator doesn't have the product knowledge or  the speed, he does have  the advantage of not 
having to play. The speculator can choose to only bet when the odds are in his favor. That is an 
important positional advantage. 
You mentioned before that you used increased volat ility as a signal to stop trading a market.

Chunk 3325 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How many days of past data do you use to determine your volatility filter? 
Anywhere from ten to 100 days. 
When you say ten to 100, are you trying to be deliberately ambi guous or do you mean you use 
different time frames within that range? 
We look at different tim e windows in that range.  91I fully understand the logic of your 1 percent stop-loss rule. However, my one question is: 
Once you are stopped out of a position without the system providing an opposite signal,*

Chunk 3326 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
what gets you back into the trade if the market  reverses to its original direction? Isn't it 
possible that you could get stopped out on a moderate price reaction and then miss a 
subsequent major move? 
If the market makes a new high, we get back in. 
*For example, if a long position is stopped out on a money management rule without a sell signal 
actually being generated, the sy stem will still be in a long mode and no buy signal will be

Chunk 3327 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
generated, no matter how high pr ices go. (If, however, a sell signa l were generated, the system 
would begin monitoring for a buy signal.) 
But suppose that the market goes  into a wide trading range, might you not get continuously 
whipped between being stopped out and reentering the position at new highs? 
That happens, but not enough to be a problem. 
You have an incredibly strong respect for ri sk. Were there any personal events in your

trading career that ingraine d you with that attitude? 
When I first became involved in commodities, I noticed that if you bought pork bellies in 
September and sold them before July, you almost al ways made a profit. So I formed a fund with a

At the time, I had a friend who followed the corn market. I didn't know anything about corn; I only

Since this was supposed to be a relatively safe trad e, in that I was offsetting my long position in one 
contract month with a short position in another month, I really loaded up. Shortly thereafter, the 
government released a surprising crop estimate. In  response, the month I was long went limit-down 
and the month I was short went limit-up.

I was in such despair that I remember walking ou t to the stairway and lit erally getting down on my 
knees and saying out loud, "Dear God, I don't care how much I lose, but please don't let the account 
go into a debit." At the time, I was working for a s ophisticated intern ational firm, and just as I was 
making my providential plea,  a Swiss banker came walking down the staircase. To this day, I still 
wonder what he must have thought.

Were there any other personal tr aumatic experiences caused by a failure to heed market 
risk? 
Not for myself, but throughout my financial career, I have continually witne ssed examples of other 
people that I have known be ing ruined by a failure to respect ris k. If you don't take a hard look at 
risk, it will take you. 
When I was a kid and got my first motorcycle, I had an older friend who would always get into

Chunk 3332 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
fights. He told me, "Larry, when you are on a moto rcycle, never argue with  a car. You will lose." 
The same lesson applies to trading: If  you argue with the market, you will lose. 
The Hunt brothers are a perfect  example. Somebody once asked me , "How could the Hunts lose? 
They were worth billions." Let's say you have a billion dollars, and you buy $20 billion worth of 
silver—I am making these numbers up for the sake  of the example—you are in exactly the same

I have a good friend who started from very humb le beginnings; his father was a sanitation man. 
Anyway, he is a very bright guy and he got into  option arbitrage. He was extremely good at it and 
made a fortune. I remember visiting him at a palatial estate he bought in England. 
Well, he may have been a great ar bitrageur, but he turned out to be a bad trader. He developed a

Chunk 3334 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trading system that made money. On e day he said to me, "I am not taking the sell signal in gold; it 
doesn't look right to me. Besides, almost 50 pe rcent of the signals ar e wrong anyway." Not only 
didn't he take the sell signal, he actually wound up going long. Sure enough, the market went down. 
I told him, "Get out!" but he insi sted, "The market will come back." 
Well, he didn't get out, and he lost the mansion and everything else. Now he lives in a rented box

Chunk 3335 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
on a street with a hundred other ti cky-tacky houses. To this day, I still remember the name of his 
estate: "Beverly." He is still one of my best  friends, and his loss of that huge house had an 
enormous emotional impact on me. He had it and lost it all! And all because of one trade. The irony  92is that if he had followed his system, he would have made a fortune on that trade. 
I will tell you another story. I have a cousin who turned $5,000 into $100,000 in the option market.

Chunk 3336 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
One day I asked him, "How did you do it?" He answ ered, "It is very easy. I buy an option and if it 
goes up, I stay in, but if it goes down, I don't get out unt il I am at least even." I told him, "Look, I 
trade for a living, and I can tell you that strategy is ju st not going to work in the long ran." He said, 
"Larry, don't worry, it doesn't have to work in the long run, just till I make  a million. I know what I 
am doing. I just never take a loss." I said, "OK..."

Chunk 3337 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
In his next trade he buys $90,000 worth of Merrill Lynch options, only this time, it goes down, and 
down, and down. I talk to him about one month la ter, and he tells me he is in debt for $10,000.1 
said, "Wait a minute. You had $100,000 and you bought  $90,000 in options. That should still leave 
you with $10,000, even after they expired worthless. How coul d you have a deficit of $10,000?" He

Chunk 3338 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
said, "I originally bought the optio ns at $4k. When the price went down to $1,1 figured out that if I 
bought another 20,000, all it had to do was go back to $2^ for me to break even. So I went to the 
bank and borrowed $10,000." 
Respect for risk is not just a matter of trading; it applies to any type of  business decision. I once 
worked for a firm where the company president, a very nice guy, hired an option trader who was

Chunk 3339 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
brilliant, but not stable. One day the option trader disappeared, leav ing the firm stuck with a losing 
position. The president was not a trader, and he sought my advice. "Larry, what do you think I 
should do?" I told him, "Just get out of the positi on." Instead, he decided to hold on to the trade. 
The loss got a little worse, but then the market came back, and he  liquidated the pos ition at a small 
profit.

Chunk 3340 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
profit. 
After this incident, I told a friend who worked at the same firm, "Bob, we are going to have to find 
another job." "Why?" he asked. I answered, "We wo rk for a man who has just found himself in the 
middle of a mine field, and what he did was close his eyes and walk  through it. He no w thinks that 
whenever you are in the middle of a mine field, th e proper technique is to close your eyes and go

Chunk 3341 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
forward. Less than one year later, this same man had to liquidate a huge delta neutral spread 
position in options [a balanced position w hose value will change very li ttle for small price moves in 
either direction]. Instead of just getting out, he decided to get out of the position one leg at a time. 
By the time he finished liquidating that position, he had gone through all of the firm's capital. 
Besides errors in risk control, why do people lose money trading?

Chunk 3342 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Sometimes, because their trades ar e based on a personal bias, instead  of a statistical approach. For 
example, there is a regular panelist on "Wall Street  Week" who is about sixt y-five or se venty years 
old. On the show one day, he sa id that the lesson his father taught him was, "Bonds are the 
cornerstone of your portfolio." Thin k about that! Since this man firs t got into the business, he has

Chunk 3343 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
seen interest rates go down only once out of every eight у ears. [Bonds go up when interest rates 
decline.] Obviously, the name "bonds" mean s a lot more to him than the reality. 
You trade a very wide variety of markets.  Do you trade them all the same way? 
We don't trade markets, we trade money. Mickey Quenington, who is our marketing director, once 
introduced me to a former chief executive of this firm [E. F. Man, the firm to which Hite gave 50

Chunk 3344 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
percent ownership in his management company in exchange for financial backing]. This guy was a 
tough, old Irishman and he asked me, "How do you differentiate between gol d and cocoa in your 
trading?" I answered, "They are both a 1 percent be t; they are the same to me." He was outraged. 
He practically shouted back at me, "You mean to  tell me that you don't see any difference between 
gold and cocoa?" I think if it wasn't for the fact that he liked Mickey so much, he would have

Chunk 3345 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
thrown me out of his office. 
I married a very proper English wo man who is always concerned that her family considers me a bit 
crass. I was once intervie wed by a reporter from the London Times, who asked me what I thought 
about the future direction of the London cocoa ma rket. I told him, "Frankly, I don't see markets; I 
see risks, rewards, and money." I was the last person quoted in that article. He finished it by saying,

Chunk 3346 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
"Mr. Hite doesn't care about the cocoa market, al l he cares about is mone y." My wife read the 
article and said, "Great. Now I'll never be able to go home; this will just prove to my family that 
they were right about you all along." 
I assume that if you trade all markets the same, you probably don't believe in optimization.  93[Optimization refers to the process of testing many variations of a system for the past and

Chunk 3347 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
then selecting the best -performing version for actual trad ing. The problem with this fine-
tuned approach is that the link between past and future performance is often a very rough 
one.] 
Absolutely. We have a saying here : "It is incredible how rich you can get by not being perfect." We 
are not looking for the optimum method; we are looking for the hardiest method. Anyone can sit 
down and devise a perfect system for the past.

Chunk 3348 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
down and devise a perfect system for the past. 
Are there any technical indicators th at you have found to be overrated? 
Overbought/oversold indicators. None of them seem to prove out in testing. 
Any types of indicators you consider particularly valuable? 
Although I don't really trade off of them, there are tw o that come to mind. First, if a market doesn't 
respond to important news in the way that it should, it  is telling you something very important. For

Chunk 3349 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
example, when the news of the Iran/Iraq war fi rst came out over the newswire, gold was only able 
to move up $1.1 said to myself, "A Middle East war has just broken out and the best the gold 
market can do is go up $1; it has to be a great sale." The market broke sharply after that. The 
second item is something that Ed Seykota taught me. When a market makes a historic high, it is 
telling you something. No matter how many people te ll you why the market s houldn't be that high,

Chunk 3350 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
or why nothing has changed, the mere fact that th e price is at a new high tells you something has 
changed. 
Any other lessons that you learned from Ed Seykota? 
Ed Seykota actually explained his philosophy one day: "You can risk 1 percent of y our capital, you 
can risk 5 percent, or you can risk 10 percent, but you better re alize that the more you risk, the 
more volatile the results are going to be." And he was absolutely right.

Chunk 3351 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Besides your partners, who I know were integral  in developing your trading systems, were 
there any other traders who taught you valuable lessons? 
Absolutely. Jack Boyd, who hired me as a broker/ analyst. Having read that Handy and Harman had 
said in their annual report that silver stocks totaled either three billion or  seven billion ounces, I 
wrote a report on the silver market in which I said, "According to Handy and Harman, there is

Chunk 3352 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
either twice as much silver as some people think or less than half." That report went over very big 
with Jack and helped me land the job. 
Jack had been putting out trading recommendations fo r his firm for many years. I found that if you 
followed all of his recommendations, you would have  made money in every year. Finally, I asked 
Jack how he did it. You have to picture that Jack  was six foot-four. He said, "Larry, if you want to

Chunk 3353 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
know where a market is going, all you have to do is this." He thre w his charts on the floor and 
jumped up on his desk. He sai d, "Look at it, it will tell you!" 
I assume by that, he meant get a perspective of the big picture. 
Right, because I don't know of too many people who get rich by taking small profits. Working with 
Boyd was extremely important forme. From the tim e I met him, I knew that his approach was the

Chunk 3354 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
right way to do it. In other words, I knew that if you traded across the boa rd, controlled your risk, 
and went with the trend, it just had to work. I could see it absolutely clearly. 
Any final words? 
I have two basic rales about winning in trading as well as in life: (1) If you don't bet, you can't win. 
(2) If you lose all your chips, you can't bet. 
There are two basic elements to Hite's trading ph ilosophy. First, contrary to the opinion of many

Chunk 3355 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
academics, Hite is firmly convinced that the markets are inefficient. This means that if you can 
develop a method that places the odds in your favor (and it doesn't have to be by very much), you 
can win. Second, an effective method is a necessary, but  not sufficient, condition to win. In order to 
survive and thrive at trading, you also have to resp ect market risk. If you don't, sooner or later, it 
will get you. Hite controls risk rigorou sly by applying four basic principles:

Chunk 3356 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
1. His system never trades counter to the market  trend. There are no exceptions, and he always 
follows the system.  942. The maximum risk on each trade is li mited to 1 percent of total equity. 
3. Mint carries diversificat ion to an extreme. First, their system is really a combination of many 
different systems, selected not only for their indi vidual performance, but also for their degree of 
lack of correlation with  other selected systems. Second, Mint trades in an extr aordinarily wide

Chunk 3357 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
spectrum of markets (nearly sixty in all), encomp assing exchanges in the U.S. and five foreign 
countries and diverse market group s including stock indexes, intere st rates, currencies, raw in-
dustrial goods, and agricultural commodities. 
4. Volatility is continually tracked in each market in order to generate signals to liquidate or 
temporarily suspend trading in those markets where the risk/reward ratio exceeds well-defined 
limits.

Chunk 3358 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
limits. 
One final observation: After merely earning a mode st living at some colorful careers (such as, 
scriptwriter, actor, rock promoter), Larry Hite succeeded spectacularly in the single endeavor for 
which he had the greatest enthusiasm—fund manager.  I found this to be a striking example of Ed 
Seykota' s comment: "It is a happy circumstance that  when nature gives us true burning desires, it 
also gives us the means to satisfy them."

95Part II-Mostly Stocks   96Michael Steinhardt-The Concept of Variant Perception 
Michael Steinhardt's interest in the stock market da tes back to his bar mitzvah, when his father gave 
him 200 shares of stock as a present. He recalls  hanging out in the local  brokerage office as a 
teenager, watching the ticker tape along with th e old men, while his friends were out playing 
stickball. A very bright student, Steinhardt co mpleted his education at  an accelerated pace,

Chunk 3360 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
graduating from the Wharton School of the Univ ersity of Pennsylvania in 1960 at the age of 
nineteen. Steinhardt headed straight  for Wall Street, landing his first job as a research assistant. In 
subsequent years, he held positi ons as a financial journalist and a research analyst. In 1967, having 
established a reputation as a ta lented analyst, Steinhardt and two other partners founded the 
investment firm of Steinhardt, Fine and Berkowitz—the predecesso r to Steinhardt Partners. (Fine

Chunk 3361 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
and Berkowitz left the firm in the late 1970s.) 
In the twenty-one years since its inception, Steinhardt's firm has achieved a truly re markable track 
record. During that time, Steinhardt Partners has realized a compounded annual growth rate of over 
30 percent (just under 25 percent af ter subtracting a 20 pe rcent profit incentive fee). In comparison, 
the S&P 500 index registered only an 8.9 percen t compounded annual growth rate (dividends

Chunk 3362 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
included) during the same period. One thousand dollars  invested with the firm  at its start in 1967 
would have grown to over $93,000 by Spring 1988 (after deducting prof  it incentive fees). To put 
that in perspective, the same $1,000 invested in a basket of S&P stocks would only have grown to 
$6,400. Gain is only part of the st ory; Steinhardt's tr ack record also demonstrates admirable 
consistency. Steinhardt Partners has only witnessed two losing years.  In both cases, the net loss was

Chunk 3363 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
under 2 percent before profit incentive fee adjustments. 
Steinhardt's superior performance has been achieved by using a myriad of approaches. He is both a 
long-term investor and a short-term trader; he is as comfortable shorting stocks as buying them; he 
will shift major chunks of the fi rm's capital into other investment vehicles, such as treasury 
securities, if he feels that is  the best investment choice.

Chunk 3364 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
To be sure, Steinhardt Partners' track record is  not a solo performance. In addition to his 
cofounding partners, over the years, the firm  has employed numerous traders and analysts. 
However, there was never any doubt that Steinhardt  was clearly in charge. He reviews the firm's 
portfolio several times each day. A lthough he gives the firm's trader s latitude to make their own 
judgments, Steinhardt will require a trader to rigorously justify his position if he has qualms about

Chunk 3365 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that position. If he feels str ongly enough, Steinhardt will override the trader and liquidate the 
position. 
Steinhardt's extreme scrutiny and co ntrol of the firm's portfolio ha s given him a reputation of being 
a very demanding man to work for— obviously, too demanding for many of the traders who have 
left the firm over the years. Keeping in mi nd that Steinhardt's wraparound desk has been

Chunk 3366 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
constructed in the shape of a ship's bow, it is not surprising that one j ournalist doing a profile 
tagged him with the sobriquet, Captain Ahab. Ho wever, Steinhardt's tough side is very much 
related to his job role—much as in football co aching, toughness is probably a virtue in managing a 
group of traders. 
I never saw Steinhardt's tough side. The man I interv iewed was relaxed, soft  spoken, patient, and

Chunk 3367 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
good humored. (Of course, our interviews were always conducted outside of market hours.) 
Steinhardt possesses a keen sense of humor. He ha s been known to call friends impersonating an 
IRS agent, deliberately mumble fictitious orders to brokers right before the market close, and 
double-talk in a Dr. Irwin Corey - like manner when he wishes to pu ll the leg of an analyst or 
reporter who calls him. His conversation is al so liberally sprinkled with Yid-dishisms—

"proprietary dreck," for example, is how  he refers to newfangled fund products. 
What are the major elements of your trading philosophy? 
The word "trading" is not the way I think of things. I may be a trader in the sense that my frequency 
of transactions is relatively high,  but the word "investing" would appl y just as much, if not more. In 
my mind, trading implies an anticipa tion of a sale at the time of purchase. For example, if I go long

Chunk 3369 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
stock index futures tonight because I expect tomorrow's trade number will be bullish for the 
market, and I plan to sell my position tomorrow—th at is trading. The bulk of what I do is for a 
much longer duration and for more complex reas ons. For example, when I went long the debt  97markets in 1981, I held that posi tion for two and a half years. 
Well, for purposes of this book, I wo uld still call what you are doing trading.

Chunk 3370 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How then do you define the difference between trading and investing? 
I make two key distinctions. First, a trader w ill go short as readily as long. In contrast, the 
investor—for example, the portfolio manager of a typical mutual fund—will always be long. If he 
is uncertain about the market, he may be only 70 percent invested, but he is always long. The 
second distinction I make is that a trader is primar ily concerned about the direction of the market. Is

Chunk 3371 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the market, or stock, going up or down? The investor is more c oncerned about picking the best 
stocks to invest in. There is no value judgment involved in my distinc tion between traders and 
investors, it is merely a matter of  maintaining a certain thematic fo cus for this book. In  any case, on 
both counts, I would certainly quali fy you as a trader. To get back to my original question: How 
would you define your philosophy of trading?

Chunk 3372 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
would you define your philosophy of trading?  
My particular style is a bit different from that  of most people. Concep t number one is variant 
perception. I try to develop perceptions that I beli eve are at variance with the general market view. 
I will play those variant perceptions  until I feel they are no longer so. 
Could you give me an exam ple of variant perception in the current marketplace? 
We have been short Genentech for a year and a half. There was a period of months and months

Chunk 3373 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
when we lost a lot of money in that position. Bu t I stayed short because I continued to have a 
variant perception about th e future of their drug, TPA. [TPA can be injected intravenously to 
dissolve blood clots.] It is our perception that, in a year or two, TPA will be a minor drug that will 
be supplanted by more effective drugs that also co st substantially less. The thrust of the entire 
company has been based on this one drug. If our pe rception is correct, this company will be earning

Chunk 3374 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
20 or 30 cents per share and selling for under $1 0. The stock is currently at $27 [June 1988], down 
from a high of $65. [By late November, Genentech had fallen below $15 and Steinhardt was still 
short.] But I think the general perception is still th at Genentech is a fi rst class biotechnology 
company that will produce many products that ar e going to revolutionize th e industry. As long as 
my view is a variant perc eption, I will stay short.

Chunk 3375 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
That is a clear example, but it raises a questio n. Let's say you go short a stock because of your 
variant perception, and the position goes agains t you. If the fundamentals don't change, the 
more it goes against you, the more  attractive the short side wo uld appear. Yet from a money 
management standpoint, at some point, the posi tion would have to be covered. It seems like 
there might be two basic trading principles in conflict here.

Chunk 3376 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
There are certain shibboleths that exist in the worl d of trading, which may or may not be accurate, 
but I have not followed them. For example, there is  a general view that you shouldn't short a stock 
until it has already peaked and started down—that you shouldn't go short unti l the stock is already 
reflecting problems that are evident for all to see. In some sense, I can understand that. Maybe that

Chunk 3377 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
is a superficially safer way to short stocks and yo u can sleep more comfortably using that approach. 
However, I have never done it that  way. My attitude has always b een that to make money in the 
markets, you have to be willing to  get in the way of danger. I have  always tended to short stocks 
that were favorites and backed by a great deal of institutional enthusiasm. Genera lly speaking, I 
have tended to short too early and,  therefore, have usually starte d off with losses in my short

Chunk 3378 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
positions. If I short a stock and it goes up a lot, it may skew my exposure a bit, but as long as my 
variant perception is unchanged, I'll stay short. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. 
Are you saying that as long as you think the fundamentals, as you perceive them, are 
unchanged, you will hang tough no matter ho w much the position goes against you? 
Right. Of course, if it is triple horrible, I might  trade around the position to take the pressure down

Chunk 3379 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
a little bit. I would say, "OK, this looks awful; I see nothing bu t buyers. Why don't I join the buyers 
and see if I can make some money." In a matte r of speaking, I dichotom ize myself. I have a 
fundamental view, which I believe in my heart, but I try to separate that from the short-term fervor 
and intensity I may see in the market. So even t hough I am short in that t ype of situation, I might

Chunk 3380 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
periodically be a buyer.  98Might you actually go net long during those periods, or does your position just fluctuate 
between fully short and flat? 
It wouldn't even remotely approach flat, because that type of buying is based on very short-lived 
perceptions. I might take 20,30, or 40 percen t of the position an d trade with it. 
If you are very negative and shor t in a particular stock, but a re not necessarily bearish on the

Chunk 3381 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
industry, might you sometimes hedge yourself by  buying another stock in that group against 
your short position? 
I have tried that at times, but ha ve generally found it to be unsucc essful. What it tends to do is give 
me two problems instead of one. Usually, your k nowledge about the second stock on the other side 
will tend to be relatively skimpy because you are just grasping at it to use as a hedge. If your

Chunk 3382 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
problem is so great that you need  to hedge it, why not address the problem di rectly rather than 
taking on a totally separate position? Let's say you ar e short a paper stock and the paper stocks are 
roaring, so you buy another paper stock against it. Maybe your shor t stock will go up more; maybe 
the other stock will go up more. Who knows? If you ha ve made a mistake, deal with the mistake; 
don't compound it.

Chunk 3383 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
don't compound it. 
Besides the variant perception concept, what a re some of the other elements of your trading 
philosophy? 
Nothing that is so distinctive. I don'tuse stop-loss orde rs or such. I don't use any rules about buying 
on weakness or strength. I don't look at br eakouts or breakdowns. I don't use charts. 
You don't use charts at all? 
Charts just leave me blank. [He adopts a Jackie Mason-like speech pattern.] I look at the stock. It

Chunk 3384 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):

real breakout, blah, blah, blah, bla h. They all seem the same to me. 
But just from an informational standpoint, don' t you use charts as a quick and easy way to 
see where a stock has traded over the years? 
By watching stocks as closely as I do, I get some sense of price levels, uptrends, ranges, and all 
that.

Let's say you know that a stock has gone from $10 to $40, wouldn't it matter to you how it 
went from $10 to $40? 
It makes no difference to me. 
Do you have any trading rules that you could define? 
Give me an example of a trading rale. 
A common example might be: Before I get into a position, I know exactly where I am getting 
out. It doesn't necessarily have to be a risk control rule, it could be—

At this point, there is a call on the speakerphone. The caller is givi ng Steinhardt some late-breaking 
news regarding a decision in a lawsuit against the tobacco industry. "The verdict is back. Everyone 
was cleared except the Liggett group who had to pay a $400,000 fine and no punitive damages." 
Steinhardt replies, "So it was basically a deci sion slightly in favor of the defendants."

Chunk 3387 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I went short the tobacco stocks about a month ago. My reasoning was that if the plaintiffs won the 
case, the stocks would go down a lot, but if the plaintiffs lost, the stoc ks wouldn't go up too much, 
since the tobacco companies had never lost a case and winning another one wouldn't really be 
news. That is an example of a variant perception. It will be interesting to see how much I will lose, 
because my original theory was that it wouldn't be much. Here it is [reading story headline from

Chunk 3388 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
screen], "Liggett Group Found Liable for Cont ributing to Smoker's D eath." You know what, I 
won't lose anyway. A phrase like that will scare somebody. 
Going back to our discussion, let's say you are short a stock because of your fundamental 
analysis and the stock is going against you. How would you know when your analysis is wrong 
because you have overlooked some  unknown important element?

Chunk 3389 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
That situation happens fairly often. You buy or sell a stock and it doesn't act the way you think it  99should. I go through my portfolio six times a day. There are many stoc ks in the portfolio that I am 
not directly responsible for. For example, someone else is short Ti me, Inc. They are short because 
the magazine business is lousy, and this or that. But the stock is acting really strong and is up 10

In a sense, I am a negative monitor of the portfo lio. If there is a proble m with a position I will go

Chunk 3391 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
through it very regularly. That makes me a very di fficult person here, because I only talk to people 
when things are lousy or when their stocks are not acting like they should. 
If a stock is not acting like it should based on  its fundamentals, would that be the type of 
market action that would change your thinking? 
I try to assume that the guy on the other side of a trade knows as least as much as I do. Let's say I

Chunk 3392 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
buy Texaco at $52 and it suddenly goes down to $50. Whoever sold Texaco at $52 had a perception 
that was dramatically different from mine. It is  incumbent on me to find out what his perception 
was. 
What if you can't explain it? 
The explanation might be superficial or serious, but you can us ually get something. 
Let's take the situation of the tobacco companie s. On balance, the news that came out after

Chunk 3393 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the close sounded bearish. If the tobacco stocks  go down only modestly tomorrow and then 
come right back, would you cover your position? 
I would cover it anyway. I would co ver the position on the news. So once the news is out, the game 
is over for you. Right. That wa s the only reason I was short. 
OK, that answers the question too simply. Assume  you wanted to be short the tobacco stocks 
as a longer-term position and the market sh rugged off today's news and closed higher

Chunk 3394 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
tomorrow. Would you cover then? 
It depends on my reasons. If I wanted to be s hort the tobacco companies because I felt tobacco 
consumption was going to decline much more than  presently perceived, it wouldn't matter that 
much. If the market rallied tomorrow, I would have  to take advantage of it and sell some more. 
So you wouldn't care if the market didn't react to the news the way it should have, as long as 
you felt the main reason fo r being short was still valid.

Chunk 3395 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yes, but if the news was terrible and the stocks  were up, I would try to understand why. Sometimes 
the market has more information and the vari ant action is really telling you something. 
But haven't there been instances where your analysis was completely wrong? 
Sure. 
And you realized it somewhere down the road? 
Yes, and not necessarily so quickly. 
At this point, Steinhardt gets a phone call in which his side of the conversa tion is filled with non

Chunk 3396 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
sequiturs and deliberate mumbling. He then explains to me his occasi onal habit of pl aying practical 
jokes on callers. 
For example, I get a call from a broker who I ha ven't spoken to for a long time. I swoosh some 
papers around and then say, "Buy 30,000 shares of  ZCU [mumbles another sentence]." Did you 
understand what I said? 
No [I laugh].

anything else.  100Your fund is often labeled as a hedge fund becaus e it trades very differently than a typical 
mutual fund. Could you elaborate on the meaning of a hedge fund. 
The A.W. Jones Group has been given credit for be ing the first hedge fund. Originally, the term 
referred to a precise concept, which essentially said the following: We in the world of money 
management do not have the ability to forecast tre nds in the stock market, which are functions of a

Chunk 3399 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
host of variables that are largely beyond the consistent  ability of individuals to anticipate. But, what 
we as money managers can do, thro ugh careful analysis, is to make accurate judgments as to which 
companies are doing well versus those that are not. So, if one balanced long positions in stocks that 
were perceived to be relatively strong with short positions in st ocks expected to act poorly, the

Chunk 3400 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
market risk would be totally eliminated. For exam ple, if you loved Ford and hated General Motors, 
and for every dollar long Ford you  were short a dollar of General Motors, you might lose on your 
shorts, but if your judgment wa s good, you would come out ahead. S o, the original concept of a 
hedge fund totally emphasized the ability to pick stocks. 
Does anyone still trade that way? 
No, today, the term hedge fund is somewhat of a misnomer. The term now refers to a limited

Chunk 3401 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
partnership in which the general partner is typically paid on a performance basis, as opposed to 
more traditional money managers who are paid on assets managed. Typically, the manager of a 
hedge fund has a great deal more fl exibility than a traditional money manager, and that is really the 
key element. That flexibility could include being able to short stocks as  well as buy stocks, use 
options, futures, and so on. That is  what a hedge fund is in general terms, but the variations on the

Chunk 3402 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
theme cover a very wide continuum. 
What happened to the original concept of a hedge fund? 
The flexibility of the hedge fund structure attr acted numerous young, aggressive entrepreneurs in 
the 1960s because it allowed them an opportunity to start their own business at an early age in a 
way that wasn't otherwise possible. Those were times  of great stocks with wonderful stories. There 
were quite a number of stoc ks showing terrific growth.

Chunk 3403 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The people that came into the hedge fund business we re not theoretical practit ioners of the idea of 
hedging, but were more interested in the idea of being their own bo sses, and having the flexibility 
to be long a lot of stock. Although they also had the flexibility of being short, they didn't use it in 
any serious way. The word hedge has a very specifi c meaning in the English language. In most of 
these hedge funds, you could serious ly ask, "Where is the hedge?"

Chunk 3404 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
So they were hedge funds in name only? 
Correct. They wouldn't even call themselves hedge funds; they were embarrassed by the name. The 
term had a connotation of being shor t, and trading the short side had an anti-American ring to it. It 
was as if you were rooting for disa ster. So they started using the term [he a dopts a tone of mock 
pomposity] private partnership. 
Ironically, today, with the disi ntegration of the relatively sm ooth secular trends of the 1950s

Chunk 3405 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
and 1960s, the concept of a true hedge fund may make more sense than it did in its early days. 
Why aren't there any practitioners of th e hedge fund concept in its pure form? 
Because it is a very restricting approach. The pr emise of being a dollar l ong and a dollar short in 
some related entity requires using a lot of dollars  ineffectively. How different are Ford and General 
Motors going to be? They are both  affected by the same macroeconomic  factors. If yo u have to put

up some dollars for the long and some dollars fo r the short, you may be lucky to realize a 10 
percent difference over a period of a year—that is, assuming you are right. 
There is a group we are associated  with on the West Coast that sp ecializes exclusively in shorting 
stocks. The thought has been mentioned that maybe  they should neutralize their market exposure 
by being long an equal number of dollars in the st ock indexes as they are s hort in individual stocks,

because what they bring to the part y is the special ability to pick sh orts. That is the closest thing to

How does your own fund fit into the hedge fund concept? 
It fits in the sense that shorting is used activel y. We always have some shorts. I also spend a good

You mean 40 percent net long? 
Yes. In contrast, I would doubt th at the most conservative of t ypical mutual funds has had an 
average exposure of less than 80 pe rcent during the last twenty years.

Chunk 3409 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
On average, you have been about 40 percent ne t long. What range does that encompass? 
I remember being 15 or 20 percent net short at  one point, and, at anot her time, being over 100 
percent net long. 
So you have the flexibility of be ing net short as well as net long? 
Yes. One of the things I would emphasize about our  approach is its flexibility to shift market 
exposure so as to make it an exceptionally meaningful—sometimes  perhaps too meaningful—tool

How do you determine your outlook for the general market directio n, since that is obviously a 
very critical element of your approach? 
It is really beyond definition, except to say that ther e are a host of variables, with some sometimes 
more important than others, and they change all the time. Having done it as long as I have gives me 
the opportunity to be 51 percent ri ght rather than 50 percent right.

Chunk 3411 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Does that imply that your main profitability comes from stock selection as opposed to net 
exposure adjustments for anticipated ch anges in the broad market direction? 
No, I was being a bit facetious. It is more than a 1 percent edge, but  it is not a big advantage like 
being right 80 percent of the ti me, or anything approaching that. 
Relatively speaking, how important is the bias  of the right market direction versus stock

Chunk 3412 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
selection as a contributing factor to  your overall superior performance? 
As I look back on the past twenty-one years, ther e is no set pattern of successful activity. In some 
years, we did particularly well on the strength of a few well-chosen stocks. In other years, we did 
exceptionally well because we were on the right side of the market. For example, in 1973-1974, 
when the market went down enormously, we were  up substantially, largely because we were net

Chunk 3413 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):

message in the fact that there is no real pattern:  Anyone who thinks he can formulate success in this 
racket is deluding himself, because it changes to o quickly. As soon as a formula is right for any 
length of time, its own success carries the weight of its inevitable failure.

The anticipation of a recession. 
Based on what? 
I felt that the higher inflation rates of that period would lead to higher interest rates, which, in turn, 
would slow down the economy. 
Were you negative on the stock market in th e period preceding the major 1982 bottom as

Not as strongly. But in 1981 and 1982,1 made an  enormous amount of money by having a

focusing on which stocks to buy—although you might focus on the short side . What was unique in 
that period was the inevitability of  a turn in interest rates in order for anything else to be

Chunk 3416 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
worthwhile; it was simply a matter of timing that turn . In contrast to most ot her periods, this period 
had a clear unidirectional message: U.S. Treas ury fixed income securities were by far the

rate of inflation. 
So, some of the pieces of the puzzle were already in place? 
Yes, and that is as much as you can hope for, be cause when they are all in  place, it is too late. 
You mention a contrarian mentality, but that type  of thinking could have justified trying to

Chunk 3418 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):

Absolutely. People think that being a contrarian implies victory. After all, what is a contrarian but 
someone that goes against the crowd. It is almost  a cliche that the crowd is always wrong—so the 
guy who stands against the crowd must always be right. Well, lif e doesn't work that way. There 
were plenty of contrarians who bought bonds when interest rates we nt to 8 percent for the first

Chunk 3419 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
time, and 9 percent, and 10 percent. There was a great deal of money lost by people buying bonds 
at what were then all-time high yields. 
There is a very important differe nce between being a theoretical c ontrarian and dealing with it in 
practical terms. In order to win as a contraria n, you need the right timing and you have to put on a 
position in the appropriate size. If  you do it too small, it's not meaningful; if you do it too big, you

understanding of your own psychology. 
I assume that you probably had the market r un against you for quite a while in that trade. 
Right, it did. It was a very painful period, because as far as most of my i nvestors were concerned, I

there is no real constraint.

[interest rate peak]? 
I started buying in the spri ng of!981,andl think treasuries bottomed on September 30,1981. 
How much did rates move against you in that first half year?

Chunk 3423 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I don't recall, but rates went up enough to be pain ful, especially given the size of my position. 
Up until this time, you had primarily been a stock trader. Here on your first major foray in 
treasuries, you started out by incurring substa ntial losses. Didn't you have periods of self-
doubt? 
All the time. The summer of 1981 was the worst experience of my busine ss life. A number of 
thoughtful, intelligent investors were really very unhappy with what I was doing—and I wasn't so

Did you ever come close to saying, "Maybe I am wrong," and liquidating, or at least 
decreasing, your position? 
No, never. 
One of your basic principles seem s to be that as long as you  believe you are fundamentally 
right, you will stay with a position. Have there been any exceptions—that  is, markets in which

recession. And whenever that recession would come , its impact would be horrendous because the

you have to conclude that this problem was internal  to the market; it wasn't that the market was

Chunk 3433 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
forecasting an imminent financial debacle or great recession. 
How then do you explain the extreme nature of the October 19 price break? 
The problem that led to the Octo ber 19 collapse was the combina tion of relatively modest real 
world changes and an inability of the markets' mech anism to deal with the institutional changes that 
occurred mostly during the 1980s. The elements  of stability—the indi vidual investor and the 
specialist system—had been grea tly reduced in importance.

Do you believe portfolio insurance exacerbated the decline? [P ortfolio insurance is the

decline. See Appendix 1 for more detail.]

On the other hand, you had the cr eations of the 1980s—portfolio in surance, program trading, and

participants in these strategies tend to be buyers and sellers at th e same time. The stock market was 
not prepared to handle it.  104Where were you, position wise, coming in on October 19? 
I came in very much long exposed—80 to 90 per cent—and I increased my exposure during the day. 
Why? Were you still bullish?

Chunk 3436 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Why? Were you still bullish? 
My increasing exposure was strictly a contrarian trade in the sense that when the markets have an 
enormous move, most of the time, it is right to take the view that there is a lot of emotionalism and 
extremism in that move. If you can maintain a bit of distance from the em otionalism, you tend to do 
well. So my buying that day is what I would have done on any 300-, 400-, or 500-point down day. 
Did you stay with your long position?

No, I reduced it throughout the next two months. The magnit ude of the decline and the

that they are necessarily qualified to do it terribly  well, but because they have come to recognize

Do you think the mutual fund industry is going to change?

How do you handle a losing period? 
As is true for so many other questio ns in this business, there is no pat answer or formula. There is 
nothing that can be articulated  precisely enough to lead othe rs in a certain direction. 
In other words, one losing period may be suffi ciently different from anot her so that, even for 
yourself, there may be no gen eral wisdom that applies. 
Correct. 
How did you get started as a fund trader?

Chunk 3443 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How did you get started as a fund trader? 
When I first got into this business in the late 1960s, I only had an analytical background. I was an 
agricultural equipment and cyclical goods analyst at Loeb Rhoa des. My business was started with 
two other fellows who were also analysts. As ou r business grew, trading became more important. I 
became the trader for the firm, having had very little trading background.  105If you had very little experience,  why did you become the trader?

Chunk 3444 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I probably wasn't as good an analyst as the other two. 
Even in those early years, you did very well as  a trader. How do you think you managed that 
without benefit of experience? 
My father has been a gambler all his life. Although I can't remotely justify it, I feel there is an 
element of gambling in this business. Ma ybe I got that talent from my father. 
You have traded the stock market for over twen ty years. Have you noticed any significant 
changes during that time?

Chunk 3445 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
changes during that time? 
The amount of intellectual power on  the trading desks twenty year s ago was minimal compared to 
today. The institutional traders were typically kids from Brookl yn, who could hardly speak the 
language, made a minimum amount of money, and had very little discretion. So  when I first started 
trading, it was like taking candy from a baby. 
I remember once a trader needed to sell 700,000 shar es of Penn Central. At the time, the stock was

Chunk 3446 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
already in Chapter 11. The last trade was at 7, and the seller didn't both er to check the board. I 
bought 700,000 shares at 6'/ 8. The seller was relieved to sell that amount of stock at less than a 
dollar under the last trade. Meanwhile, I turned around and sold the 700,000 shares at 61.1 could 
have sold three times that amount at that price. I made a half million dollars on that trade, and it 
took me all of twelve seconds. 
How long did that environment last?

Chunk 3447 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How long did that environment last? 
Until the consolidated tape in 1975. Now there is a lot more competition; the people on the trading 
desks are much brighter. Another ch ange is that retail buyers and sell ers have diminish ed greatly in 
importance. The market has become institutiona lized. Individuals buy stock through mutual funds. 
Brokerage firms don't sell customers stocks so mu ch as they sell those horrible mutual funds and 
other awful things they call "financial products."

Chunk 3448 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Perhaps the most important change is that the wo rld has become much more  short term oriented. 
All sorts of people who used to be investors are now traders. The in stitutions now define 
themselves as enterprises whose goal is to achiev e the highest rate of return, when they used to 
define themselves as long-term investors. People's confidence in their ability to predict secular 
trends has greatly diminished. In 1967, it would be  typical to see a report by a brokerage firm

Chunk 3449 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
estimating McDonalds' per share earnings up to the year 2000. Those people thought they could 
estimate long-term earnings because companies were growing in a stable and predictable way. 
They believed in America and steady growth. Toda y, stocks don't lend themselves to the same type 
of secular analysis. 
The implication of secular growth trend analysis  not having worked in the 1970s and 1980s relates

Chunk 3450 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to the question of trading. In th e 1950s and 1960s, the heroes were  the long-term investors; today, 
the heroes are the wise guys. There are people lik e Goldsmith, who lauds the virtues of capitalism. 
He talks about "what I did for Goodyear." What di d he do for Goodyear? He was in there for seven 
months, made eight zilli on dollars for himself, and left the ma nagement after taking greenmail. He

Chunk 3451 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
talks about what he did for Goodyear, because he is uncomfortable and has to somehow associate 
himself with the capitalist process. He and th ese other people have to bitch and moan about 
management, but they don't know their ass from their elbow about running companies. With the 
breakdown of certain laws, people are allowed to do things they weren't allowed to do before. 
What laws are you referring to?

What laws are you referring to? 
The Justice Department's reinterpretation of take over laws; the definition of  what is and is not 
monopolistic. 
What would be the most important ad vice you could give to the layman? 
One of the allures of this business is that sometim es the greatest ignoramus can do very well. That 
is unfortunate because it create s the impression that you don't necessa rily need any professionalism

Chunk 3453 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to do well, and that is a great trap. So the majo r advice I would give any body is: Recognize that this 
is a very competitive business, and that when yo u decide to buy or sell a stock, you are competing 
with people who have devoted a good portion of th eir lives to this same  endeavor. In many in-
stances, these professionals are on the opposite side of your trades and, on balance, they are going  106to beat you.

Chunk 3454 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Is the implicit message that, most  of the time, the novice trader would be better off having his 
money professionally managed? 
The term professionally managed implies a cred it I am not sure I w ould give the average 
professional in this business. My point is that you should have a good reason to assume that you are 
going to achieve a significantly s uperior return for investing in stocks. If you can get 9 percent or

Chunk 3455 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
10 percent by investing in T-bonds and 7 percent or  8 percent by investing in  T-bills, what should 
you get in stocks to offset the incremental risk ? Probably something much higher. You have to 
decide what that number should be, and whethe r you have a realistic ch ance of achieving it. 
Don't underestimate the difficulty of the game. 
Right, and forget the shibboleth th at stocks are going to give you a higher rate of return because

Chunk 3456 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
they are more risky. That is not true. They are more  risky; therefore, you have to be convinced that 
you are going to get a higher rate of return in order to play the game. Don't assume that by 
investing in some mutual fund, you are goi ng to get a higher rate of return. 
Isn't that true, though? Historically, hasn't the stock market significan tly beat interest rate 
returns? 
True, but there is a lot of statistical mumbo jumbo involved. Average return ca lculations depend

Chunk 3457 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
heavily on the starting date. If you start in 1968 or  1972, for example, the numbers look a lot less 
appealing. 
What are the elements of good trading? 
Good trading is a peculiar balance between the convict ion to follow your ideas and the flexibility to 
recognize when you have made a mistake. You need to believe in something, but at the same time, 
you are going to be wrong a cons iderable number of times. The balance between confidence and

Chunk 3458 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
humility is best learned through extensive experi ence and mistakes. There should be a respect for 
the person on the other side of the trade. Always ask yourself: Why does he want to sell? What 
does he know that I don't? Finally, you have to be intellectually honest with yourself and others. In 
my judgment, all great trad ers are seekers of truth. 
Steinhardt's variant perception is basically a co ntrarian approach. But you can't be a successful

Chunk 3459 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
contrarian by just using sentiment survey numbe rs or other measures of bullish consensus. The 
markets don't pay off that easily. Although sentiment is always very bullish at tops and very bearish 
at bottoms, unfortunately, extreme bullish and bearish readings are also characteristic of extended 
trends. The trick is not being a co ntrarian, but being a contrarian at  the right time. Such judgments

Chunk 3460 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
cannot be made on the basis of simple formulae. The successful contrarian needs to be able to filter 
out the true opportunities. Steinhardt's filters are a combination of a keen sense of fundamentals 
and market timing. 
Flexibility is another essential key to Steinhardt's extremely fa vorable return/risk performance 
characteristics. This flexibility is demonstrated by the equal ease at which he goes short or long, as

Chunk 3461 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
well as his willingness to trade markets other than  stocks when warranted by his perception of the 
fundamentals. "The more things you bring to the table—shorting, hedging, participation in bond 
markets, futures market trading, and so on—the better off you are," he says. 
One trait I have noticed among a number of the great  traders is their willi ngness and ability to take 
on a particularly large position when they percei ve a major trading opportunity. The nerve and skill

Chunk 3462 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
required to step on the accelerator at  the right time is certainly one of the elements that separates 
good traders from exceptional trader s. Steinhardt's heavy position in treasury notes  during 1981 and 
1982 is a perfect example of this characteristic. 
Conviction is probably an important quality for a ny trader, but it is essent ial to the contrarian 
trader. Steinhardt has repeatedly  demonstrated amazing resolve in maintaining large positions

Chunk 3463 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
during difficult times, as long as he was convinced  he was still right. Witness his conviction in 
staying with his treasury note position during the six-month climax in interest rates in 1981, 
remaining immune not only to the market move agains t him, but also to the psychological pressures 
of complaining investors who questioned his sudde n transition into treasuries after a career as a

Chunk 3464 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
stock trader. Throughout it all, Steinhardt held on, and even built his position, because he remained  107convinced that he was right. W ithout his strong sense of convi ction, the world probably would 
never have heard of Michael Steinhardt. 
Steinhardt also stresses that there are no absolu te formulae or fixed patterns. The markets are 
always changing, and the successful trader needs to  adapt to these changes. In Steinhardt's view,

Chunk 3465 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
traders who try to find fixed approaches w ill be doomed to failure sooner or later. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  108William O'Neil-The Art of Stock Selection 
William O'Neil is an unreserved optimist and ebullient fan of the American economic system and 
its possibilities. O'Neil says, "G reat opportunities o ccur every year in America. Get yourself 
prepared and go for it. You will find that little  acorns can grow into giant oaks. Anything is

Chunk 3466 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
possible with persistence and hard work. It can be done, and your own determination to succeed is 
the most important element." 
O'Neil is living proof of his own words: a cla ssic American success story. Born in Oklahoma 
during the lean Great Depression years and raised in  Texas, he went on to build dual fortunes as 
both an immensely profitable investor and a highly successful businessman. 
O'Neil began his financial career  as a stockbroker for Hayden, St one and Company in 1958. It was

Chunk 3467 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
there that he first began the research that led to the formulation of the key elements of his 
investment strategy. O'Neil's trading concepts prove d remarkably effective from the start. During 
1962-63, by pyramiding the profits in three excep tional back-to-back trad es—short Korvette, long 
Chrysler, and long Syntex—he managed to pa rlay an initial $5,000 investment into $200,000. 
In 1964, O'Neil used his investment winnings to buy a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and

Chunk 3468 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to form William O'Neil and Co., an institutional research brokerage firm. His firm was a leader in 
offering comprehensive computerized stock market in formation and today is one of the most highly 
respected securities research firms in the count ry. William O'Neil and Co. services more than 500 
major institutional accounts and 28,000 individual subscribers to their Daily Graphs charting 
service. The firm's data base contains 120 different statistics on each of 7,500 securities.

Chunk 3469 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
In what was certainly his boldest  endeavor, in 1983, O'Neil launched Investor's Daily in direct 
competition with the Wall Street Journal. He financed the newspaper with his own funds, knowing 
that it would be many years before he could hope to break even. Skeptics abounded when the paper 
began with a press run under 30,000 in 1984, compared to over two million for the Wall Street 
Journal. By mid-1988, Investor's Daily's subscribership had expanded to over 110,000, and the

Chunk 3470 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
growth in circulation was accelerating. The es timated breakeven point of 200,000 subscribers no 
longer seems far-fetched. O'Neil believes Investor's Daily can eventually grow  to 800,000 readers. 
His unflagging confidence in the paper stems from the fact that Investor's Daily' s financial tables 
contain statistical information unavailable anywhe re else— earnings per share (EPS) rank, relative 
strength, and volume percent ch ange. (These measures are di scussed in the interview.)

Chunk 3471 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
In 1988, O'Neil combined his concepts in the book How to Make Money in Stocks, published by 
McGraw-Hill. The book combines clarity and brevity  with excellent and very specific trading 
advice. It was the best-selli ng investment book of the year. 
O'Neil's various business ventures have not impede d his performance as a virtuoso stock investor. 
During the past ten years, O'Ne il has averaged over a 40 per cent profit annually on his stock

Chunk 3472 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
investments. Some of his biggest winners were the Canadian oils during the 1970s and Pic'n'Save 
and Price Co. during the late 1970s and early 1980s . Perhaps O'Neil's most famous market calls 
were two full-page Wall Street Journal ads heralding imminent major bull markets. The timing of 
these ads could hardly have been better: March 1978 and February 1982. 
William O'Neil and Company is a no-frills operation. Rarely have I seen a more crowded office

Chunk 3473 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
environment. O'Neil, however, does not single himsel f out for any special priv ileges. In what must 
surely be a rarity among chief executive officers,  he shares his office with two other employees. 
O'Neil impressed me as being articulate, confid ent, opinionated, and very bullish on America. 
I think it would be fair to describe your st ock investment approach as individualistic and 
original. Where did you first develop your trading ideas?

Chunk 3474 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I went through the same process that most people do. I subscribed to a few investment letters and 
most of them didn't do too well. I found that theori es like buying low-priced stocks or stocks with 
low price/earnings (P/E) ra tios were not very sound. 
When did you first find an approach that worked? 
Back in 1959,1 did a study of the people that were doing very well in the market. At that time, the

Chunk 3475 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Dreyfus fund was a very small fund, managing onl y about $15 million. Jack Dreyfus, who managed 
the fund, was doubling the results of all of his compe titors. So I got copies of their prospectus and  109quarterly reports and plotted on charts precisely where they had purchased each of their stocks. 
There were over 100 of these securities and when I laid them out on a table, I made my first real 
discovery: Not some, not most, but every single st ock had been bought when it went to a new high

Chunk 3476 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
price. 
So the first thing I learned about how to get superi or performance is not to buy stocks that are near 
their lows, but to buy stocks that are coming out of broad bases and begi nning to make new highs 
relative to the preceding price base . You are trying to find the begi nning of a major move so that 
you don't waste six or nine months sitti ng in a stock that is going nowhere. 
I studied the stocks that were big winners in past years and tried to find the characteristics they had

Chunk 3477 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
in common before they became major successes. I didn't just limit myself to preconceived notions 
like P/E ratios; I examined a lot of variables to develop a model based on how the real world 
worked. 
Can you describe this model for picking winning stocks? 
I use the easy-to-remember acronym CANSLIM. Each letter of this name represents one of the 
seven chief characteristics of th e all-time great winning stocks durin g their early developing stages, 
just before they made huge advances.

Chunk 3478 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
just before they made huge advances. 
The "C" stands for current earnings per share. The best performing stocks showed a 70 percent 
average increase in earnings for the current qua rter over the same quarter in the prior year before 
they began their major advance. I am continuall y amazed by how many individual investors, and 
even pension fund managers, buy  common stocks with unchange d or lower current quarter

Chunk 3479 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
earnings. There is absolutely no re ason for a stock to go up if the current earnings are poor. If, as 
our research demonstrated, the best  stocks had large profit increases  before they advanced rapidly 
in price, why should anybody settle for mediocre ear nings? So, our first basic rule in stock selection 
is that quarterly earnings per share should be up by at least 20 to 50 percent year to year.

Chunk 3480 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The "A" in our formula stands for annual earnings  per share. In our studi es, the prior five-year 
average annual compounded earnings growth rate of outstanding performing stocks at their early 
emerging stage was 24 percent. Ideally, each year 's earnings per share should show an increase 
over the prior year's earnings. 
It is a unique combination of bot h strong current earnings and high average earnings growth that

Chunk 3481 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
creates a superb stock. The EPS rank, which is published in lnvestor's Daily, combines a stock's 
percent earnings increase  during the past two quarters with the past five-year average percent 
earnings and compares that figure to every other stock we cover. An EPS rank of 95 means that a 
company's current and five-year historical earn ings have outperformed 95 percent of all other 
companies. 
The "N" in our formula stands fo r something new. The "new" can be a new product or service, a

Chunk 3482 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
change in the industry, or new management. In  our research we found that 95 percent of the 
greatest winners had something new that fell within  these categories. The "new" also refers to a 
new high price for the stock. In our seminars we find that 98 percent of investors are unwilling to 
buy a stock at a new high. Yet, it is one of the great  paradoxes of the stock market that what seems 
too high usually goes higher and what seems too low usually goes lower.

Chunk 3483 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The "S" in the formula stands for shares outsta nding. Ninety-five percen t of the stocks that 
performed best in our studies had less than twen ty-five million shares of capitalization during the 
period when they had thei r best performance. The average capita lization of all of these stocks was 
11.8 million shares, while the median figure wa s only 4.6 million. Many institutional investors 
handicap themselves by restricting their purchases to only large-capitalization companies. By doing

Chunk 3484 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
so, they automatically eliminate some of the best growth companies. 
The "L" in our formula stands for leader or laggard. The 500 best-performing stocks during the 
1953-1985 period had an average relative strength of 87 before their major price increase actually 
began. [The relative strength measur es a stock' s price performance during the past twelve months 
compared to all other stocks. For example, a rela tive strength of 80 would mean that the given

Chunk 3485 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
stock outperformed 80 percent of all other stocks dur ing the past year.] So, another basic rule in 
stock selection is to pick the leading stocks—the ones with th e high relative strength values—and 
avoid the laggard stocks. I tend to restrict purcha ses to companies with relative strength ranks 
above 80.  110The "I" in the formula stands for institutional s ponsorship. The institutional buyers are by far the

Chunk 3486 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
largest source of demand for stocks. Leading stoc ks usually have institutional backing. However, 
although some institutional sponsorship is desired, excessive sponsorship is not, because it would 
be a source of large selling if a nything went wrong with the company or the market in general. This 
is why the most widely owned inst itutional stocks can be poor perf ormers. By the time a company's

Chunk 3487 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
performance is so obvious that al most all institutions own a stock, it is probably too late to buy. 
The "M" in our formula stands for market. Three out of four stocks will go in  the same direction as 
a significant move in the market averages. That is  why you need to learn how to interpret price and 
volume on a daily basis for signs that the market has topped. 
At any given time, less than 2 percent of the st ocks in the entire mark et will fit the CANSLIM

Chunk 3488 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
formula. The formula is deliberately restrictive b ecause you want to pick only the very best. If you 
were recruiting players for a baseball team, woul d you pick an entire lineup of .200 hitters, or 
would you try to get as many .300 hitters as possible? 
Since you use such a restrictive selection proce ss, do you have a high  percentage of winning 
trades? 
I guess over the years, about two- thirds of my stock purchases we re actually closed at a profit.

Chunk 3489 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
However, I have found that only one  or two stocks of every ten I ha ve bought have tu rned out to be 
truly outstanding. 
Wouldn't most of the indicato rs in your CANSLIM formula, such  as EPS, pick up a stock 
before it goes to new highs? Why not just buy the stock when it is still forming a base instead 
of waiting for it to go to a new high? 
You don't want to anticipate a breakout from a ba se because a stock may never break out. You can

Chunk 3490 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
buy too soon as well as too late. Th e idea is to buy when there is the least proba bility of a loss. If 
you buy within the base, the stock will frequently fluctuate 10 or 15 percent in normal trading 
action, and it is very easy to get shaken out of the position. But if I buy at exactly the right time, the 
stock is usually not going to go down to  my maximum 7 percent stop-loss point. 
You have stated that the superior stocks ha ve high relative strength figures—80 or higher.

Chunk 3491 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Although high relative strength is good, is there such a thing as it being too high? In other 
words, might a relative strength of 99 indicate  that the stock is overextended and vulnerable 
to a sharp correction? 
You have to look at a chart to make that determ ination. The key point is not how high the relative 
strength is, but rather how far the stock is ex tended beyond its most recent price base. You buy

Chunk 3492 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
stocks that have a high relative strength if they  are just beginning to emerge from a sound base-
building period. However, I would generally not buy a stock with a high re lative strength that is 
already more than 10 percent beyond its prior price base. 
The "M" in the CANSLIM formula makes sense since few stocks can buck a general bear 
market. However, that rule sounds easier in theory than in practice. After a ll, how do you tell

Chunk 3493 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the difference between a market top a nd a normal bull market correction? 
Top formations in the market averages occur in only one of two ways. First, the average moves up 
to a new high, but does so on low volume. This tell s you that the demand for stocks is poor at that 
point and that the rally is vulnerable. Second, vol ume surges for several days, but there is very 
little, if any, upside price progress as measured by market closes. In this latter case, there may not

Chunk 3494 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
be a pickup in volume when the market initially tops, since the distribution has taken place on the 
way up. 
Another way to determine the direct ion of the general market is to  focus on how the leading stocks 
are performing. If the stocks that have been leading the bull mark et start breaking down, that is a 
major sign the market has topped. Another importa nt factor to watch is  the Federal Reserve

Chunk 3495 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
discount rate. Usually, after the Fed raises the rate two or three times , the market runs into trouble. 
The daily advance/decline line is sometimes a useful indicator to watch for signs of  a market top. 
[The advance/decline line illustrates the differen ce between the total number of New York Stock 
Exchange stocks advancing each day versus the nu mber declining.] Frequently, the advance/decline

Chunk 3496 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
line will lag behind the market averages and fail to  penetrate prior peaks af ter the averages reach  111new highs. This indicates that fewer stocks are participating in the market advance. 
When you believe that the general market ha s entered a bearish phase, would you advise 
going short rather than m erely liquidating longs? 
I don't normally advise people to sell short unless th ey are professional traders. Selling short is

Chunk 3497 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
quite tricky. I myself have only ma de significant profits on the shor t side of two of the last nine 
bear markets. 
A stock should never be sold short because its pri ce looks too high. The idea is not to sell short at 
the top, but at the right time. Short selling of i ndividual stocks should only be considered after the 
general market shows signs of a top. The best chart pattern to short is one in which a stock breaks

Chunk 3498 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
out on the upside of its third or fourth base and then fails. The stock should be breaking down 
toward the low end of its previ ous base pattern on increased volum e. After the first serious price 
break below the base, there will usually be several pullback attempts. The prior base will now 
provide an area of overhead  supply, as all investor s who bought in that zone  will be losing money, 
and a number of them will be eager to get out near breakeven. Therefore, pullbacks to failed price

Chunk 3499 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
bases also provide good timing for short sales. 
Does the element of unlimited risk pres ent any special problem in short selling? 
No, because I never take unlimited risk. If a shor t position goes against me, I will be out after the 
first 6 or 7 percent loss. Before you sell any stoc k short, you should decide the price at which you 
will cover that short position if a loss occurs. 
Besides the CANSLIM formula, whic h is critical to you r stock selection process, risk control

Chunk 3500 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
obviously plays an important role in your ov erall strategy. Can you ta lk a little bit more 
about that element of trading? 
My philosophy is that all stocks are bad. There are no good stoc ks unless they go up in price. If 
they go down instead, you have to cut your losses fast. The secret for winning in the stock market 
does not include being right all the time. In fact , you should be able to win even if you are right

Chunk 3501 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
only half the time. The key is to lose the l east amount of money possi ble when you are wrong. I 
make it a rule never to lose more than a maximum of 7 percent on any stock I buy. If a stock drops 
7 percent below my purchase pri ce, I will automatica lly sell it at the market—no second-guessing, 
no hesitation. 
Some people say, "I can't sell that stock because I'd be taking a loss. " If the stock is below the price

Chunk 3502 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
you paid for it, selling doesn't give you the loss; you already have it. Letting losses run is the most 
serious mistake made by most investors. The p ublic doesn't really und erstand the philosophy of 
cutting losses quickly. If you don't ha ve a rule like cutting a loss at 7 percent, then in bear markets 
like 1973-74, you can lose 70 or 80 percent on your  holdings. I have seen people go bankrupt in

Chunk 3503 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that type of situation. If you ar en't willing to cut your losses short, then you probably should not 
buy stocks. Would you drive your car without brakes? 
In my book, I repeat a story told by Fred C. Kelly, the author of Why You Win or Lose, that 
provides the best example I know of how the typi cal investor procrastinates when it comes to 
making a selling decision. A man has rigged up a turkey  trap with a trail of corn leading into a big

Chunk 3504 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
box with a hinged door. The man holds a long piece of twine, connected to th e door, that he can use 
to pull the door shut once enough turkeys have wa ndered into the box. However, once he shuts the 
door, he can't open it again wit hout going back to the box, whic h would scare away any turkeys 
lurking on the outside. 
One day, he had a dozen turkeys in his box. Then one walked out, leaving eleven. "I should have

Chunk 3505 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
pulled the string when there were twelve inside," he thought, "but maybe if I wait, he will walk 
back in." While he was waiting fo r his twelfth turkey to return, two more turkeys walked out. "I 
should have been satisfied with th e eleven," he thought. "If just one of them walks back, I will pull 
the string." While he was waiting, three more turk eys walked out. Eventual ly, he was left empty-
handed. His problem was that he couldn't give up th e idea that some of the original turkeys would

Chunk 3506 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
return. This is the attitude of the typical investor  who can't bring himself to sell at a loss. He keeps 
expecting the stock to recover. The moral is: To reduce your stock mark et risk, stop counting 
turkeys.  112OK, you use your CANSLIM methodology for sele cting stocks, and your 7 percent rule for 
getting out if you are wrong. How do you decide  when to liquidate a winning stock position?

Chunk 3507 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
First, you should hold a stoc k as long as it is performing properl y. Jesse Livermore said, "It is never 
your thinking that makes big money, it's the si tting." Second, you have to realize that you will 
never sell the exact top. Therefore,  it is ridiculous to  kick yourself when a stock goes higher after 
you sell. The goal is to make substantial profits  on your stocks and not be upset if the price 
continues to advan ce after you get out.

Chunk 3508 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
continues to advan ce after you get out. 
Your writings express disdain for a number of factors that many people consider important, 
including P/E ratios, dividends, diversificatio n, and overbought/oversold indicators. Could 
you explain what you think is wrong with the conventional wisdom regarding these subjects. 
Let's start with P/E ratios. 
To say that a stock is undervalue d because it is selli ng at a low P/E ratio is nonsense. In our

Chunk 3509 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
research, we found there was a very low correlati on between the P/E ratio and the best-performing 
stocks. Some of these stocks had P/E ratios of 10 when they started their ma jor advance; others had 
P/E ratios of 50. During the thir ty-three years in our survey pe riod [1953-1985], th e average P/E 
ratio for the best-performing stocks at their earl y emerging stage was 20, compared to an average 
P/E ratio of 15 for the Dow Jones Average during the same time. At the end of their expansion

Chunk 3510 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
phase, these stocks had an average P/E ratio of a pproximately 45. This means that if, in the past, 
you were not willing to buy stocks with above-average P/Es, you auto matically eliminated most of 
the best-performing securities. 
A common mistake a lot of investors make is to  buy a stock solely becau se the P/E ratio looks 
cheap. There is usually a very good reason why a P/E ratio is low. Many years ago, when I was first

Chunk 3511 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
beginning to study the market, I bought  Northrop at four times earnings  and watched in disbelief as 
the stock eventually declin ed to two times earnings. 
Another common mistake is selling stocks with high P/E ratios. I still remember in 1962 when an 
investor barged into my friend' s brokerage office, declaring in  a loud voice that Xerox was 
drastically overpriced because it  was selling at fifty times earn ings. He went short at $88. Xerox

Chunk 3512 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
eventually went to $1,300, adjusting for stock splits. 
Your thoughts on dividends? 
There is no correlation between divi dends and a stock's performance, hi fact, the more a company 
pays in dividends, the weaker their posture becaus e they may have to pay high interest rates to 
replace funds paid ou t in dividends. It is naiv e to hold stocks that are going down because they pay 
dividends. If you are getting a 4 percent dividend and the stock goes down 25 percent, your net

Chunk 3513 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
yield is a 21 percent loss. 
How about overbought/oversold indicators? 
I rarely pay any attention to overbought/oversold indicators. I once hired a well-known professional 
who specialized in such technical indicators. At the very point during the 1969 market break when I 
was trying to convince portfolio managers to liquida te stocks and move to cash, he was telling them 
it was too late to sell because his indicators said the market was very overs old. Once his indicators

Chunk 3514 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
were oversold, the market break really accelerated. 
The final item on my list of your most pr ominent conventional wisdom targets is 
diversification. 
Diversification is a hedge for i gnorance. I think you are much bett er off owning a few stocks and 
knowing a great deal about them. By being very selective, you increase your chances of picking 
superior performers. You can also  watch those stocks much more carefully, which is important in 
controlling risk.

Chunk 3515 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
controlling risk. 
How many issues would you advise a typi cal investor to hold at any one time? 
For an investor with $5,000, one or two; $10,000, three or four; $25,000, four or five; $50,000, five 
or six; and $100,000 or more, six or seven. 
Aside from the subjects we have just discussed, is there anythi ng else you consider a major 
public misconception?  113Most investors think that char ts are hocus-pocus. Only about 5 to 10 percent of investors

Chunk 3516 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
understand charts. Even a lot of pr ofessionals are totally ignorant about charts. Just as a doctor 
would be foolish not to use X-rays  and EKGs, investors would be f oolish not to use charts. Charts 
provide valuable information about what is going on that cannot be obtained easily any other way. 
They allow you to follow a huge number of di fferent stocks in an organized manner. 
Earlier, you talked about using volume as a clue that the market averages were topping. Do

Chunk 3517 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
you also use volume as an indica tor in trading individual stocks? 
The volume in a stock is a measure of supply and demand. When a stock is beginning to move into 
new high ground, volume should increase by at least 50 percent over the average daily volume in 
recent months. High volume at a key point is an extrao rdinarily valuable tip-off that a stock is ready 
to move. 
Volume can also be used in a reverse manner. When  prices enter a consolidation after an advance,

Chunk 3518 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
volume should dry up very substantially. In other wo rds, there should be very little selling coming 
into the market. During a consolidation, d eclining volume is gene rally constructive. 
How do you handle a losing streak? 
If you hit a losing streak, and it is not because what you are doing is wrong, that tells you the whole 
market may be going bad. If you have fi ve or six straight losses, you want  to pull back to see if it is 
time to start moving into cash.

Chunk 3519 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
time to start moving into cash. 
The "M" in your CANSLIM formula emphasize s the importance of being out of the 
market—at least on the long side—during majo r bear phases. Since most mutual funds, by 
their very structure, remain he avily invested in stocks throughout both bull and bear 
markets, does this imply that you belie ve mutual funds are a poor investment? 
This is going to surprise you. I think mutual funds  are an absolutely outstanding way to invest. I

Chunk 3520 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
believe that every person should own their own home, own real esta te, and have an individual stock 
account or own mutual funds. Those are the only wa ys you can make any substantial income above 
your salary. Although I think mutual funds are an ex cellent investment, the problem is that most 
people don't know how to handle them. The key to su ccess in mutual funds is to sit and not to 
think. When you buy a fund, you want to be in it fo r 15 years or more. That is how you will make

Chunk 3521 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the really big money. But in order to do that, you need  the courage to sit through three, four, or five 
bear markets. The typical diversified growth stock fund will go up 75 to 100 percent in a bull 
market, but it will decline by only 20 to 30 percent in a bear market. 
So you treat a fund very differently from an individual stock account? 
Very, very differently. With an individual stock, you absolutely ha ve to have a stop-loss point,

Chunk 3522 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
because you never know how far down the stock is going. I remember selling a $100 stock one 
time and it eventually went to $1.1 didn't have any idea it was going down that far, but what would 
have happened if I had held on to it? One mistake like that and you can't come back. 
In contrast, in a mutual fund, you should sit thr ough the bear markets. Since most funds will be 
diversified in 100 or more stocks across the Amer ican economy, when stocks  recover after a bear

Chunk 3523 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
market, these funds will recover as well—they almost have to. Un fortunately, in a bear market, 
most people get scared and decide to switch, ruin ing their long-term holding plan. Actually, when a 
good, diversified growth fund is dow n sharply, you should buy more. 
Would it be fair to say that the general public tends to treat funds like they should individual 
stocks and stocks like th ey should funds? By that I mean, they  tend to hold on to their losers

Chunk 3524 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
in individual stocks, but liquidate their mutual funds when they are down sharply. 
Yes, that is exactly right. Because of the emoti onal element, most of what people do in the market 
is wrong. 
Along that line, what are the biggest  mistakes investors generally make? 
In my book I have a chapter on eighteen common mistakes. 
The following list of common mistakes  is excerpted from O'Neil's book How to Make Money in 
Stocks, published by McGraw-Hill in 1988.

Chunk 3525 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Stocks, published by McGraw-Hill in 1988. 
1. Most investors never get past the starting gate  because they do not use good selection criteria.  114They do not know what to look for to find a succe ssful stock. Therefore, they buy fourth-rate 
"nothing-to-write-home-about" stocks that are not  acting particularly well in the marketplace and 
are not real market leaders. 
2. A good way to ensure miserable results is to b uy on the way down in price; a declining stock

Chunk 3526 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
seems a real bargain because it's cheaper than it was a few months earlier. For example, an 
acquaintance of mine bought Inte rnational Harvester at $19 in March 1981 because it was down in 
price sharply and seemed a great bargain. This wa s his first investment, a nd he made the classic 
tyro's mistake. He bought a stock near its low fo r the year. As it turned out, the company was in 
serious trouble and was headed, at the time, for possible bankruptcy.

Chunk 3527 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
3.An even worse habit is to average down in your  buying, rather than up. If you buy a stock at $40 
and then buy more at $30 and average out your co st at $35, you are following up your losers and 
mistakes by putting good money after bad. This amateur strategy can produce serious losses and 
weigh you down with a few big losers. 
4.The public loves to buy cheap stoc ks selling at low prices per shar e. They incorrectly feel it's

Chunk 3528 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
wiser to buy more shares of stock in round lots of 100 or 1,000 shares, and this makes them feel 
better, perhaps more important. You would be be tter off buying 30 or 50 sh ares of higher-priced, 
sounder com panies. You must think in terms of the number of dollars you are investing, not the 
number of shares you can buy. Buy the best merchandi se available, not the poorest. The appeal of a 
$2, $5, or $10 stock seems irresistible. But most st ocks selling for $10 or lower are there because

Chunk 3529 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the companies have either been in ferior in the past or have had something wrong with them recent-
ly. Stocks are like anything else. You can't buy the best quality at the cheapest price! 
It usually costs more in commissions and markups  to buy low-priced stocks, and your risk is 
greater, since cheap stocks can drop 15 to 20 pe rcent faster than most  higher-priced stocks. 
Professionals and institutions will not normally  buy the $5 and $10 stocks, so you have a much

Chunk 3530 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
poorer grade following and support for these low-quali ty securities. As discussed earlier, institu-
tional sponsorship is one of the ingredients needed to help pr opel a stock higher in price. 
5.First-time speculators want to make a killing in the market. They want too much, too fast, without 
doing the necessary study and preparation or acqui ring the essential methods and skills. They are 
looking for an easy way to make a quick buck without  spending any time or effort really learning

Chunk 3531 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
what they are doing. 
6.Mainstream America delights in buying on tips,  rumors, stories, and advisory service 
recommendations. In other words, they are w illing to risk their hard-earned money on what 
someone else says, rather than on knowing for su re what they are doing themselves. Most rumors 
are false, and even if a tip is correct, the stock ironically will , in many cases, go down in price.

Chunk 3532 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
7.Investors buy second-rate stocks because of divi dends or low price/earnings  ratios. Dividends are 
not as important as earnings per share; in fact, the more a compa ny pays in dividends, the weaker 
the company may be because it may have to pay high interest rates to replenish internally needed 
funds that were paid out in the form of dividends . An investor can lose th e amount of a dividend in

Chunk 3533 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
one or two days' fluctuation in the price of the st ock. A low P/E, of course, is probably low because 
the company's past record is inferior. 
8.People buy company names they are familiar with, names they know. Just because you used to 
work for General Motors doesn't make General Motors necessarily a go od stock to buy. Many of 
the best investments will be names you won't k now very well but could and should know if you 
would do a little studying and research.

Chunk 3534 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
would do a little studying and research. 
9.Most investors are not able to find good inform ation and advice. Many, if they had sound advice, 
would not recognize or follow it. The average friend, stockbroker, or advisory service could be a 
source of losing advice. It is al ways the exceedingly small minority  of your friends, brokers, or 
advisory services that are successf ul enough in the market themselves  that merit your consideration.

Chunk 3535 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Outstanding stockbrokers or advisory services ar e no more frequent than are outstanding doctors, 
lawyers, or baseball players. On ly one out of nine baseball play ers that sign professional contracts 
ever make it to the big leagues. And, of course, the majority of ballplayers that graduate from 
college are not even good enough to  sign a professional contract, 
10. Over 98 percent of the masses ar e afraid to buy a stoc k that is beginning to go into new high

Chunk 3536 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
ground, pricewise. It just seems too high to them . Personal feelings and opinions are far less  115accurate than markets. 
11.The majority of unskilled inve stors stubbornly hold onto their lo sses when the losses are small 
and reasonable. They could get out cheaply, but be ing emotionally involved and human, they keep 
waiting and hoping until their loss gets mu ch bigger and costs them dearly.

Chunk 3537 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
12. In a similar vein, investors cash in small, easy-to -take profits and hold their losers. This tactic is 
exactly the opposite of correct investment procedure.  Investors will sell a st ock with a profit before 
they will sell one with a loss. 
13.Individual investors worry too much about taxes and commissions . Your key objective should 
be to first make a net profit. Excessive worryin g about taxes usually leads to unsound investments

Chunk 3538 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
in the hope of achieving a tax sh elter. At other times in the pa st, investors lost a good profit by 
holding on too long, trying to get a long-term capit al gain. Some investors, even erroneously, 
convince themselves they can't sell becau se of taxes—strong ego, weak judgment. 
Commission costs of buying or sel ling stocks, especially through a di scount broker, are a relatively 
minor factor, compared to more important aspects such as making the right decisions in the first

Chunk 3539 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
place and taking action when needed. One of the great  advantages of owning stock over real estate 
is the substantially lower commi ssion and instant marketability and liquidity. This enables you to 
protect yourself quickly at a low co st or to take advant age of highly profitable new trends as they 
continually evolve. 
14.The multitude speculates in options  too much because they think it is a way to get rich quick.

Chunk 3540 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
When they buy options, they incorrectly concentrat e entirely in shorter-term,  lower-priced options 
that involve greater volatility and risk rather than in longer-term options. The limited time period 
works against short-term option holders. Many options  speculators also write what are referred to 
as "naked options," which are nothing but taking a great risk for a potentially small reward and, 
therefore, a relatively uns ound investment procedure.

Chunk 3541 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
15.Novice investors like to put price limits on thei r buy-and-sell orders. They rarely place market 
orders. This procedure is poor because the investor  is quibbling for eighths and quarters of a point, 
rather than emphasizing the more important and la rger overall movement. Li mit orders eventually 
result in your completely missing the market and not  getting out of stocks that should be sold to 
avoid substantial losses.

Chunk 3542 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
avoid substantial losses. 
16.Some investors have trouble making decisions to buy or sell. In other words, they vacillate and 
can't make up their minds. They are unsure because  they really don't know what they are doing. 
They do not have a plan, a set of principles, or rules to guide them  and, therefore, are uncertain of 
what they should be doing. 
17.Most investors cannot look at stocks objectivel y. They are always hoping and having favorites,

Chunk 3543 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
and they rely on their hopes and personal opinions ra ther than paying attention to the opinion of the 
marketplace, which is more frequently right. 
18.Investors are usually influenced by things that are not  really crucial, such as stock splits, 
increased dividends, news announcements, and br okerage firm or advisory recommendations. 
As someone who has spent a lifetime research ing stocks and the Am erican economy, do you

Chunk 3544 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
have any opinions about the quality of research provided by Wall Street firms? 
An article in Financial World found that top-rated analysts ge nerally un-derperformed the S&P 
average. One major problem is that 80 percent of brokerage firm research is written on the wrong 
companies. Each industry analyst has to turn out his or her quot a of reports, even though only a few 
industry groups are leaders in each cycle. There is insufficient screening to determine which reports

Chunk 3545 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
should actually be written. Another major problem with Wall Street research  is that it seldom 
provides sell recommendations. 
I would assume, given the consistency of your su ccess as a stock investor for over twenty-five 
years, that you don't think very much of the random walk theory. 
The stock market is neither efficient nor random . It is not efficient because there are too many 
poorly conceived opinions; it is not random because  strong investor emotions can create trends.

Chunk 3546 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
In the most general sense, trading success requi res three basic components: an effective trade 
selection process, risk control, and discipline  to adhere to the first two items. William O'Neil 
provides a perfect illustration of  the successful trader. He has devised a specific strategy for  116selecting stocks (CANSLIM) , he has a rigorous risk control rale , and he has the discipline not to

Chunk 3547 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):

  117David Ryan-Stock Investment as a Treasure Hunt 
David Ryan does not believe in buying low-priced stocks. But that was not  always the case. He

Chunk 3548 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
remembers flipping through the Wall Street Journal when he was thirteen years old a nd finding a 
$1 stock. He ran with the paper in  hand to his father and asked, "I f I go up to my room and get a 
dollar, can I buy this stock?" His fa ther told him that it didn't quite  work that way. "You have to do 
some research about a company before you invest in the stock," he explained. 
A few days later, leafing through the Wall Street Journal again, Ryan found an article on Ward

Chunk 3549 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Foods, which made Bit-O-Honey and Chunky candy ba rs. It seemed like a perfect investment, 
since he ate a lot of candy. His father set up an account for him, and he bought ten shares of the 
stock. He recalls getting all his friends to buy the candy bars  so the company would make more 
money and his stock would go up. That was the offici al start of Ryan's career  as a stock investor. 
Ryan's interest in the stock market increased as he grew older. By the time he was sixteen years

Chunk 3550 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
old, he was subscribing to a weekly chart serv ice and attending investment seminars by William 
O'Neil and other market analysts. In college, he r ead every book on the stock market he could find. 
William O'Neil was Ryan's idol. After graduating coll ege in 1982, he decided to try to get a job at 
O'Neil's company. He told the receptionist of his interest in O'Neil's work  and his willingness to

Chunk 3551 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
accept any job, no matter how menial, just to get his foot in the door. He was even willing to work 
for free. Ryan was hired, and within four years, hi s investment success led to his appointment as the 
youngest vice-president of the company, with re sponsibilities as a portf olio manager and as 
O'Neil's direct assistant in stock selection for institutional clients. 
Ryan achieved a degree of fame in his own regard when he won the 1985 stock division of the U.S.

Chunk 3552 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Investing Championship, a contest ran by former St anford University Professor Norm Zadeh. His 
return that year was a phenomenal 161 percent. As  if to demonstrate that  his performance was no 
one-year fluke, Ryan reentered the contest in 1986, virtually duplicating his previous year's 
performance with a 160 percent return second-pl ace finish. In 1987, he won the contest once again 
with another triple-digit return  year. For the three years as a whole, his compounded return was a

Chunk 3553 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
remarkable 1,379 percent. 
Although most of the traders I interviewed have  a love for trading, none have the unbridled 
enthusiasm demonstrated by Ryan. To Ryan, the whol e process of stock selection is like a terrific 
game—a treasure hunt as he descri bes it—and he still can't believe he is getting paid to do it. 
The offices of the traders I interviewed ranged from the unadorned to the elaborate, but Ryan

Chunk 3554 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
clearly had the low end of the spectrum staked out. Instead of an office, plain or otherwise, I was 
surprised to find Ryan's workplac e to be a cubicle within a nois y, floor-sized room. Ryan didn't 
seem to care about the lack of am enities. I suspect that as long as he was suppl ied with his charts 
and computer runs, he would probably be  content to work in a hall closet. 
Did your original job at William O'Ne il & Co. involve any market analysis?

Chunk 3555 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
No, but once I was in, I just  started studying and studying. 
On your own time, I take it 
Yes. I would take stuff home every night and on weekends. 
What kind of things were you studying? 
I would go over our charts. I studied the company' s past recommendations. I studied historical 
models of great winning stocks to ingrain in my mind what a stock looke d like before it made a 
major move. I tried to get to the point where I wa s looking at the exact same things O'Neil did. He

Chunk 3556 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
was my role model. 
Were you trading at this time? 
Yes, I opened a $20,000 account shortly after I started working for the company [1982]. 
How did you do? 
Initially, I ran the account up to about $52,000 by June 1983. Then  I gave it all back, including 
some of my starting capital. By  mid-1984, my account was down to $16,000. 
Do you know what you did wrong?

Chunk 3557 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Do you know what you did wrong? 
Yes. I sat down and studied every mistake that I had made from June 1983 through the middle of  1181984. Probably my biggest mistake was that even t hough we were in a moderate bear market—the 
Dow came down from 1,296 to 1,078—I continued to pl ay as aggressively as I had during the bull 
market from August 1982 through June 1983.1 also made the mistake of buying stocks that were

Chunk 3558 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
overextended. By that I mean I was buying stocks that had already moved 15 to 20 percent above 
their price bases. You should only bu y stocks that are within a few pe rcent of their base; otherwise, 
the risk is too great. 
I turned it around by learning from a ll the mistakes that I had made . In late 1984,1 sold a piece of 
real estate I owned and put al l the money in a stock account. 
Were you confident, despite your poor performance during mid-1983 to mid-1984, because

Chunk 3559 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
you felt that you had figured out what you were doing wrong? 
Yes, because I had studied very hard and was determined to be disciplined, I thought I was going to 
do very well. So in 19851 entered the U.S. Inves ting Championship. I won th e stock division that 
year with a 161 percent return, I reentered the contest in subsequent years and substantially 
exceeded 100 percent returns in 1986 and 1987 as well. I was doing the exact same thing over and

Chunk 3560 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
over again. I was buying stocks when they  had all the characteristics I liked. 
How are you doing this year [May 1988]? 
So far this year, I am down. We are in a different type of market: Stocks ar en't moving as quickly 
as they have in the last three years. I am playing with a much smaller amount this year, because I 
think the potential for making a lot of money is much more limited. 
You mentioned earlier that for a while you rea d virtually every book  on the markets you

Chunk 3561 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
could find. What reading list would you give to  someone starting out who is serious about 
becoming a successful stock trader? 
Essential reading on top of the list is O'Neil's book, How to Make Money in Stocks (McGraw-Hill, 
New York, NY 1988). Another book that is must reading is How I Made Two Million Dollars in the 
Stock Market by Nicholas Darvas (Lyle Stuart, Inc., S ecaucus, NJ, 1986). A lot of people laugh at

Chunk 3562 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that title, but it is fun reading and you l earn a ton. Another book I would recommend is 
Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefevre [reputedly  about Jesse Livermore]. 
Livermore himself wrote a very good thin volume, How to Trade in Stocks (Institute for Economic 
& Financial Research, Albuquerque, NM, 1986). 
Any others? 
A good one on what to look for in individual stocks is Super Performance Stocks by Richard Love

Chunk 3563 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
(Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1977). The book has a great study on some of the greatest 
winners of all time. Another good one on picking stocks is Profile of a Growth Stock by Kermit 
Zieg and Susannah H. Zieg (Investor's Inte lligence, Larchmont, NY, 1972). I would also 
recommend Marty Zweig's book, Winning on Wall Street (Warner Books, Inc., New York, NY, 
1986) and Stan Weinstein's Secrets for Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets (Dow, Jones-Irwin, New

Chunk 3564 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
York, NY, 1988), which has some good sections on short selling. Finally, on Elliott Wave analysis, 
which I think has some validity, there is Elliott Wave Principle by Frost and Prechter (New Classic 
Library, Inc., Gainesville , GA, 1978) and a book called Super Timing by an English fellow named 
Beckman (Milestone Publishers, London). 
All those books are good, but you lear n the most from the market itse lf. Every time I buy a stock, I

Chunk 3565 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
write down the reasons why I bought it [he pulls out a binder contai ning annotated charts]. Doing 
this helps cement in my mind the characteristics of a winning stock. Maybe even more important, it 
helps me learn from my mistakes. 
What kind of things did you lear n by keeping your trader's diary? 
Not buying overextended stocks, using О'Neil's criteria for stock selection, and being as disciplined

Chunk 3566 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
as possible. The more disciplined you can get,  the better you are going to do in the market. The 
more you listen to tips and rumors, the more money you're likely to lose. 
Has keeping this diary been an important part of your success? 
Absolutely. 
Can you describe your proce dure for selecting stocks?  119I start out by going through the stock charts a nd writing down the stocks with strong technical 
action. In other words, I write down all the stocks 
I want to take a closer look at.

Chunk 3567 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I want to take a closer look at. 
Your company follows 7,000 stocks; you can't possi bly look at 7,000 charts on a regular basis. 
I don't look through 7,000, but in a week I probably go through about 4,000 charts. So, I see a 
majority of the data base. Keep in mind ther e are probably about 1,500 to 2,000 stocks that trade 
under $ 10, and I don't like to look at those anyway. 
Is that a good rule: Avoid stocks under $10? 
Yes, because they are usually down there for a reason.

Chunk 3568 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Doesn't that knock out a lot of the OTC stocks? 
Yes, a lot of the smaller OTC stocks. 
But aren't those sometimes the best buys—the stoc ks that no one is paying any attention to? 
Sometimes. But many of thos e stocks stay down there for years a nd years. I would rather wait until 
they prove themselves by moving up to the $15 to $20 range. 
After you have reviewed the charts and written down the stocks that interest you, what do 
you look at next to screen your selection?

Chunk 3569 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
you look at next to screen your selection? 
I look at the five-year ea rnings growth record and the last two quarters of ea rnings relative to the 
previous year's levels. The quarterly comparison s show you if there is any deceleration in the 
earnings growth rate. For example, a 30 percent grow th rate over the last five years may look very 
impressive, but if in the last two quarters earni ngs were only up 10 percent and 15 percent, it warns

Chunk 3570 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
you that the strong growth period  may be over. Of course, t hose two factors—the five-year 
earnings growth record and th e earnings during the past two quarters—are combined in our 
earnings per share (EPS) rank. [See the O'Neil chapter for a detailed explanation of the EPS.] 
What are you looking for in an EPS figure? 
As high as possible—at least above 80, and preferably above 90. Actually, a lot of stocks I buy 
have an EPS rank of 99.

Chunk 3571 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
have an EPS rank of 99. 
In my experience, markets usually anticipate. One thing that surprises me about the EPS is 
that I would think that the price of the stoc k would run up well before the earnings growth 
starts to be extremely positive. 
That is what a lot of people think. They say, "It's too late to buy the stock; the earnings are already 
on the table." However, in analyzing hundreds of the biggest winners, we found that, in many 
cases, the earnings had been on the table for a while.

Chunk 3572 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
What would cause a stock to just sit despite very good earnings? 
The broad stock market may be weak and holding b ack the stock, but once the weight of the market 
comes off, these stocks just go right through the roof. 
How about if the stock market is  OK? What would keep the stock from taking off in that type 
of situation? 
Perceptions—people might not believ e that the earnings are going to continue as strongly as they 
had in the past.

Chunk 3573 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
had in the past. 
What else are you using besides the EPS and the earnings breakdown to screen your stock 
selections? 
The relative strength is very important. [The relative strength  ranks a stock's price change relative 
to all other stocks survey ed. See the O'Neil chapter for a detailed definition.] 
What are you looking for in relative strength? 
At least above 80, and preferably above 90.  
Intuitively, I would almost think that—

Chunk 3574 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Intuitively, I would almost think that— 
"It has already gone too far. It can't get any stronger." 
Well, not necessarily that it can't get any stro nger, but it seems to me that, by definition,  120every stock has to have a high relative stren gth when it tops. How do you avoid sometimes 
buying the highs, if you are restricting you rself to high relati ve strength stocks? 
I am usually able to avoid that because in my firs t step of screening the ch arts, I generally rale out

Chunk 3575 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
stocks that are overextended from  their base. Very often the stoc ks with the highest relative 
strength continue to outperform the market for months and months. For ex ample, Microsoft had a 
relative strength of 97 when it was at $50 a share. It eventually moved to $161. 
Are you implying that the higher the relative strength the better? 
Yes, I would rather go with a relative strength of  99 than 95. However, once the relative strength 
starts falling off, I usually get out of the stock.

Chunk 3576 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
So you are not only paying attention to the relative strength value itself, but also the trend of 
the relative strength. 
Right. If the relative strength starts breaking an up trend, then I would be very cautious, even if it is 
still well above 80. 
Am I going in the right order, EPS to relative strength, in terms of how you filter down your 
initial stock list? 
I would probably place relative st rength first, then EPS. Many times the relative strength takes off

Chunk 3577 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
before that big earnings report comes out. 
Do you also use the relative strength of the industry as a filter in your stock selection? 
Yes. Investor's Daily ranks industry groups between 0 and 200.1 usually want the industry group to 
be in the top 50. 
To continue the screening process, after checki ng the stock's relative strength, the EPS, and 
the industry relative strength, what is your next step?

Chunk 3578 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I check the number of shares outstanding. I am looking for stocks with less than thirty million 
shares and preferably only five to ten million shar es. Stocks with more than thirty million shares 
are more mature; they have alre ady split a few times. It is a case of supply and demand: Because 
you have more supply, it takes a lot more money to move those stocks. 
What else do you look at? 
You want some institutional ownership, because they really power a stock higher, but you don't

Chunk 3579 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
want too much sponsorship. I would say 1 percen t to 20 percent mutual fund sponsorship is the 
ideal range. 
Are there any other important elements that  go into the stock selection process? 
Yes. There should be something new that attracts  people to that stock. For example, Reebok had 
shoes that were hot. Compaq ha d a fantastic portable computer. Microsoft was a leader in the 
software field. 
Doesn't that rule out most companie s that have been around for a while?

Chunk 3580 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yes. You don't want to be playing General Electric  because there is usually  nothing rea lly hot or 
brand new going on. Occasionally, there are exceptions. For example, General Motors has gone 
virtually sideways for the last five  years, and it looks like they are trying to turn their situation 
around. 
With General Motors, might the "new" be the recent shift to high styling? 
Yes, but in most cases, you are going to find the new in emerging entrepreneurial growth 
companies.

Chunk 3581 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
companies. 
I would imagine if you go through 7,000 stocks, th ere must be quite a large number that meet 
your criteria. 
On average, there are probably only  about seventy stocks that meet the criteria, becau se it is tough 
to meet all the conditions. Then I cut those seventy down to about seven. 
How do you cut down from seventy to seven? 
I pick those stocks that have al l the characteristics plus a great-l ooking base pattern.  I also look at

Chunk 3582 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
how the stock has done in the past. For example, ha s the stock doubled before? A lot of the stocks I  121buy have already doubled and tripled before I buy them. 
You actually prefer to buy a stock that has already  doubled as opposed to a stock that is in a 
long base? 
Yes, because that shows me there is something ve ry unusual going on, and if the situation is that 
good, a doubling may just be the beginning. It is probably going to double again. To sum it up, I am

Chunk 3583 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
looking for the strongest stocks in  the market, in terms of both ear nings and the technical picture. 
Since you use an extremely rigorous selection process, do you have a high percentage of 
winners in your stock picks? 
No, only about 50/50, because I cut the losers very quickly. The maximum loss I allow is 7 percent, 
and usually I am out of a losing st ock a lot quicker. I make my mone y on the few stocks a year that

Chunk 3584 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
double and triple in price. The profits in those trades easily make up for all the small losers. 
How long do you typically hold a stock? 
I usually hold my big winners for about six to twel ve months, stocks that aren't that strong about 
three months, and my losers less than two weeks. 
Do you pick an objective on the stocks you buy? 
No. I usually wait until the stock runs up, builds a nother base, and then breaks down. That is when 
I liquidate.

Chunk 3585 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I liquidate. 
Do you think people should only use market orders? 
In a dull market that is just trading back and fo rth, you could put in a limit order. But if you really 
think the stock is going to make a big move—and that should be the only reason you are buying the 
stock to begin with—then there is  no reason to haggle over an eight h of a point. Just buy the stock. 
The same thing applies to the downside; if you think the stock is going to drop, just sell it.

Chunk 3586 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I learned the lesson about market orders in 1982 when I was trying to buy Textone, which was 
trading at $15, for $14%. The next day it jumped llh points, and I couldn't bring myself to buy the 
stock at $16k when I could have bought it at $15 a day ear lier. That stock eventually went to $45. 
One element of your trading styl e is buying a stock when it makes a new high. Wouldn't the 
fundamental screening conditions you use have  been in place well before that point?

Chunk 3587 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
In some cases, they might have been. But I am  trying to buy a stock when you have the most 
chance of making money. When a stock is coming o ff the low end of a base  back to the high end, 
there will be a lot of people who bought it near the highs and sat with a loss for months. Some of 
those people are going to be happy to  get out at even, and that crea tes a lot of overhead resistance. 
So, a stock which is at new highs has much more of an open running field?

Chunk 3588 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Right, because no one ahead of yo u is at a loss and wants to ge t out at the fi rst opportunity. 
Everybody has a profit; everybody is happy. 
But the downside of that is if you wait for a b reakout to new highs, a lot of times the market 
will pull back into the trading range. Ho w do you avoid getting whipsawed in those 
situations? 
You can tell a lot by the volume. If the volume doubl es one day and the stock moves to a new high,

Chunk 3589 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
it is telling you a lot of people are in terested in the stock and buying it. 
So volume becomes very important as a filt ering process to avoid getting whipsawed. 
Yes. If the stock moves to new high ground, but the volume is only up 10 percent, I would be wary. 
Do you buy it the first day the stock breaks out to new highs, or do you wait for it to 
consolidate for a few days? 
I want to buy it as soon as it goes to new highs.

Chunk 3590 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
If you buy a stock at new highs and it then pulls back  into the range, at  what point do you 
decide it was a false breakout? For example, assume a stock that has been trading between 
$16 and $20 goes to $21 and you buy it. What do you do if two days later the stock is back to 
$19? 
If it reenters its base, I have a rule to cut at least 50 percent of the position.  122If it reenters its base at all? Do you mean even if  it is just below the top end of the base, or do

Chunk 3591 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
you require some minimum penetration? 
No, if it just reenters the base. In some cases, it w ill break out and come back to the top of the base, 
but not reenter. That's fine, and I will stay with the stock. But if the top of the base was $20 and it 
breaks back to $193A, I want to sell at least half of the position because the stock didn't keep on 
moving. Frequently, when a stock dr ops back into its base, it goe s all the way back down to the

Chunk 3592 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
lower end of the base. In the example, if it goe s from $21 down to $19X it wi ll often go all the way 
back down to $16. Therefore, you wa nt to cut your losses quickly. 
From a technical perspective, is the price goi ng back into the base a bearish indicator? 
Yes. Stocks should be at a profit the first day you buy them. In fact, having a profit on the first day 
is one of the best indicators that you are going to make money on the trade.

Chunk 3593 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Do you use the table in Investor's Daily that lists the stocks with the greatest percentage 
increase in volume relative to the pa st fifty-day average volume levels? 
Yes, I use it to help spot stocks that  are just about ready to take off.  
Are you using it to verify stocks  you have already picked out? 
Yes. After I have done my weekly screen to select  the stocks I am interest ed in buying, I sometimes 
wait for the stock to hit that column as a timing signal.

Chunk 3594 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Can you elaborate on using volume as a trading tool? 
When a stock that has been moving up starts consolidating, you want to see volume dry up. You 
should see a downtrend in volume. Then when volum e starts picking up again, it usually means the 
stock is ready to blast off. 
So, in the consolidation phase, decreasing volume is good. If you continue to see very high 
volume, do you start thinking potential top?

Chunk 3595 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
volume, do you start thinking potential top? 
Yes, because that shows that a lot of people are ge tting out of the stock. You want an increase in 
volume when the stock breaks out, but you want a d ecrease in volume as the stock consolidates. 
Any other volume signals you look for? 
When the market, or a stock, is bottoming, you want  to see increased volume combined with an 
absence of further price progress on the downside. For example, if  the Dow declines from 2,200 to

Chunk 3596 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
2,100, trades down to 2,085 the next day, and then closes higher on increased volume, it 
demonstrates support. It suggests that  there are a lot of buyers coming in. 
The screens you have described in selectin g stocks are essentially O'Neil's CANSLIM 
methodology. [See the O'Neil chapter for definiti on.] Did you add any of your own elements 
to his approach? 
Yes, I learned that most of our  greatest winning recommendations  started off with prices under

Chunk 3597 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
thirty times earnings. О'Nell says the P/E [price/earnings] ratio is not important. I think it is, in that 
your success ratio is a lot highe r on lower P/E ratio stocks. 
But I guess not too low P/E ratios? 
When I'm talking about lower P/E ratio stocks, I mean  stocks that have a P/E ratio that is between 
even and up to two times the S&P 500 P/E ratio. So if the S&P 500 is at fifteen times earnings, you

Chunk 3598 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
should try to buy stocks with P/E ratios be tween 15 and 30. Once you start going much beyond 
double the S&P 500 P/E ratio level, your timing has to be more exact. You are bound to make a 
few more mistakes on higher P/E ratio stocks. 
Do you therefore avoid high P/E ratio stocks? 
Yes, in many cases I do. The most profitable s ituation is when you find a stock with a strong 
earnings trend that is trading at a P/E ra tio in line with the broad market ratio.

Chunk 3599 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
If you avoid high P/E ratio stocks, wouldn't that have prevented you from catching the whole 
biomedical group move?  
That was a little different because of the fact that the whole group was trading at high P/E ratios. 
Does that imply that there should be an exception made for a new industry?  123Yes, you don't want to be absolu tely rigid with these rules. 
Has the basic market behavior stayed the same in the 1980s versus the 1970s and the 1960s?

Chunk 3600 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yes, the same types of stocks work time after time. It hasn't changed at all. We can take one of the 
greatest winning stocks from 1960 and line it up w ith one of the best stocks in 1980 and they are 
going to have exactly the same characteristics. 
Do you have any thoughts on the subject of short selling? 
I need more time to study it and more experience. Howe ver, to pick a short, I think you need to flip

Chunk 3601 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
all these characteristics we were talking about . Instead of a good growth record, you should look 
for a poor five-year growth record and quarterly earnings that are decelerat ing. The stock should be 
losing relative strength, breaking uptrends, and starting to hit new lows. 
Do you think that short selling may be a criti cal element for superior performance if we go 
into a long bear market?

Chunk 3602 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
into a long bear market? 
Yes, I think it would help. But, Bill  O'Neil will tell you that shorting is about three times as hard as 
buying stocks. Bill says he has made substantial mone y in only two of the pa st nine bear markets. 
He thinks the best thing you can do in  a bear market is just sit it out. 
How do you recognize a bear market before it's too late? 
By how well my individual stocks are doing. If, during the bull phase, the leaders start losing, it

Chunk 3603 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
indicates that a bear market is de veloping. If I have five or six st ocks in a row that get stopped out, 
a caution flag goes up. 
What else do you look for to signal a bear market? 
Divergence between the Dow and the daily advance/decline line [a graph of the cumulative net 
difference between the number of New York Stock Exchange stocks advanci ng each day versus the 
number declining]. The advance/decline tends to  top out a few months before the Dow does. 
Did that happen in 1987?

Chunk 3604 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Did that happen in 1987? 
The advance/decline topped out during the first qua rter of 1987, well before the stock market peak 
in August. 
Were you looking for a top because of that? 
Not at that point, because a lot of the individual st ocks were still doing very well. The big clue that 
the market was really topping was after the Dow ca me off its high at 2,746, there was a very feeble, 
low-volume rally, and then the market got hit for a nother 90-point loss. At that juncture, I decided

Chunk 3605 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
it was time to move out of the market. 
Because the rally was on low volume? 
Yes, and the fact that there were very few stocks that participated in the rally; the advance/decline 
line did not move as high as it did on the previous rally. Also, in late August, the discount rate was 
raised for the first time in three years. I think that really stabbed the market. 
You haven't been in the business that long. Do you have the confidence that you will be able

Chunk 3606 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to trade successfully almost every year for a long time? 
Yes, because I have established a very defined se t of principles that w ill provide the foundation for 
successful trading for years to come. Also, I plan to never stop learning. 
Do you feel you are getting better as a trader? 
Yes. If you try to learn from every single trad e that you make, you are onl y going to get better and 
better as time goes on. 
Why are you so much more successful  than the typical stock investor?

Chunk 3607 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Because I am doing something that I love to do and find fascinating. After eight or nine hours at 
work, I go home and spend more time on the market s. I have the charts delivered to me on 
Saturdays, and I go through them for three or f our hours on Sunday. I think if you love what you 
are doing, you are going to be a lot more successful. 
A lot of people who invest use their spare ti me to study the market and still have only

Chunk 3608 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
mediocre, or even losing, results.  124That is probably because they have not found a disc iplined system for picking stocks. They read an 
article and say, "That sounds like a good stock, I'll buy it." Or they buy a stoc k because their broker 
recommends it. 
What advice would you give the novice trader? 
The single most important advice I can give anybody is: Learn from your mistakes. That is the only 
way to become a successful trader. 
Any final comments?

Chunk 3609 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Any final comments? 
The greatest thing about the market is that it is always fun to be looking for that next big winner—
trying to find the stock with all the characteristic s that are going to make it have a big move. The 
feeling isn't any different now than when I was only trading 500 shares. There is still the same 
satisfaction of knowing you found a stoc k before it made its big move. 
You make it sound like a game.

Chunk 3610 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
You make it sound like a game. 
It is. To me it is like a giant treasure hunt. Some where in here [he pats the weekly chart book] there 
is going to be a big winner, and I am trying to find it. 
The conventional wisdom about how to make money in stocks is summarized by the semi-facetious 
advice: Buy low and sell high. David Ryan would disagree. His philosophy can  be summarized as: 
Buy high and sell higher. In fact, Ryan usually will not consider buying any stock selling for less 
than $10.

Chunk 3611 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
than $10. 
Ryan's success is basically due to using apre cise methodology and applyi ng great discipline to 
follow it. As Ryan has clearly demonstrated, a tr ading methodology doesn't have to be original to 
be extremely successful. Ryan readily acknowledges that most of his approach has been learned 
directly from the writings and teachings of William O'Neil. With the help of hard work and in-
depth study, he has been able to apply O'Neil' s trading philosophy with great effectiveness.

Chunk 3612 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
When traders deviate from their own rules, they invariably tend to lose. Ryan is no exception. 
During mid-1983 to mid-1984, he witnessed a period of extremely poor performance. He let his 
previous trading success go to his head by repeated ly breaking one of his ow n cardinal rules: Never 
buy an overextended stock [a stock that is trading far above its most recent price base]. The 1983-
1984 experience made a lasting impression on Rya n, and he has not repeated that mistake.

Chunk 3613 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Maintaining a trader's diary is an essential elem ent of Ryan's approach. Every time he buys a stock, 
Ryan annotates the chart with his reasons for buyi ng the stock. Whenever he liquidates or adds to 
an existing position, a new chart is included with updated comments.  This approach has helped 
Ryan reinforce in his mind the key characteris tics of winning stocks. Perhaps, more important, 
reviewing his past entries ha s helped him avoid repeati ng similar trading mistakes.

Chunk 3614 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Ryan's basic approach, like William O'Neil's appr oach, is to buy value and strength. He also 
believes in focusing on the very best stocks as o pposed to diversifying his portfolio. One important 
observation Ryan made, which many other traders may find helpful, is that his best trades are 
usually winners right from the start. Thus, he ha s little reservation about getting out of a losing 
trade quickly. The maximum he will risk on any trad e is a 7 percent price d ecline. A rigid stop-loss

Chunk 3615 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
rule is an essential ingredient to the tr ading approach of many successful traders. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  125Marty Schwartz-Champion Trader 
I interviewed Marty Schwartz at his office after trading hours. I found him to be very opinionated 
and intense about the subject of trading. This inte nsity occasionally spills over into anger when a 
raw nerve is hit (such as program trading). In fact , Schwartz readily admits that he finds anger a

Chunk 3616 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
useful trait in trading. None of  this "going with the market fl ow" philosophy for Schwartz. In his 
view, the marketplace is an arena and other traders are the adversaries. 
I was also struck by Schwartz's dedication to hi s daily work routine. He was doing his market 
analysis when I arrived and continued to run th rough his calculations during our interview. When I 
left that evening, his analysis was still unfinishe d. Although he appeared very tired, I had no doubt

Chunk 3617 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that he would finish his work  that evening. Schwartz has followed his daily work routine 
religiously during the past nine years. 
Schwartz spent a decade losing money on his tradi ng before he found his stride as a remarkably 
successful professional trader. During his earlier year s, he was a well-paid securities analyst, who, 
as he describes it, was always broke because of market losses. Eventually, he changed his trading

Chunk 3618 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
methodology, in the process of transforming hims elf from a repeated loser to an amazingly 
consistent winner. Not only has Schwartz scored e normous percentage gains in every year since he 
turned full-time trader in 1979, but he has done so without ever losing more than 3 percent of his 
equity on a month-end to month-end basis. 
Schwartz trades independently from an office at home. He is proud of the fact that he has no

Chunk 3619 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
employees. Solitary traders of this type, no ma tter how successful, are usually unknown to the 
public. Schwartz, however, has attained a degree of  fame through repeated entries in the U.S. 
Trading Championships, run by Norm  Zadeh, a Stanford University professor. His performance in 
these contests has been nothing short of ast ounding. In nine of the ten four-month trading 
championships he entered (typically with a star ting stake of $400,000), he made more money than

Chunk 3620 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
all the other contestants combined. His average re turn in these nine contests was 210 percent—
nonannualized! (In the one remaining four-month cont est he witnessed a near  breakeven result.) In 
his single entry in a one-year contest, he scored a 781 percent return. Schwartz's entry into these 
contests is his way of telling th e world that he is the best trad er around. In terms of risk/reward 
ratios, he may well be. 
Please start by telling me about your early days.

Chunk 3621 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How far back do you want me to go?  
From whenever you think is appropriate. 
Well it is very relevant to go back to my ch ildhood, quite frankly. Should I lay down on the couch? 
I grew up in New Haven in a family of modest means. I was very hard working. When I was seven 
or eight I would go out with a snow shovel and come back with $10 after a snowstorm. 
Even now, I still put in about tw elve hours a day. I feel uncomfortab le not doing the work; that's

Chunk 3622 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
why I am doing it now as you are sitting here. I calculate a lot of math ematical ratios and 
oscillators, and I post my own charts . My attitude is that I always want to be better prepared than 
someone I'm competing against. The way I prep are myself is by doing my work each night. 
As I grew up, I realized that education was my ticket, probabl y because it was strongly emphasized 
in my family. I studied hard and was an honor student in high school.

Chunk 3623 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I was accepted to Amherst College, which was one of the great experiences  of my life. When I 
went to freshman orientation they said, "Look to your  left and right and real ize that half of you are 
going to be in the top half of th e class and half of you are going to be in the bottom half." Most of 
those who matriculated there, including myself, were  in the top 5 percent of their high school class.

Chunk 3624 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Perceiving that I wasn't going to  be at the top of everything was a difficult first realization. 
It was the first time in my life I ha d to struggle. I even had to get a tutor for calculus because I just 
wasn't getting the concept. But when I finally got  it, when the light bulb clicked on, it was like 
looking at a magnificent painting. I really experienced the joy of l earning and working hard there.

Chunk 3625 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Before, studying was only a means to an end; now, I found that learning itself was a real joy. 
Amherst had a profound influence on me. 
After graduating in 1967,1 was accepted to the Columbia Business School. At the time, the  126government had just ended graduate school militar y deferments. Since I was unhappy at Columbia 
and combat in Vietnam didn't appeal to me, I joined a U.S. Marine Corps reserve unit that was 
recruiting officers.

Chunk 3626 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
recruiting officers. 
You have to be somewhat crazy to be in the Mari nes; it is a very unusual organization. They push 
you to the edge and then rebuild you in their own mold. However, I have developed a great respect 
for that bureaucracy, because throughout the Marine Corps history, they've been consistent in their 
training procedure. As a second li eutenant you have forty-six lives under your control, so you must

Chunk 3627 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
be well skilled. They put you under a lot of pressure. If you couldn't cut the mustard, you didn't get 
the bars. We had an attrition rate that  I believe approached 50 percent. 
I was the only reservist in Offi cers Candidate School in Quantico at that time. There were 199 
regulars who went to Vietnam, but I came home; that  was the deal I made when I was recruited. I 
was also the only Jewish person there, and they weren't too favorably disposed toward Jews. One

Chunk 3628 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
time, the platoon sergeant drew the Star of David on my forehead with a magic marker. I wanted to 
knock the crap out of him, but I figured he didn't really know the historic significance of what it 
meant. I knew he was just trying to find any kind of pressure point that would make me break. The 
hardest thing I had to do was scrub the magic mark er off my forehead. That's a bitch [he laughs]. 
Anyway, I persevered and made it through successfully. I co nsider that a really fine achievement.

Chunk 3629 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The feeling improves as time passes, and you forget the real pain of the experience. 
The rigorous Marine training gave me the confidence to believe that I could perform at levels 
beyond my previous expectations. Just as Am herst had strengthened my mind, the Marines 
strengthened my body. The two expe riences convinced me that I could do almost anything if I 
worked hard enough and provided the groundwork for my successful trading. That's not to say it 
worked right away, because it didn't.

Chunk 3630 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
worked right away, because it didn't. 
After getting out of the Marines, I returned to Co lumbia and held some boring part-time jobs while 
I completed my M.B.A. My first full-time job was as a securities an alyst at Kuhn Loeb. I 
specialized in the health and re tail field, and I stayed there fo r two years. I found that, on Wall 
Street, the best way to receive a pay increase wa s to change jobs. The company you work for never 
wants to pay you as much as a company trying to recruit you.

Chunk 3631 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I left for XYZ in 1972.1 want to leave out the firm's  name and other particulars for reasons that will 
soon become obvious. This proved to  be one of the most difficult periods in my life and career. 
XYZ had thirty analysts, divided into three subgr oups often. Because the research director didn't 
want to work, he had one of the senior analysts of each group review the work of the analysts. The

Chunk 3632 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
policy was that our research reports  would be circulated and critique d by the other analysts within 
the subgroups prior to being sent out. 
I had written a bearish report on hospital management stocks, saying that the industry would 
eventually go to a utility rate of return. As pa rt of the normal routine, the draft was circulated 
among the other analysts, one of whom got drunk one  night on a flight home  from California and

Chunk 3633 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
told a client about my report. He even sent him a copy of the report in progr ess. What right did he 
have to send out my work? The stocks began plum meting prior to the report's release, because the 
client started spreading rumors that a negative report was about to be issued. 
It was a bitter experience. I had to testify for six hours before the New York Stock Exchange. My 
company's counsel told me, "We will represent you, but should our interests diverge at any point,

Chunk 3634 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
we will inform you." 
At the time, did you know what had happened? 
No, I didn't, but I assumed that everything would be all right if I told the truth, which I did. I was 
totally exonerated; the exchange realized I had been set up. The drug analyst eventually confessed 
because an exchange official found out what happe ned by piecing it all together. It was a rotten, 
bitter experience for me, and I was very sour. I shut the door of my office and stopped working. I

Chunk 3635 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
lost the spark, the drive, the desire to succeed. 
What were you doing at that time? 
I was still doing reports, but I didn't have my hear t in it. Besides that whole negative experience, it 
was early 1973, and I felt the mark et was topping out. I had become very interested in technical 
analysis. At the time, the advanc e/decline line had formed a major top many months earlier. I felt  127that the market and the stocks I was covering were going to go down. Still, people wanted to know

Chunk 3636 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
how many widgets a company was selling and at what price. I lost the spirit to write bullish reports, 
because if stock prices are going down, who car es how many widgets are being sold. I was 
covering growth stocks, which in those days sold at forty or fifty times earnings. It was all so 
ridiculous! 
Were you discouraged from writing bearish repor ts? Also, what ever happened to the bearish 
report that was leaked?

Chunk 3637 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
report that was leaked? 
Nobody wrote bearish reports on Wall Street at that  time. I was allowed to  complete the bearish 
report on the hospital management industry, but I don' t believe they ever intended to publish it. Of 
course, after it was leaked, they were forced to  rush it to the printer to save their scalps. 
What eventually happened? 
I lost my job in the bear market and was out of work for four months. That  was a very interesting

Chunk 3638 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
period, because I believe you learn the most thro ugh adversity. I had a bout $20,000, which in those 
days was a lot of money, and I was going to trad e. I found a real lunatic who had developed 
computer programs for trading commodities. At the time, he had to rent time on a monster machine 
to run programs that today you could do on any PC. He was using different moving averages, that 
sort of thing. I put some of my  money in with him, and I lost most of it—along with my dreams of 
glory.

Chunk 3639 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
glory. 
Having dissipated my capital, I decided I had to go back to work. I was in for a shock. Although I 
had been totally honest and fort hright, I was tainted. "Oh, ar en't you the guy who wrote that 
report?" It didn't matter that I had been totally  ethical and exonerated. People don't want to get 
involved with any controversy, even  if it wasn't of your own making. 
A friend of mine helped me get a job at Edward s & Hanly, which, although it was a retail-oriented

Chunk 3640 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
firm, had a group of analysts who became real star s. It was there that I met Bob Zoellner, the 
managing partner of the firm. He was a great, great trader. He almost single-handedly kept the firm 
afloat in 1974 by shorting stocks and making money in the firm's capital account, while they were 
losing money on the operating side. He started his own hedge fund in 1976 and went on to become 
an extraordinary success.

Chunk 3641 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
an extraordinary success. 
I always had a good nose as a securi ties analyst, and it has stood me in good stead. When I noticed 
that the head of research, who ne ver went out to lunch, began going out to lunch regularly, I started 
interviewing for another job. So, when the firm we nt bankrupt in fall 1975, I had another job lined 
up at Loeb Rhoades. 
In 1976,1 met my wife-to-be and she had a profound effect on me. She made me realize that my

Chunk 3642 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
life was not a dress reh earsal; it was the real th ing and I had been sc rewing it up. Although I had 
steadily earned good salaries, I was still almost broke because I c onsistently lost money in the 
market. 
We got married in March 1978. By that time, I wa s working at E. F. Hutton. Being married made 
going on business trips harder and harder. When you ar e twenty-five, seeing friends from college in

Chunk 3643 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
different cities around the country is very exciting, but when you get in your thirties, it gets real 
stale. My wife literally had to push me out  the door when I had to go on these trips. 
I resented what I called the "tap dances," which ma de you feel like a piece of meat. You meet with 
portfolio managers to give them your views on the stocks you follow, so that they will give 
commission business to your firm. On  a typical trip, you might have five appointments in Houston,

Chunk 3644 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
fly to San Antonio for dinner, and then fly to Dallas later that night  to be ready for breakfast the 
next morning. I got sick of it. 
I wanted to have a family, but I felt that I wasn't able to handle it financia lly. I had resisted getting 
married because I was afraid of being tapped out. Bu t, at that point, I wonde red whether it had been 
a self-fulfilling prophecy. People se em to know how to handle failure because they can produce it

Chunk 3645 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
themselves. It almost becomes a negative cause a nd effect cycle, whereby they produce it, they 
know how to handle it, and they wallow in it. 
By mid-1978,1 had been a security analyst for eight years and it had become intolerable. I knew I 
had to do something different. I always knew I wanted to work fo r myself, have no clients, and

Chunk 3646 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
answer to no one. That, to me, was the ultimate goa l. I had been brooding for years, "Why wasn't I  128doing well when I was groomed to be successful?" I decided it was now time to be successful. 
When a brokerage firm wants to hire you, they' ll give you anything. Once you are there, they are 
far less responsive. So, when I was being roman ced by Hutton, I asked for a quote machine in my 
office. I was the only securities analyst that had a quote machine. During my last year at Hutton, I

Chunk 3647 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
started closing the door to my office so that I co uld watch the market. I talked to my friend Bob 
Zoellner several times a day, and he taught me ho w to analyze market action. For example, when 
the market gets good news and goes down, it means the market is very weak; when it gets bad news 
and goes up, it means the market is healthy. 
During that year, I started taking trial subscriptions to a lot of different newsletters. I consider

Chunk 3648 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
myself a synthesizer; I didn't necessarily crea te a new methodology, but  I took a number of 
different methodologies and molded  them into my own approach. 
I found a guy, Terry Laundry, who lived in Nantuc ket and had an unorthodox approach called the 
Magic Т Forecast. He was an МГГ  engineering graduate with a math background, and that 
appealed to me. His basic theory  was that the market spent th e same amount of time going up as 
going down. Only the amplitude was different.

Chunk 3649 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
going down. Only the amplitude was different. 
In my experience, markets come down a lot quick er than they go up. Doesn't that contradict 
the theory? 
The market movement before it goes down may be a distributive process. I call them M-tops. The 
point you use to measure the time element is not  the price high, but an oscillator high, which 
precedes the price high. That, in f act, is a major cornerstone of hi s work. The theory had different

Chunk 3650 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
properties that I learned, and it ha s been extremely helpful to me. 
For the record, what is the name of Laundry's book? 
There is no book. He just extolled his theory through his various ne wsletters. He also had some 
pamphlets. Actually, it was kind of  funny. After I mentioned him in a Barren's article, he got a lot 
of inquiries for his pamphlets. He is a little ecc entric. His response was, "I don't have any copies 
available." He should have prin ted them and made some money.

Chunk 3651 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I developed and synthesized a number of indicators th at I used to determine when the market was at 
a lower-risk entry point. I focused on determin ing mathematicalprobab ilities. Although 
occasionally there are situations where the market goes three standard deviations instead of two, 
based on the likelihood that 98 per cent of the moves will st op at two standard de viations, I'll take 
that bet any day of the week. And, if I am wrong, I am going to use risk control and stop myself out

Chunk 3652 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
X dollars away. That is the most critical element. 
Anyway, I subscribed to all these letters, deve loped a methodology, and trad ed like crazy. By mid-
1979,1 hadrun $5,000 up to $140,000 in just two years. 
When did you turn from a loser to a winner? 
When I was able to separate my ego needs from  making money. When I was able to accept being 
wrong. Before, admitting I was wrong was more upse tting than losing the money. I used to try to

Chunk 3653 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
will things to happen. I figured it  out, therefore it can't be wr ong. When I became a winner, I said, 
"I figured it out, but if I'm wrong, I'm getting the he ll out, because I want to save my money and go 
on to the next trade." By living the philosophy that my winners are always in  front of me, it is not 
so painful to take a loss. If  I make a mistake, so what! 
Did you make a complete transition fr om fundamental to technical analysis?

Chunk 3654 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Absolutely. I always laugh at peopl e who say, "I've never met a rich te chnician." I love that! It is 
such an arrogant, nonsensical response. I used fundamentals for nine years and got rich as a 
technician. 
But you were still doing fundament al analysis as an analyst? 
Yes, to earn a salary. But my wife said to me, "Go out on your own. You're thirty-four and you've 
always wanted to work for yourself. The worst th at can happen is that you '11 go back to doing 
what you were doing before."

Chunk 3655 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
what you were doing before." 
I always pictured myself as being brave, courage ous, and strong, but when it came time to take the 
chance, I was scared out of my mind. I ha d $140,000, of which about $30,000 was tied up in tax 
deals and $92,500 was used to pay for a seat on th e American Stock Exchange. That left me with  129about $20,000 when I went on the floor as a mark et maker. I borrowed $50,000 from my in-laws, 
which gave me $70,000 of working capital.

Chunk 3656 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
which gave me $70,000 of working capital. 
I started off losing in my first tw o days in the business. I got in volved in Mesa Petroleum options 
because Zoellner, whom I profoundly respected, t hought they were significantly undervalued. I 
called him the second day from the floor, "Are you sure you are right?" I must have had a grand 
total of ten options. I was down $1,800 and dying. I wa s petrified because, in my mind, I was down

Chunk 3657 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
almost 10 percent, since I didn't consider my in-l aws' money part of my own working capital. The 
third day, Mesa options started going up and I never looked back. 
After the first four months, I was ahead by $100,000. The next year I earned $600,000. After 
1981,1 never earned less than seven figures. I rememb er talking to a good friend of mine in 1979 
and saying, "I don't think anybody can make $40,000 a month trading options." Now I can do that 
in a day without a problem.

Chunk 3658 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
in a day without a problem. 
You were doing very well on the floor. Why did you leave? 
It was very slow during lunchtime in  those years. I used to go to an upstairs office to eat my lunch. 
While I was at my desk eating a sandwich, I woul d do my charts and look for different ideas. I 
came to realize that I could see much more sitting at  the desk, looking at a machine, than being at a 
post, trading an option. On the floor, the specialists  chose the symbols they wanted to keep on the

Chunk 3659 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
quote machines, because they paid the rent on them. So you always had to run around to find what 
you wanted to see. I felt much  more comfortable upstairs. 
About a year and a half later, af ter I started earning a lot of money, the floor wasn't big enough. 
There was a much bigger arena to play in. Another reason for my m ove was the fact that, in 1981, a 
change in the tax laws made it more lucrativ e to trade futures than stocks and options.

Chunk 3660 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
In my futures trading, I didn't try to make two one year, four the next, eight the next, etc. I didn't 
earn significantly more in my futures trading in 1987 than I did in 1982, because I used my profits 
to invest in real estate and other things to enhan ce the quality of my life. 
I was broke in the 1970s, and I never wanted to  be broke again. My ph ilosophy was that if you 
make money every month, nothing bad is going to happen to you. So, you won't be the richest

Chunk 3661 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
person. You'll never be the richest person anywa y. What difference does it make? I'm proud of my 
futures trading, because I took $40,000 and ran it up to about $20 million with never more than a 3 
percent drawdown. 
Did you continue trading stocks during this period? 
Yes, but with a different mentality. I traded stoc ks from a little longer time horizon. I don't feel the 
same pressure when I own 100,000 shares of stock as when I own 100 S&Ps.

Chunk 3662 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Will you trade stocks as readily from  the short side as the long side? 
No, I find it harder to trade st ocks from the short side.  
Because of the uptick rule? 
No, it is just easier to short the S&P, because you get so much more bang for the buck. Also, I hate 
the specialist system; they are always trying to con you to death. I'll give you my view on 
specialists: Never in my life have I met a less talented group of people who make a

Chunk 3663 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
disproportionately large amount of money relative to their skills. Having the specialist book is the 
most extraordinary advantage one could ever ask fo r. In normal markets, th e specialists can always 
define their risk. If th ey have a bid for 20,000 down \ they can buy the st ock, knowing they can 
always get out'/«lower. So, they are protected. I always tell my friends to have their daughters 
marry the son of a specialist.

marry the son of a specialist. 
I can't stand most established institutions. I ha ve a me-against-them mentality, which I believe

What was your experience during the w eek of the October 19 stock crash? 
I came in long. I have thought about it, and I w ould do the same thing again. Why? Because on

Chunk 3665 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
October 16, the market fell 108 poi nts, which, at the time, was the biggest one-day point decline in 
the history of the stock excha nge. It looked climactic to me, and I thought that was a buying 
opportunity. The only problem was that it was a Friday. Usually a down Friday is followed by a  130down Monday. 
I don't think Monday would have been nearly as ba d as it was, if Treasury Secretary James Baker

Chunk 3666 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
had not started verbally bludgeoning the Germans a bout interest rates over the weekend. He was so 
belligerent. Once I heard Baker, I knew I was dead. 
So, you knew that you were in trouble over the weekend? 
Yes. Also, Marty Zweig, who is a friend of mine, was on "Wall St reet Week" on Friday evening, 
talking about a possible de pression. I called Marty th e next day, and he said  he thought there was

Chunk 3667 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
another 500 points risk in the mark et. Of course, he didn't know it was going to happen in one day. 
What made him so bearish at the time? 
I think his monetary indicators we re terribly negative. Remember, th e bonds were sinking rapidly at 
the time. 
What happened that Monday? When did you get out? 
The high in the S&P on Monday was 269.1 liquidate d my long position at 267'/2.1 was real proud

Chunk 3668 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):

One of the most suicidal tilings you can do in tr ading is to keep adding to a losing position. Had I 
done that, I could have lost $5 million that day. It was painful, and I was bleeding, but I honored 
my risk points and bit the bullet.

That's another example where my Marine training came into play. They teach you never to freeze

The day of the crash, 1 got out of most of my positions and pr otected my family. Then at 1:30 
P.M., with the Dow down 275 points, I went to my  safe deposit box and took my gold out. Half an 
hour later, I went to another bank and started wr iting checks to get my cash out. I started buying 
Treasury bills and preparing for the worst. I had never seen anything like what was going on.

Chunk 3672 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
You were seriously worried about the banks going under? 
Why not? The stories I heard, subs equently, from people on the ope rations side of the business 
would have stopped the hearts of the public if they had known what was going on. The banks 
weren't meeting any of the calls at the brokerage firms. On Tuesday morning, we were within hours 
of the whole thing totally collaps ing. So my caution was well advised.

Chunk 3673 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I think my fear of a depression  is related to my father grad uating college in 1929. If you talk to 
people who got out of college at that time, it is as though a ten-year peri od is missing from their

because I feared it so much. I th ink that is one of the reasons why I don't try to increase my

When did you start trading again? 
Wednesday of that week. It was funny because I st arted out trading only one  or two S&P contracts 
at a time. The S&P was trading in full point increments [equivalent to $500 per contract, compared 
to $25 for a minimum tick], and I didn't know how  to handicap what was going on. From past

Chunk 3675 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
experiences, I knew we were in some sort of op portunity period, but they were rewriting the rale 
book. My attitude is: Never risk your family's securi ty. I didn't need to make any more money at 
that point. On Wednesday, the market got up to an area where I thought it should be shorted. I  131ended Wednesday short twelve S&P contract s, which for me was a miniscule position. 
That night, Bob Prechter [editor of the Elliott Wave Theorist, a widely followed advisory letter] put

Chunk 3676 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
out a negative hotline message. The next morn ing, the market was under tremendous pressure, 
partially because of that recommendation, but main ly because one of the biggest fund managers in 
the country was trying to liquidate  a monster long position. It has been stated that he lost $800 
million during that period. 
I called the S&P pit just before the opening th at morning, and my clerk said, "Decembers are

quarter of a million dollars on twelve contracts! It  was one of the most memorable trades of my 
life. 
What are your thoughts about program trading? [See Appendix 1 for definition.]  
I hate it. There used to be a natural ebb and flow in the market, but program trading killed it. Those 
firms doing program trading wield extraordinary pow er to move the market , and the locals have

Chunk 3678 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
simply become accomplices. I'm not just paranoid, b ecause I've adjusted to it and been successful. 
But I hate it. 
Some people say that all this criticism of program trading is a bunch of nonsense. 
Well, they are idiots. 
No, some of them are v ery intelligent people. 
No, they are idiots. I can prove to an y one of them that they are idiots. 
How do you prove it? 
There is something I would like the regulators to investigate. The market closes near the high or

Chunk 3679 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
low of the day much more frequently than it used  to. During the last two years, the market has 
closed within 2 percent of the hi gh or low of the day a bout 20 percent of the time. Mathematically, 
that type of distributi on is impossible by chance. 
You talk about program trading as if it is i mmoral. What is unethical about trading stocks 
against futures? 
Because the program traders also have the other si de of the equation to d o. You have the so-called

Chunk 3680 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Chinese wall in investment banki ng, where they don't want the arbi trageurs and investment bankers 
on the same floor for fear they might talk to each other. Well, I would like the SEC to explain to me 
how they can allow agency program traders sitti ng alongside principal traders for the firm's own 
account. 
Your example introduces an element of frontrunning, which obscures the basic question. 
What I am trying to get at is : What is immoral ab out buying stock and se lling futures (or the

Chunk 3681 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):

Because I've seen situations in which a firm ha s information about a debt/equity swap a day ahead 
of time. For example, when the st ate of New Jersey sold  $2 billion worth of st ock and moved it into 
the bonds, this firm knew about it the day before. Si nce they knew they were  going to be selling $2 
billion worth of stock the next day, from 4:00 to 4:15, they sold thousands of futures contracts to

Chunk 3682 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
set up the trade. That stinks. 
The example you just gave is (a) a case of tr ading on inside information, (b) frontrunning, 
and (c) an outright trade. It is  not a program trade. Let me gi ve you an example. Let's say a 
trading firm has a computer program that si gnals when stocks are overpriced or un-
derpriced relative to futures, and they  are not doing any customer business— 
Let me give you an example first. If these broker age firms need an 80-cent discount to take off a

Chunk 3683 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
customer program, they will take off their own position at a 50-cent discount. They have the edge 
and can ran in front of their clients because thei r transaction costs are lower—they're not paying 
commissions to themselves. 
I keep trying to separate these things out.  Let's take an example where there is no 
frontrunning or customer business—just somebody  trading their own money, trying to take

Chunk 3684 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
out an arbitrage profit. If that is their methodology, why is it any worse than your  132methodology? 
Because it is a dumb game. Anybody who puts on a ba sket of stocks to earn 80 basis points above 
the T-bill yield is an idiot! They are the same idio ts I tried to get away from when I left security 
analysis. Who the hell needs to earn 80 basis points over Treasur y bills? The brokerage firms sell

Chunk 3685 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
them this bill of goods because it is a way of cr eating more order flow, which on Wall Street today 
has become the ultimate power. 
Are you saying program trading is wrong, even fo r some entity that is not trading customer 
money? 
I grew up being a security analyst, analyzing thin gs and buying something for value. Trading stocks 
against stock index futures, in a nd out, serves no useful purpose. 
They are buying and selling, and you are buy ing and selling. What's the difference?

Chunk 3686 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I am trying to earn infinity when I trade. 
What makes that style any more ri ght than the style which is tr ying to arbitrage the market? 
I guess it is their constitutional righ t and they are able to do it, but there are some incredible abuses 
as a consequence. I scream at the kids who work  for these brokerage firms: "You SOBs have no 
integrity, no ethics! You know what will happen? You are going to kill th e game." Now they are

Chunk 3687 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
swearing at me. When they stopped doing proprieta ry program trading they said, "Are you happy? 
You got your wish!" I said, "No, it is not quite fini shed yet." I didn't tell them the conclusion, which 
comes when they are no longer earning $300,000 or mo re a year, and they find out what they are 
really worth; when they are hitting the bricks  and can't get a job for $50,000. Then it will have 
come full circle.

Chunk 3688 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
come full circle. 
Speaking of circles, we seem to be moving in on e on this subject. Let's go on. What stands out 
as your most dramatic trading experience? 
The most gut-wrenching time was in November 1982. I had a much smaller net worth then, and I 
took a $600,000 loss in one day. 
What happened? 
It was Election Day, and the Republicans did much be tter than expected in the congressional races.

Chunk 3689 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The market ran up 43 points, which at that time was one of the largest point advances in history. I 
was short, and like an imbecile, I sold more with the S&P locked at the 500-point limit against me 
and less than an hour left in the trading session. 
My wife, who was working with me at the time, was out that day. The next day she came into 
work, and every ten minutes she would say, "Get smaller, get smaller." I kept taking losses, just 
getting out of the position.

Chunk 3690 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
getting out of the position. 
Whenever you get hit, you are very upset emo tionally. Most traders try to make it back 
immediately; they try to play bi gger. Whenever you try to get all your losses back at once, you are 
most often doomed to fail. That is true in everything—investments, trading, gambling. I learned 
from the crap table at Las Vegas to keep only X do llars in my pocket and never to have any credit,

Chunk 3691 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
because the worst thing you can do is to send good money after bad. If you can physically remove 
yourself from the premises, which is the same thing in futures trading as getting flat, you can see 
things in a whole different perspective. 
After a devastating loss, I always play very sma ll and try to get black i nk, black ink. It's not how 
much money I make, but just get ting my rhythm and confidence bac k. I shrink my size totally—to

Chunk 3692 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
a fifth or a tenth of the position that I trade norm ally. And it works. I think I ended up losing only 
$57,000 in November 1982, after taking a $600,000 hit on November 4. 
Is there any trading mistake that you could isol ate as responsible for that Election Day, 1982, 
loss? 
Adding to shorts when the futures market is al ready locked-limit against you and the cash market 
looks like it is 200 points higher is pretty stupid. 
When you look back, do you say, "Why did I do it?"

Chunk 3693 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I think because I had huge gains the month before. I've always ha d my biggest setbacks after my 
biggest victories. I was careless.  133Do you still make trading mistakes? By that, I mean deviations from trading principles you 
consider valid—not losing trades. 
You always make trading mistakes. I made one just  recently—a terrible mistake. I was short the 
S&P and short the bonds, and I got nervous be - cause the bonds moved above their moving

Chunk 3694 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
average. However, T-bills had not followed suit. One of my rules is  not to have a position when my 
moving averages in T-bills and bonds diverge—that is, when one moving average is above the 
price and the other below—because interest rate s can't move very far until one confirms the 
movement of the other. According to my rales,  I should have moved my bond position from short 
to flat; instead, I reversed from short to long. I pa id dearly for that mistake. Whereas, I had lost

Chunk 3695 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
only about $20,000 on my original short position, th e next day I had a six-figure loss—my largest 
loss of the year. 
The great thing about being a trad er is that you can always do a much better job. No matter how 
successful you are, you know how many times you sc rew up. Most people, in most careers, are 
busy trying to cover up their mistakes. As a tr ader, you are forced to confront your mistakes 
because the numbers don't lie.

Chunk 3696 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
because the numbers don't lie. 
From time to time, you have alluded to  your trading rules. Can you list them? 
[Reading from a list and extemporizing] I always ch eck my charts and the moving averages prior to 
taking a position. Is the price above or below the m oving average? That works better than any tool I 
have. I try not to go against the movi ng averages; it is self-destructive. 
Has a stock held above its most recent low, when the market has penetrated its most recent low? If

Chunk 3697 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
so, that stock is much healthier than the market. Those are the types of di vergences I always look 
for. 
Before putting on a position always ask, "Do I really want to have this position?" 
After a successful period, take a day off as a reward. I've found it difficult to sustain excellent 
trading for more than two weeks at a time. I've had periods where I can be profitable for twelve 
days in a row, but eventually you just get battle fatigue. So, after a strong run of pr ofits, I try to

Chunk 3698 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
play smaller rather than larger. My biggest lo sses have always followed my largest profits. 
This next rale is a major problem for me; I'm always trying not to break it. The rale: Bottom fishing 
is one of the most expensive forms of gambling. It 's OK to break this rale on occasion if you have 
sufficient justification. For example, today, I bou ght the S&Ps when they were down sharply. Two 
weeks ago, I had written down the number 248.45 as the best entry for the S&P. The low today was

Chunk 3699 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
248.50. Consequently, I was able to buy into weakne ss today and make a good deal of money. I had 
a plan, I carried it out, and it work ed. It doesn't always work. It was risky, but I wasn't pyramiding 
wildly into it, and I kne w how much I was risking. 
That brings me to my next rule: Before ta king a position, always know the amount you are willing 
to lose. Know your "uncle point" and honor it. I have a pain threshold, and if I reach that point, I 
must get out.

Chunk 3700 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
must get out. 
When T-bonds and T-bills differ in respect to thei r individual relationship between price and the 
moving average—one above the moving average, the other below—have no position until one 
confirms the direction of the other. [Generally speaking, a price above its moving average implies a 
price uptrend, while th e reverse case implies a price downtrend.] 
Then, the last words I have at the bottom of  the page are: Work, work, and more work.

Chunk 3701 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Is there anything to add to that list? 
The most important thing is money manage ment, money management, money management. 
Anybody who is successful will tell you the same thing. 
The one area that I am constantly trying to improve on is to let my gains ran. I'm not able to do that 
well. I'm always working on it. To my dyi ng day, I'll probably still be working on it. 
Is that because you do something wrong?

Chunk 3702 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Is that because you do something wrong? 
I just love to take profits. I hear music when  the cash register rings. The irony is: How can I be 
willing to risk 400 points on the downside and onl y take 200 points of a 1,000-point move on the 
upside? 
On the risk side, you have a method, a plan. Have you experi mented with trying to use  134similar discipline on the profit side? 
Yes, but I haven't been able to perfect it. I have ha d varying degrees of success,  but it is my greatest

Chunk 3703 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
criticism of myself. 
Why the difficulty in this area? 
I think it all relates to my fears of some cataclys mic event. I'm like W. C. Fields: I have several 
bank accounts and a few safe deposit boxes with gol d and cash. I'm extremel y well diversified. My 
thought process is that if I screw up in one place, I'll always have a life preserver someplace else. 
Any other rules you can think of? 
Yes. If you're ever very ner vous about a position overnight, a nd especially over a weekend, and

Chunk 3704 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
you're able to get out at a much better price than you thought possible when the market trades, 
you're usually better off staying with the positio n. For example, the other day I was short the S&P 
and got nervous because the bond market was very  strong on the night session. The next morning, 
the stock market was virtually unchanged. I was so relieved that I could get out without a loss, I 
covered my position. That was a mistake. A little  later that day, the S&P collapsed. When your

worst fears aren't realized, you pr obably should increase your position. 
What has been your worst drawdown percentage wise? 
My records were just evaluated for a money management deal. Over  my entire career  as a full-time 
trader, based on month-end data, my biggest draw down was 3 percent. I ha d my worst two months 
around the birth of my two children, because I wa s worried about whether I was going to get the 
tennis ball in the right place in Lamaze class.

Chunk 3706 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
tennis ball in the right place in Lamaze class. 
My philosophy has always been to  try to be profitable every single month. I even try to be 
profitable every single day. And I've had some extraordinary runs—over 90 percent of my months 
have been profitable. I'm particul arly proud of the fact that, in vi rtually every year, I didn't have a 
losing month before April. I probably don't make as much money as I could because of that, but I'm 
more concerned about controlling the downside.

Chunk 3707 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
more concerned about controlling the downside. 
You start off every year with a clean slate? 
That's my philosophy: January 1, I'm poor. 
Do you trade smaller in January? 
Not necessarily. It is just that my attention is greater. 
Do you take your losses more quickly in January? 
No, I always take my losses quickly. That is prob ably the key to my success. You can always put 
the trade back on, but if you go fl at, you see things differently. 
Greater clarity?

Chunk 3708 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Greater clarity? 
Much greater clarity because the pressure you feel when you are in a position that is not working 
puts you in a catatonic state. 
Getting back to managed money, I wonder, after years of making plenty of money trading on 
your own, what possible motive could you have for bothering with managing other people's 
money? 
I felt that I was getting a little stale, and this presents a whole new challenge. Also, after October

Chunk 3709 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
1987,1 realized that downside risk can't be adequa tely measured. The way to get more personal 
leverage is with an outside pool of money. 
How much money are you going to be managing? 
I don't want to be specific about the amount, bu t I'm only taking on one or two large pools of 
money. I don't want to deal with multiple invest ors, even though I'm certain I could raise a great 
deal more money if I went  with a public underwriting.

Chunk 3710 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The more people you have involved, the more potential headaches. For example, when I met a 
large fund manager, he asked me how many employees  I had. I told him, "None." He told me he 
had seventy. When he wants to qui t, it will be more difficult because  he'll have their lives in his 
hands. I don't want that kind of pressure. 
You seem rather isolated here. Do you like working alone?  135It took me several years to be able to accept wo rking alone. I used to go to a downtown office

there, the attraction diminished significantly. Now, I have half a dozen peopl e I talk to on the phone 
daily. I've taught my methodologies to a number of them, and they have methodologies of their 
own. 
Have you ever tried training people to be traders working for you? 
I hired four people, but nobody lasted. They all becam e intimidated. I tried to  clone myself and it

You can't teach them your stomach. 
Why do most traders lose money? 
Because they would rather lose money than  admit they're wrong. What is the ultimate 
rationalization of a trader in a losing position? "I'll get out when I'm even." Why is getting out even 
so important? Because it protects the ego. I became  a winning trader when I was able to say, "To

What do you tell people who seek your advice? 
I always try to encourage people that are thinking of going into this business for themselves. I tell 
them, "Think that you might become more successf ul than you ever dreamt, because that's what 
happened to me." I have the freedom  I always wanted, both financially  and structurally. I can go on

What is the best advice you can give to the or dinary guy trying to become a better trader? 
Learn to take losses. The most im portant thing in making money is not letting your losses get out of 
hand. Also, don't increase your position size until you have doubled or tripled your capital. Most 
people make the mistake of increasing their bets as soon as they start making money. That is a 
quick way to get wiped out.

money to keep himself near broke, despite cons istently earning good salari es. Yet, Schwartz was 
eventually able to turn things around and become one of the world's best traders. 
How did he do it? There were two essential elem ents. First, he found a methodology that worked

Chunk 3716 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
for him. Throughout his losing years, Schwartz used  fundamental analysis to  determine his trades. 
It was not until he immersed himself in technical analysis that he became successful. The point here 
is not that technical analysis is better than fundamental analysis, but  rather that technical analysis 
was the methodology that was right for him. Some of the other traders in terviewed in this book, 
such as James Rogers, have been  very successful using fundament al analysis to the complete

Chunk 3717 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
exclusion of technical analysis. The key lesson is that each trader must find his or her own best 
approach. 
The second element behind Schwartz's transition to success was a change in attitude. As he 
describes it, he became successful  when his desire to win took precedence over his desire to be 
right. 
Risk control is an essential element of Schwartz's trading style, as attested to by his incredibly low

Chunk 3718 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
drawdowns. He achieves this risk control by alwa ys knowing his "uncle poi nt" on any trade. No 
doubt, his approach of sharply reducing position size after large losses, as well as extended winning 
streaks, contributes heavily to his success. The rationale for reducing position size after a 
destabilizing lo ss is apparent. 
However, the reason for taking the same action afte r a winning streak deserves further elaboration.

Chunk 3719 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
As Schwartz explains it, he ha s always experienced his biggest losses after his biggest gains. I 
suspect this is true for the majority of tr aders. Winning streaks lead to complacency, and 
complacency leads to sloppy trading. 
Most traders cite similar rules (s uch as discipline and hard work) as the reasons for their success. 
Therefore, it is always a treat when a top trader provides a rule that is uni que and rings true. I was

Chunk 3720 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
fascinated with Schwartz's observation about ma intaining a position that you are worried about,  136when the market action doesn't justify your fears. The implicit concept is that if the market is 
letting you off the hook eas ily on a position for wh ich there was a basis for fear (such as a 
fundamental development adverse to the position or  a technical breakout in the opposite direction), 
there must be strong underlying forces in favor  of the direction of the original position.

  139James B. Rogers, Jr.-Buying Value and Selling Hysteria 
Jim Rogers began trading the stock market with  a paltry $600 in 1968. In 1973, he formed the

Chunk 3722 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Quantum Fund with partner George Soros. The Quantum Fund proved to be one of the best-
performing hedge funds, and in 1980, having amassed a small fortune, Rogers retired. "Retired" is 
the word Rogers uses to describe the manageme nt of his personal portfolio, an endeavor that 
requires considerable ongoing research. His retireme nt also includes teaching investment courses at 
the Columbia University Graduate School of Business.

Chunk 3723 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I was eager to interview Rogers because of his st ellar reputation as  one of the shrewdest investors 
of our time and because his comments on televi sion financial interview shows and in the print 
media always seemed to strike a note of comm on sense with rare clarit y. Since I did not know 
Rogers, I sent him a letter requesting an inte rview, explaining that I was working on a book on 
great traders. I included a copy of  my previous book on the futures markets, which I inscribed with

Chunk 3724 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
a quotation from Voltaire that I deemed partic ularly appropriate: "Common sense is not so 
common." 
Rogers called a few days later to thank me for the book and to indicate his willingness to 
participate. "However," he cautione d, "I am probably not the person you want to interview. I often 
hold positions for many years. Furthermore, I'm pr obably one of the world's worst traders. I never

Chunk 3725 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
get in at the right time." He was referring to the distinct ion I had made in my le tter, indicating that I 
was interested in great traders rather than great investors. 
As I use the term, a "trader" would be primarily concerned with which dire ction the stock market 
was heading, while an "investor" would concentrat e on selecting stocks w ith the best chance of 
outperforming the market overall. In other words, the investor was always long, while the trader

Chunk 3726 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
might be long or short. I explaine d my use of these terms to Rogers  and stressed that he was indeed 
the type of person I wished to interview. 
I arrived at Rogers' home, a ba ronial, eclectically furnished townhouse, on a fall-like spring 
afternoon. The atmosphere seemed more reminiscen t of a comfortable English manor than a home 
in New York City. In fact, if my only exposure to  New York City was that afternoon's conversation

Chunk 3727 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
with Rogers in his antique-fill ed sitting room, with its pleasa nt views of the Hudson, I would 
conclude that New York City was an eminently peaceful place to live. Af ter greeting me, Rogers 
immediately stated, "I still thin k you have the wrong man." Once again,  he was referring to the fact 
that he did not consider himself to be a trader . This is the note on which the following interview 
begins.

Chunk 3728 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
begins. 
As I told you in our phone conversation, I don't consider myself a trader. I remember when I went 
to buy German stocks in 1982,1 said to the broker, "I want you to buy me X, Y, and Z stocks." The 
broker, who didn't know me, asked, "What do I do ne xt?" I said, "You buy the stocks and send me 
the confirmations." He asked, "Do you want me to  send you some research?" I said, "Please don't

Chunk 3729 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
do that." He asked, "Do you want  me to send you opinions?" I sa id, "No, no, don't." He asked, "Do 
you want me to call you with prices?" I said, "N o, don't even give me prices, because if you do, 
once I see that these stocks have doubled and tripled, I might be temp ted to sell them. I plan to own 
German stocks for at least three years, because I think you are about to have the biggest bull market

Chunk 3730 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
you've had in two or three generations." Needless  to say, the broker was dumbfounded; he thought I 
was a madman. 
Now I don't consider that trading; it was determining that there was a bout to be a major change in a 
market and taking a position. By the way, I got that  one right. I bought the German stocks at the 
end of 1982 and sold them out in late 1985 and early 1986. 
What made you so bullish on Germany at that time?

Chunk 3731 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The bull market had started here in August 1982. More important, Germany had not had any kind 
of bull market since the previous all-time high  in 1961, twenty-one years earlier. The German 
market had crumbled in 1962 and had essentially gone sideways since then. In the meantime, the 
German economy had boomed. So there was basic value there. 
Whenever I buy or sell something, I always try to make sure I'm not  going to lose any money first.

Chunk 3732 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
If there is very good value, th en I'm probably not going to lose  much money even if I'm wrong.  140But you could have bought that market ten years earlier on the same theory. 
That's absolutely right. You could have bought it in 1971 for exactly thos e reasons and watched 
German stocks sit for ten years, while we had a major bull market in the U.S. But this time there 
was a catalyst. You always need a catalyst to make  big things happen. At the time, the catalyst was

Chunk 3733 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the upcoming German elections. I figured the Soci alists were going to be thrown out, and I knew 
that the opposition party, the Christian Democrats, had a platform designed to encourage 
investment. 
My basic assessment was that if the conservative Christian Democrats won the election after having 
been out of power for so many years, they were  going to make major changes. I also knew that 
many German companies were holding back from i nvesting in capital equi pment and expansion in

Chunk 3734 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
1982 in anticipation of a conservative  victory. Therefore, if the c onservatives did win, there would 
be a real explosion of pent-up capital investment. 
Was the election a toss-up at the time? 
Not in my mind. 
I mean in terms of the polls. 
I guess so, because when the conservatives did win, the market exploded flmt same day. 
What if they had lost? 
I still didn't think I would have lost any meaningful money for th e reasons I mentioned before. I

Chunk 3735 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
had every anticipation that there was going to be a major change, and that the bull market would 
last for two, three, or four years. 
It sounds like you have a great deal of  conviction when you put on a trade. 
Yes, I usually do; otherwise, I don't bother doing it. One of the best ra les anybody can learn about 
investing is to do nothing, abso lutely nothing, unless there is something to do. Most people—not

Chunk 3736 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that I'm better than most people—always have to  be playing; they al ways have to be doing 
something. They make a big play and say, "Boy, am I smart, I just tripled my money." Then they 
rash out and have to do somethi ng else with that money. They can 't just sit there and wait for 
something new to develop. 
Do you always wait for a situation to line up in  your favor? Don't you ever say, "I think this 
market is probably going to go up, so I'll give it a shot"?

Chunk 3737 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
What you just described is a very fast way to the poorhouse. I just wa it until there is money lying in 
the corner, and all I have to do is go over there and pick it up. I do nothing in the meantime. Even 
people who lose money in the market say, "I just lost my money, now I have to do something to 
make it back." No, you don't. You shoul d sit there until you find something. 
Trade as little as possible.

Chunk 3738 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Trade as little as possible. 
That is why I don't think of myself as a trad er. I think of myself as  someone who waits for 
something to come along. I wait for a situation that is like the proverbial "shoo ting fish in a barrel." 
Are all your trades fundamentally oriented? 
Yes. Occasionally, however, the Commodity Research Bureau charts will provide a catalyst. 
Sometimes the chart for a market will show an incredible spike either up or down. You will see

Chunk 3739 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
hysteria in the charts. When I see hy steria, I usually like to take a l ook to see if I shouldn't be going 
the other way. 
Can you think of any examples? 
Yes. Two years ago, I went short soybeans after they had gone st raight up to $9.60. The reason I 
remember it so vividly is because that same even ing, I went to dinner with a group of traders, one 
of whom was talking about  all the reasons why he had bought s oybeans. I said, "I really can't tell

Chunk 3740 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
you why all the bullish arguments are wrong; al l I know is that I'm shorting hysteria." 
How do you pick the time to go against the hysteria? 
I wait until the market starts moving in gaps. 
In the midst of it all, or do you wait for so me sign of an end to the move, for example, a 
reversal day?  141No, I don't know about reversal days. 
That brings to mind a classic example of hysteria. In late 1979-early 1980, the gold market

Chunk 3741 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
witnessed an incredible accelerated ad vance. Did you go short that market? 
Yes, I sold gold at $675. 
That was almost $200 too early! 
I told you I'm not a good trader. I'm nearly always too early, but it was only about four days before 
the top. 
I didn't say you were way off timewise, but pricewis e it must have been a pretty scary ride. 
When you do a trade like that, isn't th ere a point where you have second thoughts? 
Yes, when it goes to $676 [he laughs].

Chunk 3742 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yes, when it goes to $676 [he laughs].  
But you stayed with the trade? 
Yes, in that case, because it was chaos. It was something that couldn't last. It was the gold market's 
dying gasp. 
Was that a matter of recognizing the fingerprint of  a market in its final blowoff, or was it a 
matter of gold being overpriced? 
Both. Gold was overpriced, but basically it was— I like your terminology—the "fingerprint" of

Chunk 3743 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
hysteria. Just about every time you go against pa nic, you will be right if you can stick it out. 
So when you see panic, do you automatically go against it? 
The panic, the hysteria, in and of itself is only a cat alyst to make me look to see what is going on. It 
doesn't mean I'm going to do anything. In the case of the early 1980 gold market, I had a view of 
the world that was bearish for gol d. Volcker had just become the Federal Reserve Chairman a few

Chunk 3744 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
months earlier and said that we were going to beat inflation. I believed he meant it. I also happened 
to be bearish on oil at the time, and I knew that  if oil went down, gold would go down as well. 
Was that because you thought gol d and oil should move together,  or because you thought the 
rest of the world believed that? 
At that time, everybody in the world believed that.  
But, did you believe that the relationship was true? 
I knew that it was not true.

Chunk 3745 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I knew that it was not true. 
The reason I asked is that I have always felt that the relationship between gold and oil was a 
coincidental correlation. 
Yes, that was all it was. For one very short period of time, gold a nd oil moved together. 
Does that mean you will sometimes do a trade based on a relationship you know doesn't 
really make any sense, simply  because you think that the rest of the world believes it?

Chunk 3746 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Rarely. I usually like to look at what I think is the fact, th e truth. The main item then was that I 
thought Volcker meant it when he said he was going to break the back of inflation. The fact that oil 
was ready to go down anyway was just the kicker. 
Actually, the decisive step came in Octo ber 1979, when the Fed changed its policy from 
controlling interest rates to controlling money supply growth. Yet the gold market apparently

Chunk 3747 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
didn't believe it, because it went up for several mont hs after that point. In situations like that, 
are the markets too wound up in their hysteria to pay attention to changing fundamentals? 
Absolutely. It is ama/ing how sometimes someth ing important will happen, and the market will 
keep going despite that. Now, I am experienced enough to know that  just because I see something 
doesn't mean that everyone sees it. A lot of peop le are going to keep buying or selling just because

Chunk 3748 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that has been the thing to do. 
So, just because the market doesn't respond to  some important news, such as the October 
1979 change in Fed policy, doesn't mean that it isn't important. 
All the better. If the market keeps going the way it shouldn't go, especially if it is a hysterical 
blowoff, then you know an opportunity will present itself.  142Can you think of a more recent example? 
Yes, October 1987. October 19 is my birthday, by the way. At the end of 1986 and the beginning of

Chunk 3749 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
1987,1 had predicted that we would have one more  big move up in the stock market and then 
witness the worst bear market since 1937. But I di dn't know it was going to happen on my birthday. 
It was the best birthday present I ever had. 
Did you have any idea that the break could be as large as it was? 
When John Train interviewed me in January 1987,1 told him, "Somewhe re along the way, the 
market is going to go down 300 points in one day."  He looked at me as though I were a madman. I

Chunk 3750 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
envisioned that the Dow would be around 3,000, and 300 points would only be 10 percent. In 1929, 
the market went down 12 percent in one day. Ten percent in one day was not such a big move, 
given the kind of markets we were having then. The market had already seen a number of 3,4, and 
5 percent days. So I said, "Why can't the market go down 300 points in a day?" Little did I know it 
would be 508 points. 
Why did you pick 1937 as a comparison in you r prediction for a st ock market collapse?

Chunk 3751 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Because in 1937, the Dow went down 49 percent in si x months. What I was trying to say was that 
we were going to have a major, fast, deep, horrible collapse, as opposed to say 1973-1974, when 
the market went down 50 per cent, but it took two years. 
Why did you use 1937 as an analogy as opposed to 1929-1930? 
Because 1929-1930 went on to be a major depression. I knew we were going to have a bear market

Chunk 3752 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
caused by a major financial collapse. I was not c onvinced we were going to  have a depression. I 
was differentiating between a financial and economic collapse. 
Why were you expecting a financial collapse? 
It was the atmosphere. Money wa s flooding the world. Every stock ma rket in the world was at an 
all-time high. You had all these stories of young guys, three years out of school, making half a

Chunk 3753 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
million dollars a year. That is not reality. Whenever  you see that in a market, you are near a top. So, 
I went into the summer positioned for a collapse. 
Were you short stocks or long puts? 
I was short stocks and short calls. I don't buy options. Buying options is another fast way to the 
poorhouse. Someone did a study for the SEC and discove red that 90 percent of all options expire as 
losses. Well, I figured out that if 90 percent of all long option positions lose money, that meant that

Chunk 3754 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
90 percent of all short option positio ns make money. If I want to us e options to be bearish, I sell 
calls. 
When did you cover your positions? 
During the week of October 19. If you remember, by that time, everybody thought that the financial 
structure of America was over. 
Did you cover then because we had hysteria going the other way? 
That is exactly right. That week  was a textbook case of hysteria. U nder those kind of  conditions, if

Chunk 3755 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
you are still solvent, you have to step in there an d go against it. Maybe that was going to be the one 
time it was the end of the world, and I would have been wiped out too. But 95 percent of the time 
when you go against that kind of hysteria, you are going to make money. 
Between October 1987 and January 1988,1 didn't have a ny shorts. That was one of the few times in 
my whole life that I didn't have any shorts. Whet her I am bullish or bearish, I always try to have

Chunk 3756 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
both long and short positions—just in case I'm wrong. Ev en in the best of times, there is always 
somebody fouling up, and even in the worst of times, there is somebody doing well. 
Are you implying that after the collapse, you coul dn't find any stocks you wanted to be short? 
I thought that if I were right a nd the world wasn't coming to an  end right away, everything was 
going to go up—including those stocks that I knew,  fundamentally, were coming apart at the

Chunk 3757 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
seams. In January [ 1988], I started putting a couple of shorts back on, and even though I am losing 
money on one of those shorts, I am happy to do it because I feel more comfortable having the 
protection of some short positions.  143A lot of people blame the October 1987 break on program trading. Do you consider that 
scapegoatism? 
Absolutely. The people who blame it on that do not  understand the market. Politicians and people

Chunk 3758 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
who lose money always look for scapegoats. In 1929, they blamed the cras h on short sellers and 
margin requirements. There were lots of good r easons why the stock market went down. What they 
should focus on is why there were sellers on October 19, but no buyers. 
I remember why I became even more bearish on the weekend before October 19. The week before, 
[Federal Reserve Chairman] Alan Greenspan announ ced that the balance of trade was getting much

Chunk 3759 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
better and things were under control. Two days la ter, the balance of trade figures came out, and 
they were the worst in the history of the world. Right away I said, "This guy is either a fool or a 
liar. He doesn't have any idea what is going on." Then on the w eekend before October 19, you had 
[Treasury Secretary] Baker telling the world we we re going to stick it to the Germans by letting the 
dollar go, because the Germans weren't looseni ng monetary and fiscal policy as Baker had

Chunk 3760 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
demanded. It looked like the trade wa rs of the 1930s all over again. 
I was in a panic—and I was already short! I called Singapore that Sunday night to add to my shorts. 
[Singapore opens earlier than we do.] So all thos e guys who came in on Monday to sell had very, 
very good reasons to sell, and there were no buye rs around. There were no buyers, because there 
was no reason for people to buy. Even the buyers  were scared and bearish that Monday.

Chunk 3761 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Are you saying the crash was caused by Greenspan and Baker? 
There were a lot of causes: Greenspan, Baker, th e fact that money was ti ght, the steady worsening 
of the balance of trade,  and you had a market that had spiked  up to 2,700 six weeks earlier. If you 
check, you will see that, during 1987, while the S& P and the Dow were going up, the rest of the 
market was quietly eroding awa y. In December 1986,1 shorted the financial stocks, and throughout

Chunk 3762 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
1987,1 didn't lose any money, even though the Dow and the S&P were going through the roof. 
Were there any times you faded hysteria and lost? 
Yes, one of my greatest lessons happened in my early days and taught me about bear markets. In 
January 1970, a time when I still bought options, I took all the m oney I had—which wasn't very 
much—and bought puts. In May 1970, the market caved  in, and the day the market hit bottom, I

Chunk 3763 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
sold my puts. I had tripled my money. I was a geni us! "I'm going to be the next Bernard Baruch," I 
said to myself. 
My plan then was to wait for the market to rally and this time to sell short instead of buying puts so 
that I would make money faster. Sure enough the market rallied, and I took everything I had and 
went short. Needless to say, two months later, I was completely wiped out because I didn't know 
what I was doing.

Chunk 3764 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
what I was doing. 
One of the stocks I had shorted was Memorex. I sold Memorex at 48. In those days, I didn't have 
the staying power—psychologically, emotionally, and, most important , financially. I ended up 
covering my shorts at 72. Memorex eventually went  to about 96 and then went straight down to 2. 
I was dead right, absolutely, flat-out, perfectly right  to short that stock at 48.1 just ended up getting

Chunk 3765 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
completely wiped out. The market di dn't care that I was dead right. That is one of the reasons that I 
now know about hysteria. 
What did you learn from that particular experience? 
That the market is going to go higher than I th ink it can and lower than I think it will. I had a 
tendency to think that if I knew something, ever ybody knew it. I would just read things in the 
paper; I didn't have any inside information. What  I now know is that they don't know what I know.

Chunk 3766 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Most people don't have the foresi ght to look six months , one year, or two years out. The Memorex 
experience taught me that anything can happen in the stock market, because there are a lot of 
people in the market who don' t understand what is going on. 
Are you looking for a very pronounced bear market beyond what we have already seen? 
Yes, eventually I expect the market  to break the October 1987 low.  
Do you expect a very deep recession as well?

Chunk 3767 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Do you expect a very deep recession as well? 
Right now [April 1988], I'm still looking mainly for a financial collapse. However, the politicians 
may foul it up and turn it into an economic collapse.  144Can we get a financial collapse without actually having a very serious recession? 
Sure. It has happened lots of times. That is w hy I used 1937 as an example before. I don't expect 
the economy to collapse because as the dollar k eeps getting weaker—which is what I expect—

Chunk 3768 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
many parts of the American economy will do well—steel, agriculture, textiles, mining. 
So even if the stock market falls below the Oc tober low, you can still see the economy doing 
well? 
Absolutely. Unless the politicians foul it up.  
By doing what? 
Raising taxes, tariffs, protectionism. There are lots of thi ngs the politicians can do to foul it up, and 
I'm sure they will—they always have. I know we w ill have a financial crisis . And, if the politicians

Chunk 3769 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
get it wrong, we may get an economic collapse as well. 
What is going to trigge r the financial collapse? 
The trade figures will start getting worse again, a nd this will eventually precipitate another dollar 
crisis. 
What do you see as the main cause of the trade deficit? 
The budget deficit, by and large, causes the trade de ficit. You are not going to get rid of the trade 
deficit until you get rid of the budget deficit.

Chunk 3770 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
deficit until you get rid of the budget deficit. 
Given the magnitude of the defici t problem, is there anything that can be done at this point? 
The basic problem in the world to day is that America is consumi ng more than it is saving. You 
need to do everything you can to encourage saving and investment: Eliminate taxation of savings, 
the capital gains tax, and dual taxa tion of dividends; bring back the more attractive incentives for

Chunk 3771 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
IRAs, Keoghs, and 401Ks. At the same time, you need to do everything you can to discourage 
consumption. Change our tax structure to utilize a value added tax, which taxes consumption rather 
than saving and investing. Cut gove rnment spending dramatically—and  there are lots of ways of 
doing it without hurting the econom y too badly. We would have pr oblems, but the problems would 
not be nearly as bad as when they are forced on us. If we don't bite the bullet, then we are going to

Chunk 3772 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
have a 1930s-type collapse. 
Your answer implies that there are relatively painless ways to cut government spending 
"dramatically." Could you provi de some specific examples? 
I'll give you two examples; I could give you a dozen. The U.S. government spends $5 billion a year 
to support the domestic price of sugar so that Americans can pay 22 cents a pound wholesale, when 
it is selling for 8 cents a pound in th e world market. Five billion dolla rs! We would be better off if

Chunk 3773 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the government told every sugar grower, "We'll gi ve you $100,000 a year for the rest of your life, a 
condominium, and a Porsche if you just get out of the s ugar business." We woul d save billions of 
dollars a year, and the whole count ry would be better off because we would all be paying less for 
sugar. 
If you really want to save a big number, do you know  what our annual balance of trade deficit is?

Chunk 3774 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
One hundred and fifty billion dollars. Do you know wh at it costs us each year to keep American 
troops stationed in Europe? One hundred and fifty billion dollars. American troops were sent there 
as an army of occupation forty- three years ago! Most people in this country weren't even born 
when the decision was made to send our troops to Europe. They ar e doing nothing th ere but sitting 
around, drinking beer, getting fat, and chasing girl s. The GAO has said that we don't have enough

Chunk 3775 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
bullets to fight even a th irty-day war in Europe. Yet it costs us $150 billion a year to keep those 
guys there. I would submit to you that if we stop spending that $150 billion a year and bring those 
troops home, the Europeans would defend themselves. And the kicker is: Do you know who they 
would buy their guns from? They would buy their guns from us, because they don't have a very 
good defense industry establishment.

Chunk 3776 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
good defense industry establishment. 
But those are very unlikely actions. No politic ians are even talking about those solutions. 
I understand that. With the present cast of je rks in Washington, it is not going to happen. The 
politicians are going to foul things up. They are not going to do what ha s to be done. They are

Chunk 3777 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
going to be more concerned about keeping their vot es and winning the next election. That is going  145to continue until we are forced into solving our  problems. Then it is going to be a disaster. 
If the politicians don't act, do we eventually  face a choice between very  high inflation or a 
deep recession? 
It is going to be an extreme. What I suspect wi ll happen—and I am just speculating, I don't have to

Chunk 3778 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
make this decision yet—is that somewhere along the line a recession will develop. Initially, the 
politicians will say, "We've got to  bite the bullet and suffer through this. This is good for us; it will 
help clean out our system." People are going to buy th at for a while. Then it is going to start to hurt. 
Then it is really going to start to hurt. At that point, the politicians are going to give up, and they

Chunk 3779 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
are going to start to inflate their way out of it. Bu t the only way to inflate your  way out at that point 
is to really print money! 
In that scenario, we start off with a recessi on and end up with very high inflation. 
Right, but we could have wild inflation first and then  deflation. Another very real possibility is that 
we will eventually have exchange controls. Fo rtunately, I don't have to make my investment 
decisions for two or three years forward right now.

Chunk 3780 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
What kind of exchange controls? 
By exchange controls I mean limitations on capit al flows. If you want to go to Europe, you can't 
take more than $1,000. You can't ship money out of  the country without the government's approval. 
What happens to the relative values of currencies in a si tuation like that? 
The dollar disappears. What woul d bring on exchange controls is  the dollar getting weaker and

Chunk 3781 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
weaker. The politicians would then  try to bring in Draconian exch ange controls, which would just 
make the situation worse. 
When you say disappear, are you talking about the dollar becoming like the Argentine peso? 
Why not? Why couldn't it happen? Remember the Civ il War expression, "I don't give a damn about 
a greenback dollar." 
You talk about the collapse of the dollar as if it's an inevitability.

Chunk 3782 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
In 1983, we were the largest creditor nation in the world. In 1985, we became a debtor nation for 
the first time since 1914. By the end of 1987, our fore ign debts were greater than all of the foreign 
debts of every nation sout h of the Rio Grande put together: Brazi l, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, and all 
the rest. 
Can I paraphrase the chain of events you imply as follows: Nothing meaningful will be done

Chunk 3783 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to change the budget deficit situation. The co ntinued budget deficit will guarantee that the 
trade deficit situation stays bad or even gets worse. That, in turn, guarantees that sooner or 
later, the dollar will come  under extreme pressure. 
Absolutely. That's why I'm not long the dollar.  
How does the bond market fit into this scenario? 
At some point, foreigners are going to stop putting money into this country because of the

Chunk 3784 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
weakening dollar. That means the American public wi ll have to finance the debt. We have only a 3 
to 4 percent savings rate. To get the American public  to finance that debt, interest rates would have 
to be very high. If the Federal Reserve tries to  avoid high rates by printing more money, then the 
dollar just disappears and the Fed loses contro l completely. That is the case where you get

Chunk 3785 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
hyperinflation and 25 to 30 pe rcent interest rates. Either way, we  are going to have high rates. You 
might start out with lower rates first if the politicians decide to bite the bullet by having a recession. 
But then, they will eventually give up and start printing money. 
But, sooner or later, the bond market collapses. 
Absolutely. Sooner or later, we repeat the English experience of not having a long-term bond

Chunk 3786 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
market. But I don't know when sooner or later is. It could be three year s; it could be ten. 
How far did British bonds fall in the situation you are referring to? 
About 70 percent. 
What kind of things do you look at in deciding  which scenario will happen first: deflation or  146inflation? 
Money supply, government deficits, trade deficits , inflation figures, the financial markets, and 
government policy. I look at all those things for the U.S. and key foreign countries as well. It is one

Chunk 3787 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
big, three-dimensional puzzle. However, if you had a three-dimensional puzzle, you could 
eventually put it together. But this puzzle is no t one in which you can spr ead out the pi eces on a 
great big table and put them all together. The picture is always changing. Every day some pieces 
get taken away and others get thrown in. 
While we are on the topic of scenarios, do you have a long-term outlook for gold?

Chunk 3788 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
In 1934, they set the price of gold at $35 an ounce and gold produ ction declined every year 
between 1935 and 1980. Production kept going down b ecause there was no incentive to look for 
gold. During that whole forty-five -year period, the consumption of gold kept going  up, especially 
during the 1960s and 1970s, when we had the elec tronic revolution. Demand got bigger and bigger, 
while at the same time, the supply was going do wn. You would have had a great bull market in

Chunk 3789 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
gold in the 1970s, no matter what. Even  if inflation was at zero perc ent, you still would have had a 
big bull market in gold during the 1970s, because of supply and demand. 
The situation has changed entirely in the 1980s. Th ere is nothing like taki ng the price of gold from 
$35 to $875 to make people go into the gold busi ness. Gold production has gone up every year 
since 1980. Just based on known projections for mi ne openings and expansions, gold production is

Chunk 3790 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
scheduled to go up every year until at least 1995. At the same time, there have been major 
technological advances in the r ecovery processes for gold. In short, there is much more gold 
available than there used to be, and that tr end will continue at least into the mid-1990s. 
I own some gold as an insurance policy, but I don't think gold is go ing to be the great inflation 
hedge of the 1990s that it was in the 1970s, because supply and demand is so different. I don't

Chunk 3791 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
know what the inflation hedge of the 1990s will be  yet, but fortunately, I don't have to decide 
today. 
The supply/demand picture you are painting for gold is obviously negative. But if you put 
that together with a situation in which, us ing your own words, "the dollar disappears," 
wouldn't such an event swamp the int ernal supply/demand balance of gold? 
Certainly, gold may keep its purch asing power. It may do better, it may do worse, but it's not going 
to be the best market.

Chunk 3792 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to be the best market. 
In other words, gold was yesterday's inflation hedge. 
Generals always fight the last war. Portfolio mana gers always invest in the last bull market. The 
idea that gold has always been the great store of value is absurd. There have been many times in 
history when gold has lost purchasing power—sometimes for decades. 
I should add something else about gold. Remember  that three-dimensional puzzle I was talking

Chunk 3793 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
about, where there are always pieces being remove d and added. Don't forget South Africa in that 
puzzle. Gold is more complicated because of th e South African situati on. I fully expect South 
Africa to eventually blow up, because I think that  the government has painted itself too far into a 
corner. If there were a revolut ion tomorrow and the blacks took over, the South African whites 
would dump all their gold. So the pr ice would actually go down a lot.

Chunk 3794 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
In a situation like that, I woul d think the price of gold would go up sharply, because of the 
panic related to disruptio ns in mine production. 
While the revolution is going on, the price will go up, but after that, it will go down. The move 
down will completely confuse everybody. They will  ask, "Why is the pric e of gold moving down?" 
But you will want to buy after that move down, because the euphoria of the revolution will also 
bring chaos.

Chunk 3795 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
bring chaos. 
We have talked about your long-term views fo r the stock market, bonds, currencies, and gold. 
Any thoughts about oil? 
Yes, when the recession hits—and I guarantee it will some day—the price of oil is going to go way 
down. You can put that in writing;  I don't mind saying that. It ce rtainly is goi ng to go under $12. 
Whether that is $11 or $7 or $3,1 don't know. [The price of oil was approximately $16 at the time

Chunk 3796 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
of this interview.]  147Given the general scenario you are talking ab out—the stock market going down, the dollar 
going down, etc.—is there anything that the average guy can do to protect himself? 
Buy European and Far Eastern curren cies; buy Treasury bills; buy farm land. 
How did you first get interested in trading? 
Investing. I stumbled onto Wall Street. In 1964,1 had just finished college and was going on to

Chunk 3797 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
graduate school. I got a summer job through a guy I met, who happened to work for a Wall Street 
firm. I didn't know anything about Wall Street at  the time. I didn't know the difference between 
stocks and bonds. I didn' t even know that there was a difference between stocks and bonds. All I 
knew about Wall Street was that it was somewher e in New York and something unpleasant had 
happened there in 1929.

Chunk 3798 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
happened there in 1929. 
After that summer, I went to Oxford durin g 1964-1966. Whereas all the Americans I knew at 
Oxford were interested in politics, I was more interested in reading the Financial Times.  
Were you trading while you were at Oxford? 
Very lightly. I was an odd letter. The money I wa s investing in the market was my scholarship 
money at Oxford. I would get my scholarship money at the beginning of the y ear and invest as long 
as I could. 
Not exactly deep pockets.

Chunk 3799 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
as I could. 
Not exactly deep pockets. 
[He laughs] If I had lost much mone y in either of those two years 
So you actually started maki ng money right off the bat? 
Yes, I was making money. That was the bull market  of 1964-1965. By the time I left Oxford in the 
summer of 1966, the bear market had started, but I had already paid off my bills. I was lucky. If I 
had gone to Oxford during 1965-1967,1 proba bly would have gotten wiped out. 
What happened after Oxford?

Chunk 3800 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
What happened after Oxford? 
I was in the army for a couple of years, and si nce I didn't have any money, I couldn't follow the 
market. In 1968, the day I got out of the army, I went  to work on Wall Street. I invested everything 
I could. My first wife used to say, "We need a TV ." I said, "What do we need a TV for? Let's put 
the money in the market, and we could have ten TVs." She said, "We need a sofa." I said, "We

Chunk 3801 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
could have ten sofas if we just put the money in the market for a little while." 
What kind of job did you get on Wall Street? 
Junior analyst. 
Covering what stocks? 
Machine tools and then advertising agencies. 
Were you investing in the stocks you were covering? 
I invested in anything.  
Successfully? 
I came into the market on August 1,1968, right at the top. But I still had some money left, and in

Chunk 3802 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
January 1970,1 figured out it was going to be a bear  market. I don't know how I figured it out. As I 
mentioned earlier, I took all th e money I had and bought puts. By May, I had tripled my money. In 
July, I started shorting stocks, and by September, I was wiped out. Those first two years were great: 
I went from being a genius to a fool. 
So you were back to ground zero in  September 1970. What happened then?

Chunk 3803 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I saved everything I had and put it back into the market. I didn't care about a TV or a sofa. The wife 
got rid of me. I was the entrepre neurial spirit personified. Just li ke those guys who build up great 
retail chains, and plow everything back into their stores, I was pl owing everything back into the 
market. 
Were you trading just stocks at this time? 
Bonds, stocks, currencies, commodities. 
When did you get involved in these different markets?

Chunk 3804 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I traded all of them almost fr om the very beginning. Bonds and stocks from day one. Currencies  148fairly early too. When I was at Ox ford, I kept as much money in dollars as I could, because I knew 
they were going to devalue sterling any day. I kn ew it was coming, and it di d—a year af ter I left. 
Once again, I was a little ear ly. Even then, I had a str ong awareness of currencies. 
In the late 1960s, I also got involved in comm odities by buying gold. In my early years in the

Chunk 3805 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
business, I remember interviewing for a job. The fellow asked me, "What do you read in the Wall 
Street Journal' I said, "One of the first th ings I read is the commodity  page." The guy was stunned, 
because he did too. This was back before commodities were commodities. He offered me a job, and 
when I turned him down, he almo st strangled me. This job inte rview was in 1970, and I was al-
ready trading commodities.

Chunk 3806 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
ready trading commodities. 
Going from ground zero in September 1970, wh ere did you start picking up tradingwise to 
build up to your ultimate trading success? 
My early losses taught me a lot. Since then—I don' t like to say this kind of thing—I have made 
very few mistakes. I learned quickly not to do anything unless you know what you are doing. I 
learned that it is better to do nothing and wait until you get a concept so right, and a price so right,

Chunk 3807 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that even if you are wro ng, it is not going to hurt you. 
Did you have a losing ye ar after that point? 
No. 
How did the Quantum Fund get started? 
George Soros was the senior partne r, and I was the junior partner. We started off with one senior 
partner, one junior part ner, and one secretary. 
How did you know George Soros? 
In 1970, I went to work for him at Amhold and S.  Bleichroeder. We left in 1973 because new

Chunk 3808 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
brokerage firm regulations did not  allow you to get a per centage of the trading profits. We could 
have stayed, but we couldn’t' t have managed mone y. So we had to leave—fortunately. We left and 
started our own firm. 
What kind of trading did you do  for the Quantum Fund? As I understand it, that fund was 
managed differently from the typical fund. 
We invested in stocks, bonds, currencies, co mmodities, everything— long and short—all over the 
world.

Chunk 3809 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
world. 
Did you and George make inde pendent trading decisions? 
No. If you broke down the division of labor, he  was the trader and I was the analyst. 
Did you come up with the idea, for example, shor ting the dollar, and did he decide the timing 
of when to do it? 
Yes, sort of. 
What if you disagreed on a market? Usually if we disagreed, we just did nothing. So, you both 
had to agree on a trade to do it?

Chunk 3810 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
had to agree on a trade to do it?  
There were no rules. Sometimes we would disagree and do the trade anyway, because one of us felt 
more strongly. But that type of scenario rarely came up, since we were usually in agreement, and 
once we worked things through, it was pretty clear that the trade was eith er right or wrong. When 
we thought something through, a consensus was formed. I hate to use that word, because consensus

Chunk 3811 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
investing is a disaster, but we almost  always seemed to come together. 
When you were trading leveraged products such  as commodities and currencies, how did you 
determine what your allocation was? 
Until we ran out of money, we were always leve raged to the hilt. When we bought something and 
ran out of money, we would look at  the portfolio and push out whatev er appeared to  be the least 
attractive item at that point. For example, if you wanted to buy corn a nd ran out of money, you

Chunk 3812 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
either had to stop buying corn or sell something else. It was an amoebic process. You know how 
amoebas grow—they grow out this way, then they run into pressure so th ey grow out the other 
way. It was a very amoebic portfolio.  149You never evaluated the risk of your positions on  an individual basis? So, if you lost money in 
one market and had to reduce your portfolio, you  might just as easily cut back in another 
market?

Chunk 3813 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
market? 
Right. We would always cut back on what we thought  were the least attractive positions in the 
portfolio. 
Even today, that sounds like a very unconve ntional fund. Back then, I imagine it was 
probably unique in terms of its investment strategy. 
It certainly was unique. I still don' t know anybody who trades all the markets. By all the markets, I 
mean all the currencies, commodities, bonds, and stocks—long and short—alloverthe world. I am

Chunk 3814 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
retired now, and I still do all these markets. People say to me, "You're retired? We have a full staff 
and can't even keep up with all these markets. What do you mean you ar e retired? You are short 
stocks all over the world!" 
I must admit, I find it amusing when you say you are retired. 
Now in my retirement, I'm more active than anybody, and people say, "How do you follow all these 
things?" 
I have the same question.

Chunk 3815 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
things?" 
I have the same question. 
I don't see how you can invest in American st eel without understandi ng what is going on in 
Malaysian palm oil. As I explained before, it is a ll part of a big, three-dimensional puzzle that is 
always changing. 
How do you find enough time to spend on all th ose markets? Just the reading itself seems to 
be a monumental chore. 
I do not do it nearly as ac tively as I used to. Over the years, I have spent a great deal of time

Chunk 3816 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
pouring a lot of stuff into my head. I have devel oped a great deal of pers pective on many markets. 
When I teach, students are always astonished by the range of historical markets that I am familiar 
with. I know about these markets because I have pored over many commodity, bond, and stock 
books so many times, for so many years. As an ex ample, I knew about the great bull market in 
cotton in 1861, when cotton went from \ cent to $1.05. 
How do you find out about a market like that?

Chunk 3817 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How do you find out about a market like that? 
I start by finding the anomalous years in a long-term  historical chart. When  I see a picture like the 
1861 cotton market, I ask myself, "Wha t caused that? Why did that happ en?" Then I try to figure it 
out. From that, you learn an enormous amount. 
In fact, one of the courses I teach  at Columbia, which the kids call "Bulls and Bears," requires each

Chunk 3818 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
student to find a major historical market move. It  doesn't matter which market, or whether the move 
was up or down. My instructions are for them to te ll me what one could have known at the time to 
see the big move coming. When rubber was at 2 cents everyone said, "How can rubber ever go 
up?" Yet it went up twelvefold. Somebody saw it. I al ways ask them, "What c ould you have seen at 
the time?" I always nail them. They will say, "I  knew the market would go up because there was

Chunk 3819 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
going to be a war." But I will make them tell me how they could have known at the time that there 
was a war coming. The course gives them historical  perspective across a broa d spectrum of markets 
and teaches them how to analyze. 
I have lived through or studied hun dreds, possibly even thousands, of bull and bear markets. In 
every bull market, whether it is IBM or oats, the bu lls always seem to come  up with reasons why it

Chunk 3820 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
must go on, and on, and on. I remember hearing hundreds of times, "We are going to run out of 
supply." "This time is going to be  different." "Oil has to sell at  $100 a barrel." "Oil is not a 
commodity [he laughs]." "Gold is different from  every other commodity." Well, damn, for 5,000 
years it has not been different from every other commodity. There have been some periods when 
gold has been very bullish, and other periods when it has gone down for many years. There is

Chunk 3821 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
nothing mystical about it. Sure, it has been a st ore of value, but so has wheat, corn, copper—
everything. All these things have been around for thous ands of years. Some ar e more valuable than 
others, but they are all commodities. They always have been, and they always will be. 
I guess the 1987 stock market is a prime recent example of the "this time is going to be  150different" complacency. 
Right. There was going to be a shortage of stoc ks again. In 1968, one of the major Wall Street

Chunk 3822 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
houses published a great learned th esis on why there was a shortage  of stocks developing, and why 
the bull market had to keep going up for years—ri ght at the top. In 1987, you started hearing it all 
over again: "There is a shortage of stocks, because ever ybody is buying in all this stock." At the 
bottom of the bear market [he begins a laugh that bu ilds steadily] there is going to be a shortage of 
money— I assure you—with a gi gantic surplus of stocks.

Chunk 3823 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
While editing this chapter, I came across the following item in a Time magazine story about the 
incredible bull market on the Tokyo Stock Exch ange (August 8, 1988, p. 29). One could hardly ask 
for a better current example of "this time is going to be different." The subj ect of the Japanese stock 
market actually comes up slightly later in this interview. 
The explosive growth worries some Western fina ncial experts, who fear that the boom could go

other markets, triggering another crash. Japanese st ocks are already trading at astronomical prices 
in comparison with the profits of the companies that issued the shares, at least by American 
standards. On the New York Stock Exchange, such price-earnings ratios run about 15 to 1, while in

Such worries are groundless, argue analysts in Tokyo. The Japanese at tribute the high price-

Japanese companies hold large bloc ks of other companies' stock, wh ich out of tradition are seldom 
traded, fewer shares are available for purchase so their prices rise. 
Is there a lot of similarity between di fferent cases of market hysteria? 
It's always the same cycle. When a market is ve ry low, there comes a time  when some peope buy it

Chunk 3827 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
because it has become undervalued. The market star ts to go up and more pe ople buy because it is a 
fundamentally sound thing to do or because the charts look good. In the next stage, people buy 
because it has been the thing to do. My mother calls me up and says, "Buy me XYZ stock." I ask 
her, "Why?" "Because the stock has tripled," she an swers. Finally, there comes the magical stage: 
People are hysterical to buy, because they know th at the market is going to go up forever, and

Chunk 3828 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
prices exceed any kind of rati onal, logical economic value. 
The whole process then repeats itself on the downside. The mark et gets tremendously overpriced 
and it starts to go down. More people sell because the fundament als are turning poor. As the 
economics deteriorate, more and more people sell. Next, people sell just because it has been the 
thing to do. Everybody knows it is going to go to nothing, so they sell. Then the market reaches the

investment, you usually have to wait a few years and let the market base. 
Talking about extreme bull markets, I recently read that Australia sold a l\ acre plot in Tokyo 
for $450 million that they bought for $250,000 twenty-five years ago. Is Japan the tulipmania

I guarantee that the Japanese st ock market is going to have a major collapse—possibly within the 
next year or two. Many of our st ocks are going to go down 80 to 90 percent in the bear market. A 
lot more of theirs are going to go down 80 to 90 percent. 
Is there any way the average U.S. trader can take advantage of that?

Short Japanese stocks, short Japane se indexes, short Japanese call s, buy Japanese puts. A lot of

major Japanese corporations which have options  traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. 
Although I think a collapse is coming, you have to be very careful about going short Japan, because

check; you could buy $100 million worth of stock that  way. It didn't matter. Everybody was doing 
it. In the end, there wa s a passport clerk who owned $10 billi on worth of stocks! All of it on 
postdated checks.

Although that market was a very clear  example of hysteria, I didn't sh ort it. I thought about it that

they would create rales so that I would never get my money out. Of  course, the market eventually

The clearinghouse is responsible. 
OK, fine, I'm happy to hear it. That 's the best news I've had in a long time. Still, whatever I do, I'm 
going to be careful. If the Japanese stock market goes from 30,000 to 24,000 or 20,000 that's fine. 
But you better think about getting out of it before the last b it if it goes to 12,000. If you wait that

Why did you leave the Quantum Fund? 
I didn't want to do the same thing for the rest of my life. I always wanted to have more than one 
career. When I came to New York in 1968,1 was a poor boy from Alabama. By 1979,1 had made 
more money than I knew existed in the world. Also, we were getting very big. We had started with 
three people, and by 1979, we had fifteen people. They wanted to know when they could go on

Chunk 3838 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
vacation, get raises, etc. I wasn't interested in any of that; I was interested in investing. I didn't want 
to get bigger. 
In September 1979,1 decided it would be my last year. But then, in Oct ober, there was a big 
collapse in the stock market, which we sailed right through. It was so much fun that I decided to 
stay on one more year. I left in 1980. 
Was 1980 the start of your "retirement"? 
Yes, in 1980,1 just cashed in my chips and retired.

Chunk 3839 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Is that the point you became an independent trader? 
The term I really prefer is "unemployed." 
Well, you teach at Columbia. 
That's unemployed. I did it as a part-time thing starting in 1983 so that  I could play squash. 
I thought it was the love of teaching. 
It has developed into much more. But when I starte d out, I didn't even want to teach. I just wanted 
to learn how to play squash. 
You're not being facetious? You actually started teaching so you could play squash?

Chunk 3840 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I'm dead serious. Columbia is right here and the D ean kept pestering me to teach a course. I told 
him, "I don't think people should go to business school." I thought that, for many people, business  152school was a waste of time. I stil l think so. But one thing I wanted  to learn in my retirement was 
how to play squash. So I made a deal with the Dean to teach one course per semester for free, in

smarter than I was—I'm still teaching. 
I take it, at this point, you really enjoy it. 
Oh, it's good fun, yes. And Columbia is terrific.  
What courses are you teaching? 
Security analysis, investment analysis, and the "B ulls and Bears" course we talked about before. 
Of the multitude of your trading experiences, do any stand out as particularly dramatic?

Chunk 3842 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Lots. My October 19 birthday present that I talk ed about earlier was proba bly the best. August 1982 
is another. I put a gigantic part of my net worth into bon ds throughout 1981 and 1982, and in 
August 1982, they skyrocketed. 
Any negative dramatic experiences? 
August 1971 was a very exciting time. We were long Japan and short America, and one Sunday 
night, Nixon announced that he was taking America off the gold standard. I didn't even know it had

Chunk 3843 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
happened. I had been off somewhere on my moto rcycle, and I came in Monday morning without 
having read the papers. That week the Japanese stock market went down 20 percent, and the U.S. 
stock market went up. We were  losing heavily on both sides. 
Did you have to liquidate your positions right off the bat? 
You can't liquidate at a time like that. Who can you sell to in Ja pan? Who could you buy from in

Chunk 3844 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the U.S.? If you covered your shorts, you made things  worse. In a situati on like that, you have to 
figure out whether you are right or  wrong. If there was going to be  a major fundamental change 
forever, the first loss is the be st loss. But if fundamentally you are basically correct, then you do 
nothing but sit there and let the market hysteria wash around you. 
Did you stay with your positions? 
Yes. 
So, you really had to ride out a rather treacherous paper loss.

Chunk 3845 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
There is no such thing as a paper loss . A paper loss is a very real loss. 
What was the analysis that gave you the confidence to stay with your positions? 
Our analysis was that this was not the end of the world. America had simply taken a short-term 
step, and it was not going to solve our country's long-term problems. 
Did that position actually turn out to be OK?    
It turned out fine. The Nixon announcement was ju st another step in the dissolution of the Bretton

Chunk 3846 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Woods Agreement [a 1944 international pact that, among ot her things, established guidelines for 
foreign exchange rate stabilization] and the decline of America. America was rallying in its own 
bear market. 
So, you saw it as a cosmetic move that wasn't going to change the trend, and you stayed with 
your position. 
Right. 
Is that a general principle: When government  measures are implemented to counteract a 
trend, you should sell the rally after the government action?

Chunk 3847 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Absolutely. It should be written down as an axiom that you always in vest against the central banks. 
When the central banks try to pr op up a currency, go the other way. 
What is the biggest public falla cy regarding market behavior? 
That the market is always right. The market is  nearly always wrong. I can assure you of that. 
What else? 
Never, ever, follow conventional wisdom in the ma rket. You have to lear n to go counter to the

Chunk 3848 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
markets. You have to learn how to  think for yourself; to be able to see that the emperor has no  153clothes. Most people can't do it. Most people want to follow a tr end. "The trend is your friend." 
Maybe that is valid for a few mi nutes in Chicago, but for the most  part, following what everyone 
else is doing is rarely a way to get rich. You may make money that way for a while, but keeping it 
is very hard.

Chunk 3849 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
is very hard. 
But actually, your whole style of trading involves staying with a t rend for years. So isn't what 
you are saying contradictory? 
That kind of trend—a trend that is economically  justified—is different. You have to see the 
supply/demand balance change earl y, buy early, and only buy markets that are going to go on for 
years. By "trend following," I meant buying a market  just because it goes up and selling it just be-
cause it goes down. 
What trading rules do you live by?

Chunk 3850 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
What trading rules do you live by? 
Look for hysteria to see if you shouldn't go the opposite way, but  don't go the opposite way until 
you have fully examined the situation. Also, rememb er that the world is always changing. Be aware 
of change. Buy change. You should be willing to  buy or sell anything. So many people say, "I 
could never buy that kind of stock," "I could neve r buy utilities," "I could never play commodities." 
You should be flexible and al ert to investing in anything.

Chunk 3851 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
If you were counseling the average investor, what would you tell him? 
Don't do anything until you know wh at you are doing. If you make 50 percent two years in a row 
and then lose 50 percent in the th ird year, you would actually be wors e off than if you just put your 
money in a money market fund. Wait for somethi ng to come along that you know is right. Then 
take your profit, put it back in the money mark et fund, and just wait agai n. You will come out way 
ahead of everybody else.

Are you ever wrong on a major position play? That  is, are one of your almost sure shots ever 
wrong, or are they so well selected that they just invariably go? 
I don't want to make it sound like I don't know how  to lose money—because I know how to lose 
money better than most people—but there has not been a major mistake in a long time. But you 
have to remember that I don't tr ade that often. It is not as though I'm ma king three decisions a

Chunk 3853 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
month. I may make three decisions a year, or fi ve decisions a year, a nd I'll stay with them. 
How often do you make a trade? 
Well, there is a difference between making a trad e and deciding to buy bonds  in 1981. I've owned 
bonds since 1981, but I sell around the position. I ma ke trades, but basically  I own them. I went 
short the dollar at the en d of 1984. Now, I have made a fair amount  of trades in currencies since the

Chunk 3854 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
end of 1984, but it is basically one tr ade with a lot of trades around it. 
Very few investors or traders are as successful  as you have been over time. What makes you 
different? 
I don't play. I just don't play. 
I can understand that. But still, very few peop le can analyze the same fundamentals you are 
looking at and so consistently be correct in assessing all the variables. 
Just don't do anything until you kn ow you've got it right. As an example, until you see American

Chunk 3855 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
agriculture hit a lo w, then no matter what happens in th e world—unless the world is going to stop 
eating—you can't go wrong. American agriculture is now so competitive, and so many marginal 
farmers have been washed out, that it has to go up. You just watch American agriculture 
deteriorate, deteriorate, deteri orate, and then you buy. You may buy early or late. In my case, 
usually a little bit early. Bu t, so what? The worst that ha ppens is you bought it too early. Who 
cares?

Chunk 3856 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
cares? 
Is there anything else besides the fact that you  are very selective that sets you apart? 
I have no boundaries. I am totally flexible. I am open to everything, and I pursue everything. I have 
no more compunction about speculating in Singapore dollars or shorting Malaysian palm oil than I 
do about buying General Motors. 
What happens when you have one scenario fo r currencies, one for the stock market, one for  154the bond market, and not everything meshes?

Chunk 3857 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Then I won't do anything. It happens all the ti me. I don't do anything until all the pieces fit. 
What is your opinion about chart reading? 
I haven't met a rich technician. Excluding, of course, technicians w ho sell their technical services 
and make a lot of money. 
Do you use charts yourself? 
Yes, I look at them every week. I use them fo r knowledge, to see what is going on. I learn a lot 
about what is going on in th e world by looking at charts.

Chunk 3858 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
But you don't ever look at charts and say, "I've seen this type of pattern before and it usually 
means the market is topping." 
I look at charts to see what has happened.  
Not what will happen? 
What has happened. If you don't know what has ha ppened, you'll never know what is going to 
happen. The charts say to me that there is a runaway bull market. They give me facts, but that's it. I 
don't say—what is that term you used  earlier, reversal?—th ere is a reversal he re. I don't even know

Chunk 3859 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
what a reversal is. 
A reversal simply is— 
Don't tell me. It might mess up my mind. I don't know  about those things, and I don't want to know. 
Do the markets behave any differently now b ecause so much money is being managed by 
trend-oriented systems? 
No. They may not always have been on a comput er, but there always have been systems. I 
guarantee that you can go back 100 y ears in the market and not find a single decade where there

Chunk 3860 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
hasn't been some kind of system, some kind of  new formula developed to play the markets. 
So the markets today are basi cally the same as the market s in the 1970s, 1960s, and 1950s. 
The same as the markets in the nineteenth centu ry. The same things make markets go up and down. 
They have not changed the rules of supply and demand. 
Do you have any goals at this point? 
I'm looking for adventure. I'd like to be able to  wean myself more and more from the markets.

Chunk 3861 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
There are two problems. First, investing is such a wonderful pastime that it is hard to give up. I 
haven't changed from when I was twenty-two y ears old. I always want ed to read and know 
everything that was going on and figure out the futu re. The second problem is what do I do with my 
funds if I just stop? If I turn it  over to my friendly broker at XYZ, I would be broke in five years, 
and then I would have to go back to work. 
Any last words?

Chunk 3862 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Any last words? 
Good investing is really just common sense. But it is astonishing how few people have common 
sense—how many people can look at the exact same  scenario, the exact same facts and not see 
what is going to happen. Ninety percent of th em will focus on the same thing, but the good inves-

conventional wisdom is not very common.

Chunk 3863 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
conventional wisdom is not very common. 
 
Jim Rogers' unique approach may be difficult to emulate in its entirety, but many of his trading 
principles are of great relevance to all traders. His basic concepts are: 
1. Buy value. If you buy value, you will not lose much even if your timing is wrong. 
2. Wait for a catalyst. Bottoming markets can go nowhere for ve ry long periods of time. To avoid

Chunk 3864 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
tying up your money in a dead market, wait until there is a catalyst to change the market direction. 
3. Sell hysteria. This principle is sound, but its applica tion is far from easy. Rogers' methodology 
can be paraphrased as follows: Wait for hysteria, examine to see whether the market is wrong, go 
against the hysteria if fundamenta lly validated, be sure you are right, and then hold on tight. The

Chunk 3865 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
tricky parts are the last two steps.  Very few traders have Rogers' analytical skills and intuitive 
insights to wade through the maze of facts and stat istics in the "three-dimensional puzzle" of world  155markets and arrive at the correct long- term projections with uncanny high ac 
curacy. Without this type of accuracy, the ability to  sit tight could be a lethal virtue. And, even if 
you can predict long-term economic trends with a su fficient degree of accura cy, there still remains

Chunk 3866 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the problem of being able to sit tight, particularly when the financial steamroller of market hysteria 
is running counter to your position. 
For example, I doubt many traders would have been able to sell  gold at $675, stay short while it 
surged to $875 in only four days, and then ho ld the position through the subsequent long-term 
collapse, eventually liquidating at a large profit. Even if you have the steel nerves necessary to

Chunk 3867 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
duplicate this feat, you probably lack the financial resources to outstay  this type of market or the 
same high degree of accuracy in picking your shot s. Perhaps this particul ar concept should come 
with a caution label attached: Warning! Any atte mpts by the unskilled practitioner to apply the 
method described herein can lead to financial ruin. 
4. Be very selective. Wait for the right trade to come along. Ne ver trade for trading's sake. Have the

Chunk 3868 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
patience to sit on your money until the high probability trade sets up exactly right. 
5. Be flexible. Biases against certain markets or types of trades limit your field of opportunity. A 
trader who says, "I will never go short," has a distinct disadvantage compared to the trader who is 
willing to go short as well as long. The trader who is open to examining a broad range of markets 
has a distinct advantage over someone who is willing to participate in only one market.

Chunk 3869 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
6. Never follow conventional wisdom. Keep this principle in mi nd and you will be less likely to buy 
stocks after the Dow has already moved from 1, 000 to 2,600 and everyone is  convinced that there 
is a shortage of stocks. 
7. Know when to hold and when to  liquidate a losing position. If you believe the market is going 
against you because your orig inal analysis was flawed (such as  when you realize you overlooked an

Chunk 3870 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
important fundamental factor), then  as Rogers states: "T he first loss is the best loss." However, if 
the market is going against you, but you are convinced your original analysis wa s right, then sit out 
the hysteria. As a cautionary word, th is latter condition s hould be applied only by traders who fully 
understand the risks involved.

156Mark Weinstein-High-Percentage Trader 
After a brief period as a real es tate broker, Mark Weinstein becam e a full-time trader. His start in 
trading was so naive that he vi rtually threw his money away. Afte r that early failure, Weinstein 
withdrew to seriously study the ma rkets and earn another trading st ake. With the exception of one 
disastrous trading experience, Weinstein was a successful trader  from that point on. He has

Chunk 3872 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
intensively traded a wide variety of markets, in cluding stocks, stock options, stock index futures, 
currencies, and commodities. Although he is reluctant to divulge specifi c details, it is clear that he 
has profited handsomely in all these trading arenas. 
I met Mark Weinstein through a mutual friend. A lthough he was very intrigued by the project, his 
desire for anonymity made him reluctant to tell hi s story. He would call me and say, "OK, I will do

Chunk 3873 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
it, let's schedule the interview." Then the next day he would call and say, "I changed my mind. I 
don't want the publicity." This pattern was repeat ed several times, with each decision accompanied 
by lengthy phone conversations regarding the merits and drawbacks of doing the interview. Finally, 
in exasperation, I said, "Mark, we  could have done three intervie ws in the time we have spent 
talking about it." That was our last conversation regarding the matter until about two months later

when, impressed by the caliber of traders who had agreed to part icipate in this book, Weinstein 
decided to do the interview. 
Weinstein met me at my office one summer ev ening. Because the building turns off the air-

How did you first get involved in trading? 
Back in 1972, when I was a real estate broker, I had a friend who was a commodity broker. He and 
I had gone to school together. 
Did your friend get you interested in the markets? 
It didn't take much to get me interested be cause my father's hobby was gambling. He was very 
good at percentages, and I used to watch him at the cr ap tables. In a sense, I think being a trader is

Chunk 3877 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):

college and because I had a commodity broker  friend who was into computer strategies. 
Do you remember your first trade? 
I remember it exactly. I opened up a commodity account with $8,400, and I went long corn based 
on a recommendation made by the firm's grain an alyst. Three days later, I was out $7,800. 
Did your broker friend advise you to follow the analyst's recommendation?

Yes, and he also followed it. What I didn't realize then was that the market had been rising for some 
time and was already overbought when  I went long. It wasn't even a bad reaction. I just got in on 
the move too late. I didn't have enough margin to  keep the position going. Also, my guts turned on 
me, and I didn't want to put up any more money. 
It sounds to me like your friend let you put on a position that was clearly out of line with any 
money management principles.

Chunk 3879 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
money management principles. 
It was one of those get-rich-quick schemes. 
Did you know anything abou t the markets at the time? 
Absolutely nothing. If I flipped th rough a chart book, it looked like a co llection of TV test patterns 
to me. 
Did you have any idea of the risk involved? 
I knew that the chances of my winning were ve ry slim because I didn't know what I was doing.  157Didn't it occur to you that you should  learn something before you started?

Chunk 3880 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
No, because I was desperate for a change; I didn't like being a real estate broker. 
Was the money that you invested a substa ntial part of your savings at the time? 
It was all the money I had. 
When did you get enough money to  come back into the markets? 
It took me approximately six or seven months. I worked seven days a week and rented as many 
apartments as I could get my hands on. I also sold  a few co-ops. By that time, I had saved up about

Chunk 3881 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
$24,000.1 took out $4,000 to live on, and used the remaining $20,000 to open an account. 
Did you make any effort to learn anythi ng about the markets in the interim? 
Yes. I studied the gold market, learned how to chart, and became familiar with the concept of 
overbought and oversold markets. I figured that if  I bought a severely overs old market and left 
myself enough money for two margin calls, I coul dn't lose unless something drastic happened in 
the economy. That was my method.

Chunk 3882 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the economy. That was my method. 
But if you use that approach in a trendi ng market, you are going to get killed. 
It worked in that market. I guess ignorance was bliss.  
What were your trading results the second time around? 
I did well for several years after that and managed to bu ild a small fortune. But a lot of that was due 
to luck. 
It couldn't have all been luck. What were you doing right when you were making money?

Chunk 3883 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
In relation to what I know now, there was very little that I was doing right. I think I just had good 
markets. In those days, commodities seemed to fo llow chart patterns a lot better than they do now. 
Very few people knew anything about technical an alysis then, so the markets were much more 
orderly. I got a break by learning as  much as I could about technical analysis at a time when it was 
working pretty well. 
Did you have a method for controlling risk?

Chunk 3884 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Did you have a method for controlling risk?  
No, and I still don't. I depended on my nervous syst em and gut reaction. I covered positions when I 
did not feel right about them. Sometimes it would be after two days; sometimes after two hours. 
Were you spending all day trading? 
All day and all night. I was losing friends left a nd right. I sat in a studio apartment with charts 
plastered on every wall. I pr obably looked like a madman to  the friends I had left.

Chunk 3885 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
So this was really a full-time endeavor. 
Not only an endeavor—it was an ob session! I slept with it; I dreamt about it. Sometimes I would 
stay up all night thinking about what I would do th e next day. If I didn't need sleep, I would have 
done it twenty-four hours a day. At that point, it wa sn't the money that was motivating me. I was 
hooked on the game: on the challenge of trying to figure out the market.

Chunk 3886 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Did you sometimes wake up with a feeling that you knew the gold market was going higher or 
anything like that? 
No, it had nothing to do with the di rection of the market. It was just an extension of what I was 
doing during the day. I would take so  much of it to sleep that I ended up exploring unconsciously 
what I had been doing consciously that day. 
Did you have any goals when you set out?

Chunk 3887 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Did you have any goals when you set out? 
Well, the great American dream is to make a million dollars, and that was particularly true in those 
days. I never really had a materialistic dream unt il I started vacationing and traveling in Europe. 
When was this? How many years after you started trading? 
It was in the mid-1970s. I had been trad ing for about three or four years.  
Had you passed the million do llar mark by that point?

Chunk 3888 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yes, and I had made enough money to be able to relax, start vacationing, a nd think about things I 
wanted to buy. At that point, I was feeling conf ident enough to know that I could replace the money  158I spent with my trading profits. I figured the next logical step was to start appreciating the money I 
was making. I saw a castle in the south of France th at I wanted. I was partic ularly impressed that

Chunk 3889 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the castle had a moat around it, and the idea of living there appealed to me. It  was on the market for 
only $350,000, and I figured it would take about $50,000 a year to keep it up. 
That doesn't sound like a lo t of money for a castle. 
Today it is probably worth $5 million. When I came b ack to the U.S., I wanted to make the money 
to pay for the castle almost immediately. That was a tremendous mistake.

Chunk 3890 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I don't understand. You already had the money to buy the castle; you didn't have to make it. 
Even though I had the money, I still looked at it in terms of how much it cost. I know people in this 
business who have $17 million in their tr ading account and won't buy a new car. 
So you didn't take your money out of the account to buy the castle. 
No, I came back and decided that making the money was going to be my goal.

Chunk 3891 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
In other words, your next $350,000 in pr ofits was going to go for the castle. 
Exactly. 
What happened? 
On my next trade, I put on a large long position in  soybeans. The market closed up the first day, 
and I had about a 25 percent profit on my money. I was planning to get out of the position at the 
end of the week. The biggest mistake I made was ha ving a specific target of what I wanted out of 
the trade.

Chunk 3892 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the trade. 
The target being determined not by market analysis, but rather by the $350,000 you wanted 
to make on the trade. Did you trade differently because you were trying to make money for a 
specific purpose? 
Yes, I didn't consider the risk and took on too large a position. I wa s not using any type of rational 
judgment. I was being guided by my material desire s. The market went up again the next day, but 
collapsed suddenly late in the session, locking limit-down.

Chunk 3893 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Did you get stuck with your position at limit-down? 
Yes, I couldn't get out. The next day I showed up at the brokerage office and the market opened 
offered limit-down. I waited all day to see if it would come off of locked limit-down, but it didn't. 
I take it that you would have liquida ted your position if you could have. 
If the market had traded, I would have sold out at any price.  
Do you remember your emotions at the time?

Chunk 3894 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Do you remember your emotions at the time? 
I was in a state of shock and had no decision-m aking capability left whatsoever. I couldn't fall 
asleep, and found myself almost praying the mark et would somehow trade the next day. On the 
third day, I called the office about a half an hour before the opening, and they told me it didn't look 
like there was any hope. I didn't even bother going in because I couldn't face the people in the

Chunk 3895 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
office. I was certain that they were ge tting a big thrill out of my situation. 
Why is that? 
There were a few other professiona l traders in the office who were never able to make the kind of 
money I had been making. When this situation devel oped, they were almost relieved. It seemed to 
justify all those years of their not taking positions like I did. They were really heartless. The only 
person who was really upset was my broker, and, fr ankly, that was probably because he was afraid

Chunk 3896 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
of losing the account. 
Did the other traders kid you about it? 
They over consoled me and then laughed about it behind my back. They wanted to see me come in 
and fall apart. That is why I stopped coming to the office. 
Do you think they relished your predicament because it made th em seem less deficient as 
traders? 
It went beyond that. I think there are a lot of people in this busi ness who just enjoy watching others

Chunk 3897 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
lose money.  159Once you stopped going into the office, what did you do during the day? 
I checked with other brokerage hous es, trying to get price quotes.  
Why didn't you just call your ow n broker? I was too embarrassed,  and I didn't want to take 
the derision. Your own broker was kidding you?  
I didn't know what to think of him. I was starting to get paranoid and hostile because nothing could

Chunk 3898 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
be done. I went to a competing firm and spoke to their grains analyst. I was looking for someone to 
hold my hand. He told me I would be OK, becaus e the fundamentals were still strong and there 
would be a tremendous demand for soybeans if the market went down another day. Of course, on 
the fourth day, the market  locked limit-down again. 
How much were you losing each day? 
About $ 125 thousand a day. This  was at a time when the av erage annual salary was $15,000.1 was

Chunk 3899 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
not born rich, and I couldn't stop thi nking of my loss in those terms. 
Could you put that loss in perspect ive relative to your account size? 
Before that trade, I had nearly $1.5 million in my  trading account. So I wa s losing nearly 10 percent 
of my equity level prior to the trade each day. 
I was devastated. I felt like I was wounded in a trench and watc hing myself bleed to death. The 
market went limit-down five days in a row, and I lost over $600,000. On the fifth day, I remember

Chunk 3900 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
sitting in a park holding hands with a girl I had picked up, li terally crying on her lap. I was 
practically in a psychotic state. I thought about getting out of the business altogether . I started to 
think that what everybody was telling me was true—m aybe it was just luck that I had made money 
all those years. I worried that if  I continued trading, I could wind up losing it a ll, and being forced 
to go back to some job I didn't like.

Chunk 3901 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to go back to some job I didn't like. 
Which was more devastating, the large monetary  loss, or your feelings about going from 
success to failure? 
It was the money and the limit situation, and the fact that I couldn't act. My exact thoughts were: 
Here I am, a person who thought it was un-American to go short, and what  I found out was really 
un-American was not being able to get out of a position. 
So you felt cheated by not being able to get out?

Chunk 3902 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I definitely felt cheated. To this day, I think there is something wrong with limit price moves. 
Are you implying that price lim its that were supposedly created to  protect the public actually 
work against them by preventi ng people from getting out of their losing positions? 
Yes. I think the market should be totally free of restraints. 
There is talk about putting limits on stock mark ets as a way of reducing volatility. Would that 
actually be jumping from the frying pan into the fire?

Chunk 3903 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Absolutely. Now, the average invest or knows that if he wants to get out, he can at l east get out at 
some price. Imagine if this guy calls his broker and finds out that  he can't even get out of the 
market. 
In other words, you are saying that those who are expounding the idea of limits are really 
going to make matters worse for the small investor. 
It is absolute lunacy. It is a la w that is being proposed for the be nefit of sophistic ated institutional 
investors.

Chunk 3904 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
investors. 
Your earlier comment implied that, prior to th e soybean trade, you always traded the long 
side of the markets. Is that right? 
Yes. I never went short. I felt it was un-America n. After the soybean trade,  I realized that the 
business I was in was the height of capitalism, and it really made no difference what side of the 
market you were on. All I could think about was that  the people who were short made money and I 
lost money.

Chunk 3905 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
lost money. 
How long did the emotional impact of this experience last? 
Months. I didn't want to trade commodities anymore.  I ripped every chart off my walls. I tore up 
everything in my house that had anything to do with commodities.  160When did you begin trading again? 
After a few months, I started tr ading AMEX stocks, but I found it  amazingly slow. I missed the 
leverage of the commodity markets. I didn't th ink I could successfully support myself trading 
stocks.

Chunk 3906 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
stocks. 
Around that time, I ran into a friend  who is a great options trader. I told him about my experiences 
and he suggested that I join him. In my first we ek at his office he told  me to buy Teledyne calls 
right before expiration because he was sure they  were going up. I followed hi s advice, and the calls 
completely collapsed. 
How much did you lose? 
About $40,000.1 felt extremely hostile, but I didn't want  to show it because he never promised me

Chunk 3907 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
any results. I was so upset that I walked out of the office and didn't come back for two days. He 
tried reaching me during that time, but I didn't re turn his calls. Finally, he  got a message to me 
through a mutual friend. 
Was he upset that he had given you bad advice? 
When I came back to the office, he told me th at he had done the exact opposite trade in another 
account, and that the trade was mine. So I didn't really lose any money.

Chunk 3908 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
That sounds like an awfully odd type of practical joke. 
It wasn't a practical joke. He was trying to teach me not to place blind trust in anyone—even him. It 
was his way of teaching me the importance  of self-reliance in being a good trader. 
How did you do after that point? 
I did pretty well. My friend was a phenomenal op tions trader. He knew ever ything about the market 
and I learned a tremendous amount from him. 
Did you trade options based on th e methodologies he taught you?

Chunk 3909 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yes, combined with my own technical analysis.  
Your friend didn't use technical analysis? 
No, he didn't believe in it . He was a tape reader. 
Has the fact that you have been extraordinarily  successful as a 100 p ercent technical trader 
changed his mind about technical analysis? 
Not at all. He thinks technical analysis is just a crutch for me, and the real reason I make money is 
experience. There was a point at which we separated for a few year s. He came to my office one day

Chunk 3910 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
and watched me trade. He embraced me like a father and said, "You finally made it." I told him that 
not only had I gained a lot of experience, but I had learned just about everything there was about 
technical analysis, including certain things I had created myself. He said, "You never give up, do 
you? It has nothing to do with t echnical analysis. You are trading that way because of experience." 
Why did you and your option trad ing friend eventually separate?

Chunk 3911 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
There was a conflict in our tradin g styles. He was a great trader  who was willing to take an 
occasional large loss, because he knew he would more than make up for it with large gains and 
come out way ahead in the long ran. However, I was uncomfortable trading that way. I preferred 
trading for small profits and trying to eradicate losi ng trades. I wasn't willing to take the same type 
of risk. Also, my approach was purely technical, whereas he was basically a tape reader. Anyway,

Chunk 3912 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
in 1980,1 decided to go off on my own. We  got together again years later. 
I know you once entered an options trading contest. Can you tell me about it? 
It was originally organized by two traders on the СВОЕ  floor. They got 47 traders together, each of 
whom put up $5,000 in a winner-take -all contest. Each trader opened a $100,000 account with the 
same clearing firm. 
How long was the contest for? 
Three months. 
What were your results?

Chunk 3913 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Three months. 
What were your results? 
I turned the $100,000 into over $900,000 without any pyramiding [using profits to increase  161leverage]. 
That's a rather phenomenal performance. 
Yes, but the markets were very good at that time. 
What did you trade when you went out on your own in 1980? 
I traded everything. I continued to  trade stock options. When stock index futures trading began in

Chunk 3914 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the early 1980s, that became a primary market for me . I also traded the comm odity markets. In fact, 
during the last two years, my trading has shifted to nearly 90 percent commodities. 
Do you remember your first soybean tr ade after the debacle in the 1970s? 
For a long time, I avoided soybeans.  But, as I began to find myse lf trading the commodity markets 
effortlessly, I knew deep down that I would eventu ally get back the money I lost in soybeans. I 
never forgot about it.

Chunk 3915 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
never forgot about it. 
It sounds like you were looking for revenge. 
Yes, exactly. Every time I looked at a commodity  chart book, my eyes would edge over to the 
soybean chart, then I would quickly flip the pa ge. I watched the market peripherally for years 
before doing anything. When soybeans went do wn to $4.75,1 knew they were near a low, but I 
didn't want to buy them until I was sure I couldn't lo se on the trade. I was lik e a Sicilian whose wife

Chunk 3916 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
had been murdered ten years earlier, waiting for the perfect moment for revenge. When my 
technical analysis convinced me that the market  had bottomed for real, I jumped in on the long 
side. 
Where did you buy the beans? 
Around $6.18. [This was shortly before the 1988 drought caused prices to skyrocket.] 
Where did you get out? 
I got out of some at $7.25, and the rest at $9.92. [The high of the move was $10.46.] 
How much did you make on that trade?

Chunk 3917 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How much did you make on that trade? 
Let's just say I made my money back in spades. 
The way you talk about it, it sounds like  that trade was a great relief for you. 
Yes, it was a total catharsis. I realized that there was a reason why I had lost the money in the first 
place. 
What was the reason? 
Because I was inexperienced. I don't believe anyone ever gets wiped out in the market because of

Chunk 3918 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
bad luck; there is always some other reason for it.  Either you were off when you did the trade, or 
you didn't have the experience. There is always a mistake involved. 
You mentioned earlier that one of the reasons you split with your form er trading partner was 
that your own trading style was geared to extr emely low risk. Since 1980, what was the worst 
percentage drawdown you  have experienced? 
I lose so infrequently that I don't really  keep track of that type of number.

Chunk 3919 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Well, let's put it this way: What was your worst single trading month? 
I haven't had any losing months. 
You have made money in every single month since 1980!     , 
Yes. Of course, I could have made  a lot more money if I wasn't so cautious, but that is the way I 
trade. 
Do you remember your worst losing week? 
I haven't had any losing weeks during that  time, but I have had some losing days. 
That is an incredible statement.  How can you be sure that you a re not simply forgetting about

Chunk 3920 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
a few weeks when you lost money trading? 
The reason I am sure is that I remember all my lo sses. For example, I have had three losing days in 
the last two years. Out of the thou sands of trades I made during that  time, I had 17 losers, but nine 
of them were because my quote machine was down, and when that happens I just get out of my  162position. 
Most traders would be happy winning on 50 p ercent of their trades, and a win ratio of 75

Chunk 3921 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
percent would be spectacular, yet you are implying that your win ratio  is somewhere in the vicinity 
of 99 percent—that is re ally hard to believe.  
You can check with Leigh. I told him about hundr eds of my trades during the past few years. 
[Leigh Stevens is a mutual friend who introduced me to Weinstein.] 
OK reader, I know what you are saying: '"No losing w eeks, but I've had some losing days.' Give me

Chunk 3922 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
a break." Frankly, I admit Weinstein's statements sound preposterous. I could not verify his claims 
by examining account statements because his pa rtners are vigorous in maintaining the 
confidentiality of the partnership's trading activity as it is a private trading firm, not open to the 
public. In fact, a number of his partners were adam antly opposed to this interview and were nearly 
successful in dissuading Weinstein from partic ipating. The only account statement Weinstein was

Chunk 3923 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
willing, or able, to show me was his independen t entry in the option trading contest, which did 
indeed confirm that he multiplied a $ 100,000 account ninefold in three months with 100 percent 
winning trades. 
Still unsatisfied, I spoke to Le igh, who has known Weinstein for years and has spent many days 
watching him trade. I have known Leigh for three y ears and can confidently describe him as honest,

Chunk 3924 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
low-keyed, and levelheaded. Leigh confirmed that  of about 100 of Weinstein's trades he had 
personally witnessed and several hundred more Wein stein told him about on the phone (right after 
he put them on), he could remember only one that wa s a loser. Even if because of faulty memory (I 
mean this literally, not as a euphemism for dis honesty), Weinstein's actual percentage winning rate 
is somewhat lower than he implies, I still be lieve his win/loss rati o is incredibly high.

Chunk 3925 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How can he do it? Weinstein's own response to this  query follows, but to put it in perspective, I 
thought some further elaboration would be helpfu l. Weinstein employs his own custom-designed 
state-of-the-art computer systems to monitor cons tantly technical indicators designed to measure 
changes in market momentum. Rather than use the standard values for thes e indicators, Weinstein 
uses his own values, which he frequently adjusts for changing market conditions. He combines this

Chunk 3926 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
intensive real-time analysis with comprehensiv e chart analysis incorporating a variety of 
methodologies, including cycles, Fibonacci retracements, and Elliott Wave analysis. Finally, add to 
this one last essential ingredient: an uncanny sense of market  timing. Only when nearly everything 
lines up right and he feels the ti ming is virtually perfect does he put on a trade. He passes up many 
trades that he believes have a high probability of  working, but for which he lacks the same degree

Chunk 3927 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
of near absolute confidence. Because of the combination of a lifetime devotion to studying the 
markets, intensive real-time analysis, innate mark et sense and incredibly rigorous trade selection, 
virtually all of Weinstein's trades  are at least marginally profitabl e at some point within twenty 
minutes of entry. That is all Weinstein need s to assure a breakeven or better result. 
It helps to understand that Wein stein usually plays for quick profits  and covers his trades within

Chunk 3928 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
hours or even minutes. Even on position trades, Wein stein will usually take so me profits quickly to 
assure a net profitable outcome. He also trades markets in rotation, quickly shifting his profits from 
market to market, always seeking the profit poten tial with the lowest perceived risk. Finally, 
Weinstein enjoys the support of a floor network th at often puts him on the right side of the bid-
asked spread.

Chunk 3929 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
asked spread. 
Weinstein's comments may sound like boasting on the written page, but that belies their tone—
naiveté would be a much closer description. When  Weinstein talks about trades, his comments are 
peppered with phrases such as, "It's obvious the mark et is going lower," "This market is so easy." It 
is clear he has no conception of how di fficult trading is for the rest of us. 
How do you explain your ability to win such a high percentage of the time?

Chunk 3930 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Because I have a real fear of the markets. I have  found that the greatest tr aders are the ones who are 
most afraid of the markets. My fear of the markets has forced me  to hone my timing with great 
precision. When I am trading proper ly, it is like a pool player r unning racks. If my gut feel of 
market conditions is not right, I don't trade. My  timing is a combination of experience and my 
nervous system. If my nervous system tells me to get out of the position, it is because the market

Chunk 3931 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
action triggers something in my knowledge and experience that I have seen before.  163I also don't lose much on my trades, because I wa it for the exact right mo ment. Most people will 
not wait for the environment to tip itself off. They will walk into the forest when it is still dark, 
while I wait until it gets light. Although the cheetah is  the fastest animal in the world and can catch

Chunk 3932 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
any animal on the plains, it will wait until it is abso lutely sure it can catch its prey. It may hide in 
the bush for a week, waiting for just the right moment. It will wait for a baby antelope, and not just 
any baby antelope, but preferably on e that is also sick or lame. Only then, when there is no chance 
it can lose its prey, does it a ttack. That, to me, is the epitome of professional trading.

When I trade at home, I often watch the sparrows in  my garden. When I feed them bread, they take 
just a little piece at a time and fl y away. They keep on flying back and forth, taking small bits of 
bread. They may have to make a hundred stabs at a piece of bread to get what a pigeon gets at one 
time, but that is why a pigeon is a pigeon. You will ne ver be able to shoot a sparrow, it is just too

fast. That is the way I day trade. For example, there are times during the day when I am sure that 
the S&P is going up, but I don't try to  pick the bottom, and I am out before it tops. I just take the 
mid-range where the momentum is greatest. Th at, to me, is trading like a sparrow eats. 
Am I paraphrasing you correctly? The cheetah is your analogy for position trading and the 
sparrow is your analogy for day trading. The common denominator is that both animals wait

Chunk 3935 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
for can't-lose circumstances. 
Exactly. 
How do you pick your trades? 
I use many different types of te chnical input: charts, Elliott Wa ve and Gann analysis, Fibonacci 
numbers, cycles, sentiment, moving averages, and various oscillators. Peopl e think that technical 
analysis is unreliable because they tend to pick  the one thing they are comfortable with. The 
problem is that no single technica l approach works all the time. You have to know when to use 
each method. 
How do you do that?

Chunk 3936 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
each method. 
How do you do that? 
It is experience and gut feel. I use all forms of technical analysis, but in terpret them through gut 
feel. I do not believe in mathematical systems that always approach markets in the same way. 
Using myself as the "system," I constantly cha nge the input to achieve  the same output—profit! 
Is there anything you can single out as the most  important element in deciding to put on a 
trade?

Chunk 3937 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trade? 
I am always looking for a market that is losing momentum, and then go the other way. 
Having traded both the stock and commod ity markets, would you say they behave 
differently? 
Absolutely. In contrast to the commodity market s, the stock market very rarely gives you the 
opportunity to enjoy a meaningful trend. 
Why is that? 
Because when institutions and specialists sell out, they don't sell out at one price level, they scale

Chunk 3938 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
out as the market goes up. Similarly, when they  buy, they scale in as the market goes down. This 
leads to choppier price action a nd is the reason why many good comm odity traders that I know lose 
every time they go into the stock market. 
But you win consistently in the stock market , as well. What are you doing differently? 
I don't try to figure out where the ma rket is going before the action; I let the market tell me where it

Chunk 3939 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
is going. Also, there is such a variety of technical input in the stock market (divergence, 
advance/decline, sentiment, put/call ratios, and so  on), that you will almost  always get a signal 
before the market is about to do something. 
Is your method of technical an alysis therefore different in the stock market than in the 
commodity markets? 
I look at the indivi dual stocks; they al l have their own pers onalities. For exampl e, IBM and General

Chunk 3940 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Motors will usually rally before a major market bo ttom and fail to rally before a major market top. 
As another example, I have never seen a real good rally without the utilit ies leading the market.  164The utilities go up when interest rates are expected to come down, and when interest rates come 
down, portfolio managers jump into stocks. I have done extremely well trading the indexes, 
because before I ever traded inde x futures, I had become a very e xperienced trader of stocks and

Chunk 3941 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
options. 
What do you think is the public's bigge st misconception about the markets? 
That people who trade the markets gamble. I know floor traders that have made money for twenty 
straight years. You can 't call that gambling. 
Another major misconception is that people always  expect the market to react to news. For 
example, when John F. Kennedy was assassinated, th e market initially broke very sharply, but then

Chunk 3942 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
quickly rebounded to new highs. This price action ba ffled many people. Inve stors who sold on the 
news only to watch the market reverse blamed th e institutions for pushing the market higher. What 
they failed to realize is that a market that is fundamentally and technicall y poised to move higher is 
not going to reverse direction because of a news item—even a dramatic one. 
Another item I would place under the category of misconceptions is the way the media reports the

Chunk 3943 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
reasons for the market being down. They are always  saying that the market is down because of 
profit taking. I think it would be wonderful if ever ybody was always taking profits. But, the truth is, 
most people lose money, and the reason markets go down is because they take their losses. I know 
educated people who watch the news and wonder w hy the hell they lost m oney when everyone else 
is taking profits. The media owes it to the public to report that the market goes down not only on

Chunk 3944 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
profit taking, but on a lot of loss taking as well. 
What are the trading rules you live by? 
1. Always do your homework. 
2. Don't be arrogant. When you get arrogant, you forsak e risk control. The best  traders are the most 
humble. 
3. Understand your limitations. Everyone has limitations—even the best traders. 
4. Be your own person. Think against the herd, as they must lose in time. Don't trade until an

Chunk 3945 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
opportunity presents itself. Knowing when to stay  out of the markets is as important as knowing 
when to be in them. 
5. Your strategy has to be flexib le enough to change when the environment changes. The mistake 
most people make is they keep the same strategy  all the time. They say, "Damn, the market didn't 
behave the way I thought it would. " Why should it? Life and the ma rkets just don't work that way.

Chunk 3946 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
6. Don't get too complacent once you have made profits . The toughest thing in the world is holding 
on to profits. That is because once you have atta ined a goal, you then set a second goal that is 
usually the same as the first one: to make more  money. Consequently, for many people, attainment 
of that second goal is no t as rewarding. They may begin to que stion what they really want from 
trading and trigger a se lf-destruct process in which they wind up losing.

Chunk 3947 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Any final advice you have for the beginning trader? 
You have to learn how to lose; it  is more important than learni ng how to win. If you think you are 
always going to be a winner, when you lose, you will develop feelings of hostility and end up 
blaming the market instead of trying to learn why you lost. 
Limit losses quickly. To paraphrase from Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, most traders hold on

Chunk 3948 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to their losses too long because they hope the loss will not get larger. They take profits too soon, 
because they fear the profit will  diminish. Instead, traders should fear a larger loss and hope for a 
larger profit. 
Weinstein's most traumatic trading experience occurr ed when he let a material goal interfere with 
his trading. This is a common theme that has surfaced in other interviews. It invariably seems to be

Chunk 3949 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
a mistake to translate the potential profit or loss of a trade into material terms. 
The cornerstone of Weinstein's trading approach is  to wait for those trades in which everything 
appears to be lined up exactly  right, and the odds  of winning seem overwhelming. Even though 
most of us can never expect to remotely approach Weinstein's conf idence in the trades he selects, 
the concept of waiting for only thos e trades one feels most confiden t about is sound advice that is

Chunk 3950 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
echoed by a number of traders in this book. 
Although viewing markets as nonrandom over the long run, I have long belie ved that very short- 165term market fluctuations (i.e., intraday pri ce movements) were larg ely random. Weinstein has 
shaken this belief.

  168Brian Gelber-Broker Turned Trader 
Brian Gelber began his career as a broker, managing a major brokerage firm's financial futures 
operations on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade. After successfully advising institutional 
clients, he began trading for his own account. In the early days of T-bond futures trading, Gelber 
enjoyed the dual distinction of being one of the most (if not the most) prominent brokers on the

Chunk 3952 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
floor and one of the la rgest local traders. 
In January 1986, Gelber expanded his trading to include the direct management of customer 
accounts. In addition to his own trading, Gelber supervises a gr oup of traders in both cash and 
futures in government securities and othermarkets. He is the pres ident of a group of companies: 
Gelber Group, Gelber Management, and Gelber Securities. These companies are involved in 
clearing, brokerage, and money management.

Chunk 3953 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
clearing, brokerage, and money management. 
Gelber's relaxed personality seem ed almost out of place with hi s profession. Instead of the high 
level of intensity expected of someone who trad es and supervises trading in multimillion dollar 
bond positions daily, I found a man who talks about his work as if he were describing a pleasant 
vacation. 
Although our meeting took place during trading hours, Ge lber did not seem to be overly concerned

Chunk 3954 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
with the bond market. In fact, he seemed quite relaxed, despite leaving th e trading desk for his 
private office to conduct our interview. "I'll pr obably do better by staying here," he remarked, 
obviously reflecting what he perceived to be a low-opportunity market at the time. 
In response to a query regard ing other traders I wa s interviewing, I mentioned that one, Tony 
Saliba, had made the cover of the current issue of Success magazine. Gelber asked me if I had a

Chunk 3955 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
copy. I pulled out the magazine from my attache cas e and handed it to him. He smiled as he read 
the bold headline describing Saliba's experience  during the week of the October 19,1987, stock 
market crash: "Victory! He Made $4 Million in  Seventy-Two Hours." J okingly, Gelber asked, "I 
made $4 million in twenty minutes on that day; ho w come I'm not on a magazine cover?" It was not 
meant to be boastful. It did, however, very specifi cally summarize a basic tr uth about great traders:

Chunk 3956 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Many, if not most, maintain relatively low prof iles and are therefore vi rtually unknown to the 
public. 
How did you get started in this industry? 
After graduating from college in 1976,1 backpack ed around the country. In Salt Lake City, I 
answered an ad for a commodity broker position. I didn't have any idea what it was, but I figured it 
was something like a stockbroker. I got my licen se while working for a guy who was basically 
running a boiler room operation.

Chunk 3957 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
running a boiler room operation. 
You really started out on the wrong side of the business. 
When I walked in, there was a guy seated at the b ack end of a penny stock office. He spent his days 
on the phone trying to convince people to give  him $5,000 or $10,000 to speculate onhis charting 
system. It was a real fly-by-night operation. 
I was keeping his charts for him, while getting registered. I kept saying to myself, "This guy is

Chunk 3958 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
pretty much of a crook." I got my license and qui t. Then I bummed around for another few months, 
just working temporary jobs to pay the rent. 
What kind of jobs? 
Unloading railroad cars. Then one day I walked into a Thomson McKin-non office and said, "Hey, 
I have a broker's license." The fellow there said  he would pay me $800 a month. That was a large 
amount of money for me at the ti me. All I had to do was go in and cold call; any accounts I opened 
would be mine.

Chunk 3959 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
would be mine. 
But you knew virtually nothing at all about markets at that time. 
I had read a couple of books, and I knew somethi ng about charts—having kept them for the first 
fellow I worked for. 
What books did you read? There weren't too many around at that time. 
The book I learned the most from was Technical Analysis of Stock Trends by Robert D. Edwards 
and John Magee (John Magee, Inc., 109 State Street, Boston, MA).  169What other books would you recommend to people?

Chunk 3960 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The first book we have our tr aders read is Edwin Lefevre' s account of Jesse Livermore, 
Reminiscences of a Stock Operator [Reprinted in 1985 from the original 1923 edition by Trader 
Press, Inc., Greenville, SC.] I've  read it at least a dozen times. 
Anyway, around the time that I started at T homson McKinnon, the Ginnie Mae market was just 
coming into its own. Thomson McKinnon had just hire d a trading group to r un a Ginnie Mae desk.

Chunk 3961 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I told them I was interested in learni ng more about the Ginnie Mae market. 
Why were you attracted to that market? 
It was a new market and seemed more manageab le than the conventional commodities. I figured 
my business would grow more steadily if I focuse d on that market. Also, I had made a number of 
trades in Ginnie Maes. The first trade was a winner, but the following ones were all losers.

Chunk 3962 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
It was magnetic; I felt I could make money there, but  I kept losing, and that made me want to learn 
more about it. 
It sounds like you had a minor compulsion to pursue it. 
Yes, because I had failed. Anyway, the traders at the Ginnie Mae desk taught me a few things, and 
I went out and opened almost every mo rtgage banker account in Salt Lake. 
Did you understand the Ginnie Mae market at that time? 
When I first started opening accounts, I didn't understand anything about it.

Chunk 3963 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How then did you sell people on yourself? 
I snowballed them at first, but I listened and I le arned from the questions they asked me. Initially, I 
was confused by what they were do ing, and they were equally confus ed by what I was trying to sell 
them. 
At least you understood futures as an instrument. 
Right. And with that limited knowledge, I bumbled th rough my first few meetings. Then I really 
got pretty good at it. 
Were these hedging accounts?

Chunk 3964 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Were these hedging accounts? 
Yes, all pure hedging accounts. By May 1977,1 wa s making $2,000 a month in commissions. That 
was a tremendous amount of money for me. 
Was this all in the Ginnie Mae market? 
At that point, yes. Previously, I had done some brokerage in other commodity markets such as 
wheat, hogs, and pork bellies. 
Who were those trades for? 
Just accounts I had opened by cold calling—people w ho really didn't understa nd that they could

Chunk 3965 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
lose, and when they lost, they were always upset. 
Were you giving them trading suggestions? 
Pretty much. 
Using chart analysis? 
Believe it or not, more off the research of Thomson McKinnon analysts, and secondarily off my 
charts. Newer brokers definitely tend to rely on their firm's research. 
Did your customers lose because the research was wrong? 
No. They lost because their time horizon was mos tly day to day, while the research was longer 
term. 
So there was a mismatch?

Chunk 3966 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
term. 
So there was a mismatch? 
Exactly. I think that is a basic problem between mo st brokers and their customers. It is almost 
impossible to get market information to your customer quickly enough for the customer to act on it. 
What you are saying is that ev en if a broker can actually beat  the market trading short term, 
he can't translate that to the customer. 
Insurmountable odds, because you have two people who have to pull the trigger, and the  170information changes so quickly.

Chunk 3967 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
So, one of the points of advice you would give to speculators is to trade with a longer-term 
perspective? 
Yes, you have to. , , 
Let's talk about floor trading. I know, at one point, you were both a floor broker and trader 
in the T-bond futures market. The question I think a lot of people  would ask is: If you receive 
a large customer sell order at the same time you're thinking of closing out your own long 
position, how do you handle it?

Chunk 3968 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
position, how do you handle it? 
I never scalped, so the idea of being long and having a large customer order move the market 
against me 2 or 3 ticks never made any difference. Besides, I had so many cu stomers that they were 
often going opposite ways. 
OK, that's an easy one. But what if some important news was breaking, and all your 
customer orders were going one way against yo ur own position? Did you ever end up trapped

Chunk 3969 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
in a position because you had to execute all the customer orders first? 
Yes, that happened to me about half a dozen times , and it probably cost me a grand total of a half 
million dollars over a number of years. But meas ured against the amount of money I was making, it 
didn't kill me. 
That was the cost of doing business? 
Right. 
It must be a gut-wrenching situation though, know ing you want to get out, but not being able 
to act because of a conflict with customer orders.

Chunk 3970 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Usually, you are too busy acting as  a broker and thinking, "OK, I ha ve to sell 1,000 lots; how can I 
do it best?" Then, when you are done with the order, you might say to  yourself, "Oh damn, I'm still 
long; I have to get out of this thing." 
Is there a built-in disadvantage for a floor trader who also handles customer orders? 
Absolutely. As I tell the people I hire, "If you are a broker, you are not a trad er; if you are a trader, 
you are not a broker." 
But you were.

Chunk 3971 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
you are not a broker." 
But you were. 
It was a wild time. I was the biggest trader and the biggest broker in the same market. I worked 
very long hours and was to tally exhausted when I went home. Then  I would just get up the next day 
and do it again. This went on for th ree years, and while it was a great  experience, I really shouldn't 
have done it. You can't be a great broker and a great trader. I did a good job, but it probably took 
years off my life.

Chunk 3972 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
years off my life. 
Are most of the significant size  traders on the floor just trad ers, or do some also handle 
customers? 
They all are either brokers or traders now. That is the only way to go; there is no doubt about it. 
Is that true of most floors , or just the T-bond floor? 
Primarily, the T-bond floor. In the S&P and in the New York markets, some of the big brokers are 
also big traders. 
Given today's increased scrutiny, are people who violate the confidence of dual trading

Chunk 3973 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
[handling customer orders and trading on e's own account] likely to get caught? 
It is still very difficult to create a flaw less audit trail in an open outcry market. 
Say bonds are trading at 95.00 and the market gets hit with some bearish news. The broker 
executes a large amount of orders for customers and his own account, and the market goes 
straight from 95.00 to 94.00. His Tills are 94.31, 94.30, 94.29 and all his customers get fills at

Chunk 3974 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
94.27 or lower. [Bond prices trade in 32nds.] Ho w does he explain his way out of that one? 
He could give his order or his cust omers' orders to another broker. Or he could fill both orders and 
put another broker's number on his own order. There are always ways  to get around extra scrutiny. 
The smart crooks will always be difficult to catch.  171Is the temptation in dual trading too great? 
No. After having been through it, I would say that  dual trading is good for efficiency in the

Chunk 3975 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
marketplace, but it is too hea vy a burden for the individual. 
Should the rules be changed to disallow dual trading? 
That is a difficult question. What is more important, the efficiency of the mark et or the integrity of 
the individual? There is no doubt in  my mind that dual trading a dds tremendous liquidity to the 
system, and that is probably more important than the fact that a small percentage of dual traders

Chunk 3976 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
may cheat. Besides, even if dual trading were ba nned, the stealers would still find a way to steal. 
That is their percepti on of how to make money in this business. 
When did you first get involved in the T-bond market? 
hi September 1977,1 moved to Chicago and b ecame a broker on the T-bond floor. I was just 
twenty-five and I got lucky. I went to New York  in November 1977 and met with eight big-name 
companies, seven of whom opened accounts. I was at the right place at the right time.

Chunk 3977 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
When did you start trading for your own account on the floor? 
In 1979. 
Were you tempted to give up your floor brokerage  so that you could concentrate on trading? 
Actually, it was just the opposite . I had started out as  a customer's man, and from 1979 through 
1981,1 built a massive customer base. We were a powerful force in the market at that time. 
Probably the saddest thing I ever did was to b ecame a trader too. I was a great broker in my

Chunk 3978 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
twenties, and if I had parlayed that for ten years, I probably w ould have ended up where I am now 
without enduring all the pains of trading. I cons ider trading to be an  unrewarding, unglamorous 
game. 
It's odd you say that, because you have b een far more successful than most traders. 
I guess my point is that as a broker I was at an even higher echelon. I was re ally good at it, and it 
suited my personality. 
So, why did you get into trading?

Chunk 3979 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
So, why did you get into trading? 
I started trading because some of my customers said, "You know the market so well, why don't you 
just trade?" I resisted at first, but after six months of holding out, I started trading. From there it just 
evolved. 
Do you remember your first trades? 
My first trade was a long positi on, and I made some money. Then I put on a long bond/short Ginnie 
Mae spread, which was almost like being long. The market went down, and I lost all the money I

Chunk 3980 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
had made, plus $50,000 more. Since I was ma king about $50,000 per month as a broker, my 
attitude was that I basically broke even that mont h. But I didn't like the feeli ng at all. So, I cut my 
position size down and started trading a little more actively. This happened during the bear market 
of 1979. The problem was that I was bullish all the way down. 
Why were you bullish? 
My customers kept telling me that rates couldn' t go much higher.* For example, I was handling the

Chunk 3981 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
orders for CitiBank and Citicorp and they we re buying all the way down. These were renowned 
people saying that they had an opi nion and backing it up with deeds. 
*Bond prices fall when interest rate s rise. This is a basic concept th at is sometimes confusing to the 
novice. The reason that bond prices decline if rates incr ease can be explained as follows: If rates 
rise, itmeans that all existinglower-yieldinginstrumen ts are less attractive to investors. To induce an

Chunk 3982 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
investor to purchase these lower-coupon bonds, their pr ices must fall sufficientl y so that the return 
is equivalent to the return on the higher-coupon bond purchased at face value. 
What would you do today in the same situation? 
Now, I know the characteristics of various ins titutions. Let's take Citi-Bank. Back then, I was 
buying because they were buying. Now, if Citi-Bank was buying, I might conclude that they were

Chunk 3983 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
just reallocating their assets or changing the durati on of their portfolio. Toda y, I have little regard 
for the views of portfolio managers, because th eir outlook tends to cover a much longer time  172perspective than mine. I didn' t understand that back then. 
So, you don't pay much attention to those types of opinions anymore? 
I listen to them in passing. I don't read the Barren's interviews of portfolio managers anymore. It

Chunk 3984 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
never did much for me, and I don't think it does much for any trader. 
In other words, the problem wasn't the fact th at you were listening to other people, but that 
you were listening to the wrong people. 
I didn't know how to decide which were the righ t or wrong people. I was a naive kid saying, "Here 
is a major account that is buying a lot of stuff; the market should go up." 
You really had no strategy, no plan, no syst em. You were just shooting from the hip.

Chunk 3985 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
That's right. Then over time, I started to get a gr ip on how to make money. As opposed to saying, "I 
have an opinion and I want to express it in the market," I started askin g, "How do I make money 
out of all this?" 
What had you learned by that point? 
I had learned that an  opinion isn't worth that mu ch. It is more important to listen to the market. I 
became a reactive trader as opposed to an opinionated trader.

In 1980, one of my customers was Solomon Brothers. At the time, they were bearish on bonds from 
65 to 80. If I had listened to my big customers as I had done in 1979,1 would have thrown away 
money all over again. 
What told you not to liste n to your customers then? 
The 1979 experience of losing money based on so meone else's opinion—a sound opinion by 
intelligent people that was just absolutely wrong. 
Where were your successes coming from?

Chunk 3987 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Where were your successes coming from? 
I learned how to read the tape and developed go od instincts. We were such big players in bonds 
back then—we, meaning my customers and myse lf—that the spots we pi cked to trade could 
virtually stop the market. We we re actually creating some of the support and resistance points. It 
didn't take that much to do it back then. I think th ere was a streak of months when I hardly had any 
losing days.

Chunk 3988 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
losing days. 
Could you have done it without the commercial accounts? 
I would hope that I could have done it without them ; that it wasn't a self-fulfilling prophecy. But if 
it was, fine. I don't know. 
When did that streak end? 
From a trading standpoint, I ne ver had a losing y ear until 1986, although I did struggle in 1985 
during the mid-stages of the bull market in bonds. 
Was your trading success a matter of being able to read the tape? 
Yes. I was attentive and had good instincts.

Chunk 3989 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yes. I was attentive and had good instincts. 
It sounds like you are saying that either you are born to be a good trader or you are not. 
Well, to a certain extent, that may be true. My fe eling is that you don't have  to be, but it helps. 
Is it a matter of having a si xth sense about the market? 
Yes. Your gut often tells you what to do. 
Are people who don't have the natural instincts for trading wasting their time? Or can almost 
anybody be successful if he or she works at it hard enough?

Chunk 3990 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Working hard has nothing to do with it. About two weeks ago, a very bright fellow who works 
forme said, "This is a very frustr ating business. It doesn't matter how hard I work; it has no bearing 
on whether I make money or not." You have to know yourself and put that knowledge to work in 
the market. 
That sounds like a cliche. What do you mean by "know yourself"? 
I'll give you an example. I think I'm a good trader, but  there is a guy working fo r me who is better. I

Chunk 3991 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
could go out there and beat my head against the desk  and try to outdo him, or I can just be myself.  173Let him make whatever he can, and I'll make whatever I can. 
This is my view of a year in the life of a trader : Four out of twelve mont hs you are hot. You are so 
excited that you can't sleep at night . You can't wait to get to work the next day;  you're just rolling. 
Two months out of the year, you are cold. You are so cold, you are miserable. You can't sleep at

Chunk 3992 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
night. You can't figure out where the next trade is going to come from. The other six months out of 
the year, you make and lose, make and lose. You can't sleep, because you are trying to figure out 
how you are going to make money. 
The net result is that you never sleep, because you ar e constantly thinking too much about trading. 
It is an all-consuming thing. Th at is why you need to  know yourself—to moderate your emotions.

Chunk 3993 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
If you don't, then after a big succe ss, you are high as a kite. You ar e not prepared when just around 
the corner, the market suddenly brings you back to earth. Or, in the opposite situation, when you 
are consistently losing, you might end up jumpi ng out of a window. Why did I leave the floor? 
Again, because I know myself. I need to interact  with people and that doesn't happen there. 
Being on the floor sounds like a very intense th ing to be doing day in, day out. Does it

Chunk 3994 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
physically grind you down? 
Absolutely. You can see that in the older fellows . When you are in your tw enties and thirties, you 
can rebound pretty well from the physical and me ntal stress. As you get older, you don't rebound as 
well, and you have to push harder  to maintain your performance. 
It sounds like professional sports. You ge t to a certain age and no matter how good you 
were— 
That's right. It's exactly like that.

Chunk 3995 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
were— 
That's right. It's exactly like that. 
Out of every 100 people who go to the floor to become traders, how many will make at least a 
million dollars within five years? 
Maybe five or less. 
How many will end up losing everything they came in with? 
At least half. 
You have been more successful than most traders. What do you attribute your success to? 
The reason I have been so consistent is that I'm a great listener. I probably talk to about twenty-five

Chunk 3996 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
traders each day. Most traders don't listen to your opinion; they only want to tell you their opinion. 
I am different because I honestly and truly listen to  what they say and how they say it. For example, 
if one of the major locals calls me up three days in a row when the market  has rallied, and he is 
asking me what I think, I know that he has been  selling and is not su re of his position. 
What does that tell you?

Chunk 3997 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
What does that tell you? 
If it is in line with what the othe r traders I talk to are doing, it tells  me the market will probably go 
higher. 
So if you talk to twenty-five people, and twen ty of them are nervous about the market going 
higher because implicitly they a re short, does that tell you that  you should be trading on the 
long side? 
Yes. I know a large number of peopl e in the industry and that is a big plus. I listen to them. I go

Chunk 3998 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
with the people who are hot. Sure, I can form my  own opinion, but that is not what makes me do 
the things I do in the market. Sometimes, Iknow my  opinion is right, and I'll go with it. Sometimes, 
I know somebody else is hot, and I'll go with their opinion. I'm not picky about how I make my 
money. It doesn't matter if  my opinion is right or wrong. All that  matters is whether I make money. 
Doesn't it get confusing when you talk to twenty-five people and fifteen are bullish and ten

Chunk 3999 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
are bearish? 
Sometimes, but I've been doing this since 1976. I've always been able to read people very well, 
even though no one thinks I listen. For example, I ha ve one trader here who is cold as ice right 
now. All I have to do is listen to him. Last night, he told me he wanted to  be short. I knew that I 
was going to be long. 
As long as he is cold?  174Right, and the one time he gets hot, fine. When the guy is cold, he is cold. You can't say to a trader,

Chunk 4000 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
"You're cold, you can't trade." You have to let them run their course. 
Is reading other traders a key component of your personal trading right now? 
Yes, I'm pliable. I know these people, so I understa nd how to read them. I don't want to hear what 
Jack Schwager says, because I don't know him. I only want to talk to people I know very well. 
What other things are important to your trading success?

Chunk 4001 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The realization that when you don't care, you do we ll, and when you try too hard, you don't do well. 
By "trying too hard," do you mean pressing when there is no trade? 
Pressing is one of the reasons I'm sitting in he re with you for so long during trading hours. The 
markets haven't traded well in weeks, and we are proud of ourselves for not having thrown a lot of 
money away. 
So when the opportunities aren't there, you just lay fairly low?

Chunk 4002 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Don't misunderstand me. I'm not that good at that, but I have gotten better as I've gotten older. I've 
learned that lesson over the last couple of years.  After Richard Dennis left the floor, he said: "The 
first year I left the floor was the most painful expe rience for me, and I have pa id the largest tuition I 
ever have." It was the same with me. 
What was the motivation for coming off the floor, since you were so successful there?

Chunk 4003 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I felt that the industry had developed to the point where my brokerage skills were no longer needed. 
All anyone wanted to know was: "Where's the next tick?" "How can I move size?" The price to be 
paid for my particular skills was too low. 
You are talking in terms of customer business? 
Customer business and trading. The market had gotten so voluminous that my style of swing 
trading was worthless. It got to the point where I was just trying to read the next tick instead of the

Chunk 4004 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
next 8 ticks. 
Why couldn't you play the same game? 
The volume was too big; capitalization was too bi g. I couldn't read the market from the floor. 
Because there were too many players? 
Exactly. In the early days of T-bond futures trad ing, the depth was low and you could read when 
people were overextended long or shor t. You couldn't do that anymore. 
Did your performance start de creasing; did you see the handwriting on the wall?

Chunk 4005 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
In 1985,1 made under a million dollars trading for th e first time and I knew something was wrong. I 
had always been a very consistent trader, making more money each year. I looked at my results and 
found that my profits were smaller, meaning 3 a nd 4 ticks, and my losses were greater. My first 
reaction was to become a much more active pi t trader. I found that I was taking on tremendous 
positions and the risk/reward was insane. That was when I became convinced that I had to make a

Chunk 4006 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
change. 
Were you just lucky that you didn't get hit really  hard during that period on any particular 
trade? 
Actually, I did get hit pretty ha rd a couple of times, but I had so me good winners too. The point is 
that as I worked harder and hard er, I found that all I wa s doing was running in place. I don't like to 
work hard at trading, and here I was just  mentally and physically exhausting myself. 
If you had been doing as well as in previous  years, would you have stayed in the pit?

Chunk 4007 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yes. The pit is a very stimulating environment.  Off the floor, you have to  force yourself to be 
motivated each day. That was a very difficult transition. 
Is it harder to trade off the floor? 
Not in the long run. My profitability in 1987 and 1988 has been pretty good. 
You mentioned that your first year off the fl oor was very difficult. Was the main problem

Chunk 4008 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that you were still trying to trade the market as you did on the floor?  175Yes, that was the number one reason. The second reason was that the transition occurred during the 
1986 runaway bull market. I was bound to lose b ecause my style was not based on following 
trends. 
Is that still true? 
No, it has changed. I've gotten better. I can stil l countertrend trade real  well, but I found you can 
also make a lot of money trend following. 
Do you use trading systems?

Chunk 4009 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Do you use trading systems? 
No, we are "discretionary trader s." We only use technical indicators and systems as trading tools. 
One particularly interesting system we have deve loped is based on quirks re lated to volatility. Our 
belief is that volatility offers clues to trend direction. Although we've found through backtesting 
that this system gives you good signals, we do not blindly follow the trades.

Chunk 4010 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
For an automated, computerized system, what would you consider good results in terms of 
average annual return? 
About 40 to 50 percent, with maximu m equity drawdowns under 10 percent. 
But systems will always have larg er maximum drawdowns than that. 
That is why we haven't directly traded money on them. 
Do you think any system can compete with a good trader? 
I haven't seen one yet, although there may be one somewhere.

Chunk 4011 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
There are some traders who have the skills, but who don't succeed. What is  it that keeps them 
from becoming successful? 
Most traders who fail have large egos and can't  admit that they are wrong. Even those who are 
willing to admit that they are wrong early in their career can't admit it later on. Also, some traders 
fail because they are too worried about losing. 
In other words, successful tradin g is a matter of trying to avoid losses, but not being afraid of 
them.

Chunk 4012 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
them. 
That is a good way to put it. I'm not afraid to lose. When you start being afraid to lose, you're 
finished. 
Is the ability to accept losses a char acteristic of a winning trader? 
Yes. Tom Baldwin is a good example. He only trades the market; he doesn't trade size or equity. By 
that I mean, he doesn't say to himself, "I am long 2,000 contracts. Oh my God, that is too many, I 
have to sell some." He never looks at  it that way. He will sell eith er when he thinks  the market has

Chunk 4013 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
gone up too far, or when he th inks that his position is wrong. 
In your trading experience, is  there one particular trade that stands out as the most 
dramatic? 
In 1986, when the long bond was being cornered by the Japanese, there was a big, emotional rally 
on a Monday morning. I had thought the market was t oo high at 90.00, and here it was trading over 
91.00. So I sold 1,100 contracts scale-up above that  level. The market backed down and was

Chunk 4014 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
offered 1,000 lots at 91.00. Just as I was thinking that I had this trade nailed, in less than five 
minutes the market reversed and soared to 92.00. 
I was down $1 million, and the market was only a few ticks away from limit bid. I had never lost so 
much money, so fast, and it was because I di d things differently than I normally do. 
What specifically? 
I usually don't trade that big early in the year. I like to make money gradually at first and then play 
with the money I have made.

Chunk 4015 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
with the money I have made. 
It sounds like part of your money-management philosophy is based on treating each year 
independently. 
Right. Anyway, I sold a li ttle bit more up at the highs, and fr om that point on, I was only concerned 
with covering. I waited patiently, and the market started coming back dow n. I ended up losing only

Chunk 4016 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
$400,000 for the day, not all that bad considering wh ere I was earlier. But that trade had a big  176emotional impact on me. I was flabbergasted by th e market action. I had forgotten that markets 
could run away like that. I couldn't believe how wrong I had been. 
What did you mean earlier when you said the Japanese cornered the market? 
When the Japanese want to buy something, their big thing is market share. This was the first time

Chunk 4017 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the U.S. got a good feel of how the Japa nese buy securities—they buy them all. 
Was this the move that drove us to the highs in the bond market? 
That's right. 
So, apparently, the Japanese weren't as fazed by th e yield being so low for all the risk implied 
in a long bond position. 
I don't think they look at it in terms of yield. Rather , they view things as whether prices are going 
up, and if they are, they buy. Every time they would buy, prices would go  up, and they would buy

Chunk 4018 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
some more. 
The bond market has collapsed again since then; did they get out of their position in time? 
Sure. Do you know who bought the most at the highs ? The U.S. dealers who desperately needed to 
cover because they had sold on the way up. 
Are the Japanese smart traders then? 
No, they just have a style. They are cannonball tr aders. They go one way, and they all go together. 
A friend of mine at one of the Japanese shops told me about a Japanese trader who bought just

Chunk 4019 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
about every long bond on the screen . About fifteen minutes later he  called back and asked, "Why is 
the basis [the price spread between cash T-bonds and T-bond future s] going out?" Naively, the 
Japanese trader had noticed that cash prices ha d gone way up, while futures didn't go up very much. 
My friend told him, "Well, you just bought every bond available. Of course, the basis is going to go 
out." They didn't really understa nd the impact of their trading.

Chunk 4020 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The Japanese did much the same thing in the U.S.  equity market in 1987 as they did in bonds in 
1986. They practically took cont rol of it, buying because prices kept going higher. 
Г11 never forgive myself for not buying stocks and selling bonds in 1987. That was going to be my 
number one trade in 1987. 
Was the reasoning that the bond market had al ready run way up, while stocks hadn't? Did 
you just believe the two market s were out of line valuewise?

Chunk 4021 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
That's right. Also, we knew the Japanese were  buying the high-capitalizati on U.S. stocks. Having 
already learned their buying st yle in the bond market, the trade was even more obvious. 
Then why didn't you do it? 
The spread between the S&P and the T-bond contract was trading between $19,000 and $25,000 on 
a one-to-one contract value basis.  I went on a four-day vacation, a nd in just a few days, Japanese 
buying in the stock market had pushed the spread to $30,000.

Chunk 4022 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Why didn't you buy the spread before th e vacation, since you had the idea? 
I was waiting for the spread to break out above its trading range. I wanted to buy it above $26,000. 
At a $30,000 spread, I just c ouldn'tpull the trigger. 
What is the key trading rule you live by? 
Never add to a loser. 
What does the average trader do wrong? 
He overtrades and begs for tips. 
How do you handle a losing streak?

Chunk 4023 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How do you handle a losing streak? 
I instinctively trade smaller and sometimes I just take a break. It is a good habit to wipe the slate 
clean and start fresh. 
When you are going bad, but still have some good  positions on, do you liquidate them as well? 
Absolutely. They are bound to turn against you too. 
I found the subjects of dual trad ing and the Japanese impact on the U.S. T-bond market among the

Chunk 4024 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
most interesting portions of my  conversation with Brian Gelber. These subjects, ho wever, did not  177provide any insights into the art of trading. On a more practical note, one of the primary caveats 
provided by Gelber concerned the misuse of brokera ge research. He noted a tendency for the broker 
and client to use longer-term research for short- term trading. This misapplication of information 
often leads to trading losses, ev en when the research is right.

Chunk 4025 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Clearly, flexibility and suppression  of ego are key elements of Ge lber's success. Referring to hot 
traders, he notes, "I'll go with th eir opinion.... It doesn't matter if  I'm right. All that matters is 
whether I make money." 
Finally, Gelber's reaction to losing streaks is on e cited by a number of trad ers. He advises wiping 
the slate clean and starting fresh. Getting out of ev erything allows the trad er to achieve greater

Chunk 4026 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
clarity. Liquidated positions, if th ey still appear attractive, can al ways be reentered once the trader 
has regained his confidence. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  178Tom Baldwin-The Fearless Pit Trader 
The trading pit of an active futures market is an imposing place. Scores of traders push over each 
other, while shouting buy and sell orders at the top of their lungs . To the uninit iated, it seems

Chunk 4027 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
miraculous that this institutionalized bedlam act ually functions efficiently as a process for ex-
ecuting orders. In the frenzied world of futures pits, the T-bond ring, with over 500 traders, stands 
out as the unchallenged giant. The pit is so large that one side of  the ring often does not know what 
is happening on the other side. 
By most accounts, Tom Baldwin is th e single largest individual trad er in the T-bond pit. His trading

Chunk 4028 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
size puts him in the same league as the primary in stitutional players.  Single trades as  large as 2,000 
contracts ($200 million face value T- bonds) are not unusual for him. On  a typical day, he may trade 
over 20,000 contracts (the equivalent  of $2 billion in face value T- bonds). Baldwin is in his early 
thirties, having begun trading T-bonds a scant six years ago. 
Baldwin's entry into the world of fl oor trading sounds more like a reci pe for failure th an success. In

Chunk 4029 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
1982, with no prior trading experience, Baldwin le ft his job as a product manager for a meat-
packing firm to lease a seat on the Chicago Boar d of Trade. His stake was only $25,000. Out of this 
skimpy capital base, he had to pay over $2,000 per m onth to lease the seat, and at least another 
$1,000 per month for living expenses. As  if this were not enough, his wi fe was pregnant at the time.

Chunk 4030 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Obviously, Baldwin is not one to play it safe. His aggressive risk-taking posture is one of the key 
elements of his success. He turned a profit from the beginning. He was a millionaire before his first 
year was up and has never looked back. Although he d eclines to discuss the extent of his winnings, 
$30 million appears to be a conservative estimate. The true figure could be significantly higher.

Chunk 4031 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I considered an interview with Baldwin essential to this project, because of his prominence as the 
most successful floor trader in the world's larg est futures market. Baldwin, however, was not eager 
to be interviewed. Although he had done some in terviews in the past, he had obviously grown 
reluctant to do any more. Without Brian Gelber's  generous intervention—t he two are friends and 
admire each other's trading abilities—this interview would never have taken place.

Chunk 4032 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Gelber had warned me that Baldwin could be either abrasive or gracious, but to be prepared for the 
former. As an example, Gelber said that Bald win would probably answer the question of how he 
first got involved in trading with the curt respon se: "I went down to the floor and began trading." 
As it turned out, this was very cl ose to the spirit of his answer. 
I arrived at Baldwin's office several minutes afte r the end of the day's tr ading. Baldwin arrived a

Chunk 4033 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
few minutes later. Since he had just moved to new offices and the furniture had not yet been 
delivered, the interview was conducted sitting on a window sill. 
Baldwin's attitude was neither abrasive nor gracious; aloof might be the best way to describe it. I 
had the distinct impression that the minute I hes itated in asking the next question, Baldwin would 
be gone. It was St. Patrick's Day, and this impre ssion was intensified each time someone left the

Chunk 4034 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
office saying that he or she woul d meet Baldwin at a local bar. I could sense that Tom was anxious 
to join them. I decided to conduct the interview completely impromptu, s hooting off a new question 
the second he finished answering the prior one. Often his responses were quite short. I felt like a 
photographer stalking a rare bird; one fals e step and the bird would fly off. 
I knew that, at some point, I would not be able to think of an immediate follow-up question. This

Chunk 4035 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
happened about forty minutes into the intervie w. I quickly glanced down at my index cards, 
searching for a lead. Unfortunate ly, my eyes focused on a questio n I had already touched upon, and 
though I tried to ask it from a different perspectiv e, it was too late. The game was over. Baldwin 
said he had to get going and excused himself. 
How did you first get interested in trading? 
I had taken some classes in commodities in graduate  school. I wanted to trad e, but I didn't have the

Chunk 4036 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
money to buy a seat. In 1982, 1 found out I coul d lease a seat, and that's when I began. 
Did you always want to trade as a local as opposed to any other type of trading? 
Yes. 
How did you learn to trade? 
One lot at a time. I always had an opinion. All day long I stood there and deve loped an opinion. As  179I came to see that my opinion was right, I was rein forced, even if I didn't make the trade. Then

Chunk 4037 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
when I traded, I knew from standing there six hours a day, every day, that most of the time I was 
right. I would see the same scenar ios develop over and over again. 
Are you talking about market pattern s or traders doing certain things? 
Both. Market patterns would occu r over and over again, or market  players would do the same thing 
over and over again, and you just trade it. 
What were your first few months like?  Were you profitable initial-

Chunk 4038 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I think the most I was ever down was 19 ticks,  so I pretty much started out profitably. 
Coming to the pits with no background, what wa s it that gave you enough of an edge to be 
right on the market? 
I worked hard. I stood there six hou rs a day, all day, every day.  
But you didn't have any experience to fall back on. 
You don't need it. You don't need any education at all to do it. The smarter you are, the dumber you 
are. The more you know, the worse it is for you.

Chunk 4039 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
are. The more you know, the worse it is for you. 
For your type of trading—that is, scalping—whe n you put on a trade, what are you looking 
for? 
To get as much as I can get out of it. I've taken full points or just 1 tick out of a trade. You just 
never know. You have to watch the market, get a feel  for it, and if you are in the right position, just 
go with it. 
On average, though, your trades will net out at a few ticks? 
Yes. I probably average 4-ti ck profits on big positions.

Chunk 4040 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I assume your holding time is probably very, very short.  
I try to make it short.  
Are we talking about minutes? 
Yes, or seconds. Just because that is less risk. The object is always: Minimize your risk. 
Have you always been a scalp-type trader? 
Well, I evolved from a pure scalper to a combination of scalper and speculator. 
Right now, what percentage of your trades are position versus scalp? 
A small percentage, well below 10 percent.

Chunk 4041 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
A small percentage, well below 10 percent. 
Basically then, you are still using the same  basic trading style yon started out with. 
Right. 
Do you use any technical input? 
Yes. I use charts. 
Do you use intraday charts, since you are trading short term? 
No. Bar charts covering the past six months. 
If y o u  lo o k  a t th e ch a rts a n d  sa y ,  " I'm b a si cally bullish," do you primarily scalp from the 
long side?

Chunk 4042 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
long side? 
Not necessarily. I would start with an opinion, but if I saw something to change my mind, I would 
adjust. 
Is the fact that you started off with a chart-influenced tradin g bias a key element behind your 
winning? 
Yes. 
Were there periods when you were unsucce ssful, or did you remain consistent? 
Consistent. 
Didn't you have any losing months? 
Yes, I had one or two.  180But not two together? 
No, never.

Chunk 4043 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
No, never. 
What percentage of those who come to trade on  the floor are still around after five years, 
versus losing their stake and dropping out? 
Less than 20 percent. That is really the ra le of thumb, and it's probably less than that. 
What percentage are successful to the point of  making and keeping at Least a couple of 
million? 
One percent. 
In other words, a very sm all fraction of traders.

Chunk 4044 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Right. It is like any other indus try. How many people get to be president of General Motors? 
Do you have an opinion about what separa tes the 1 percent from  the other 99 percent? 
Yes. It is a lot of hard work, fo r one. It's perseverance. You have to love to do it. Also, in our 
business, you have to have a total disr egard for money. You can't trade for money. 
Do you mean as long as you like the position, you stay with it? That you can't think, "I'm

Chunk 4045 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
losing $1 million on this trade,  and with $1 million I could h ave bought a great house." You 
can't translate it into real terms. 
Exactly. Most people do. 
I guess another way of saying it is you have to have almost no fear. 
Right. 
Is that a characteristic of winning traders : They have less fear than the losers? 
Yes. 
Can you size up a new trader on the floor and te ll if he is going to make it or not? 
Yes. 
What kind of things would tip you off that he is a loser?

Chunk 4046 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Most important, losers don't work hard enough. Mo st people walk in and think there is a 50/50 
chance on any trade. They don' t think there is anything more to it than that. They don't concentrate. 
They don't watch the factors that affect the market. Y ou can see it in their eyes ; it is almost as if 
there is a wall in fr ont of their face. 
By factors, do you mean fundamentals? 
No. Paying attention to what other markets are doing, such as the Dow Jones or gold. Watching the

Chunk 4047 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
traders in the pit. 
Patterns? 
Yes. 
In other words, they are not paying enough atte ntion. They are standing there trying to pick 
a trade here and there, but they are not absorbing everything that is going on. 
Right. Also, their expenses are usually way too high. They can't stand there and hack it long 
enough to pick it up. Because it is like any job, if you stand there long enough, you have to pick it 
up. It is just a matter of how long you can  afford to stand there before you do.

Chunk 4048 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Do you really believe that? 
Well, the average guy might not be a million-dollar trad er, but if he stands there for five years, he 
would have to pick it up. It is just like a job. Yo u don't start any job and feel comfortable in the first 
six months. 
You did. 
Yes, but I did start as a one -lot trader. And I wasn't r eally comfortable, because I had to make 
money. I only had $25,000 to my name. 
At what point were you confident that you were going to be successful at it?

Chunk 4049 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
That is an interesting question. You are never r eally confident in this business, because you can  181always be wiped out pretty quickly. The way I tr ade is: Live by the sword, die by the sword. There 
is always the potential that I could get caught with  a big position in a fluke move with the market 
going the limit against me. On the other hand, there is  no doubt in my mind that I could walk into 
any market in the world and make money. 
What percentage of your days are losers?

Chunk 4050 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
What percentage of your days are losers? 
One day out often. 
Has that percentage changed over time? 
That is over a long period of time. 
From your perspective, what does the aver age trader—that is, public trader—do wrong? 
They trade too much. They don't pick their spot s selectively enough. When they see the market 
moving, they want to be in on th e action. So, they end up forci ng the trade rather than waiting 
patiently. Patience is an important trait many people don't have.

Chunk 4051 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Waiting for the right spot? 
Right, I bet most peopl e are probably ahead after th eir first five trades. They  think, "This is great, 
like free money." But then they forget that the reason they made money on their early trades was 
because they waited a long time. They  said, "I bet this is a good spot to buy it because I've seen the 
market act this way a lot of times." And they made money. But all of a sudden, they are doing a 
trade every day.

Chunk 4052 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trade every day. 
The next thing that happens is they lose on a fe w trades, and invariably don't know how to take a 
loss. They made money to start, and before they know it, they are even. No w they hesitate. "Where 
do I get out?" The minute they hesitate, the mark et just keeps going. Now they are losing money 
and they say, "If I sell it here, I'm going to  lose $1,000." They don't like to lose $1,000, when

Chunk 4053 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
they're getting paid $500 a week. Now, all of  a sudden, they are thinking about the money. 
Once you think about th e money, you are dead? 
Yes. That is what usuall y happens to the public.  
What is your own way of hand ling losses? Get out. Quickly? 
If I can. My point is that I have a lot of patien ce and I wait. If I know it is a losing trade, I wait for 
what I think is the optimum time to bail out. Then I try and reverse.

Chunk 4054 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
So, if you realize you don't like  the trade anymore, you'll get ou t, but you'll pick your time? 
Right, but I will get out. 
Let's say you are doing that on a day when the market is a one-way stree t. At what point do 
you just have to cough it up? 
It depends how far it has gone against you. If it's against you a long way, at some point you just 
throw it in. Those days happen maybe three or f our times a year. You just start bailing out.

Chunk 4055 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
But you usually have a feel for when that is the thing to do? 
Yes, because it has happened before. 
But normally, if you are just a bit behind in a trade, you are better off if you let the market 
move a little in your direction and try to sell on strength, or buy  on weakness, instead of just 
trying to dump it in a hurry? 
Right. 
Is that a key element to your trading style? 
Yes. Never give up on a trade. Many traders who are in a losing trade will ju st get out because they

Chunk 4056 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
were taught that you have to have discipline. Great. Those traders will always be around. But if 
they just had some patience and said, "Yes, it is go ing to be a losing trade, but instead of getting out 
here at 7, maybe if I wait and just sweat it  out for another minute, I can sell at 10." 
Is it a matter of just wanting to get out to stop  the pain? And if they were willing to stand the 
pain a little longer, they wo uld be better off. Is that a fair way of putting it?

Chunk 4057 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yes. They give up too quickly. In most cases, if you don't give up, you might be able to turn a five-
yard loss into a two-yard loss.  182Your trading size has obviously grown quite dramatically since you  first got into the business. 
Has that made it harder to trade? 
Yes, you have to adapt. You need to change you r method of buying and selling, because the market 
is continually changing in subtle ways. 
What changes have you seen in the bond market since you got in?

Chunk 4058 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Well, you can trade bigger size. Now you can usually trade a couple of hundred at e ach tick. It 
doesn't move the market as much. 
How about a thousand lots? 
It depends on the liquidity at the time. Lots of  times you can get out. It is amazing how much 
liquidity there is when you want to get out. 
On average, if you had to dump a thousand,  how much would that move the market? 
Depending on the time of day and th e liquidity, maybe 1 or 2 ticks. 
Not much at all? 
No, not much.

Chunk 4059 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Not much at all? 
No, not much. 
Has size been an impediment at all if the liquidity is that good? 
Yes, it is harder. Generally, when you get into a big position, the rest of the floor knows about it 
because they stood there and watched you. At least they think they know. They all put their hands 
down and wait when they think you are wrong. It is  natural for a trader to be skeptical. 
I would almost think that because you have a long-term record of success, they would more

Chunk 4060 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
often coattail you. 
Lots of times that is true, and that also make s it harder to get in and out. When you go to offer 
them, they are all offering too. 
How do you handle those situations? 
You have to pick your spot. You have to wait for th e big paper order to come in and then go for it. 
Does it become like a chess game, where you so metimes want the pit th inking that you are 
selling when you are really buying?

Chunk 4061 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
selling when you are really buying? 
Yes, sometimes. But generally, you can't trade big size when you are doing that. 
So, frequently, if you are long and want to liquidate, you just wait for the bid to come in? 
Right. 
What kinds of things do you look for in a chart? 
Key points such as the high and low for the week , the halfway backpoint, and consolidation areas. 
Do you use charts for short-term or long-term perspective? 
Short term. 
Short term in your case meaning?

Chunk 4062 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Short term. 
Short term in your case meaning? 
I guess as short as possible. You get in a trade, make money as fast as possible, and minimize your 
risk. 
I've noticed that a lot of times, bonds will take  out one- and two-week highs or lows by a few 
ticks and then pull back. The price action almost  seems like a trap for the breakout players. 
Is that a pattern in the bond market? 
Yes. It always has been. 
Do you use fundamentals?

Chunk 4063 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Do you use fundamentals? 
Whenever any important fundamental numbers come out, I use them. 
Do you use the fundamentals indir ectly, that is, by seeing how th e market responds to the new 
information? 
Yes, but also by being the first one to trade off the new fundamental information. I know what I am 
going to do if a number comes out one way or the ot her, and I usually  have the opportunity to be

Chunk 4064 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
first.  183You want to get there before the crowd does. Are you normally right on that type of trade? 
Yes. 
You've done tens of thousands of trades. Does  any single trade stand out as particularly 
emotional? 
The first 100-lot I did. It was a milestone.  
What kind of jump was that for you? 
You tend to go from one lot to five lots to  ten lots to twenty lots to fifty lots. 
So, you probably went from 50 to 100? Do you remember that trade?

Chunk 4065 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yes, it was a much bigger risk. The market was trading at 64.25 and a broker bid 25 for 100 lots. 
But he didn't put a size on it, he just bid 25. So I said, "Sold." He thought I was being funny and 
said, "I'll buy the 100," knowing I had never traded that big before. So I said, "Well, I'll sell you 
100." The market went to 24 offered instantly. 
It almost sounds like you did your first 100-lot as a dare?

Chunk 4066 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Well, almost. But I wasn't a very  good trader then. I immediatel y bought ten, then ten more. I was 
trying to bid at 23, and the market  went to 22 offered. By the time  I got out, I had ten different 
people in the trade, because I didn't know how to cover 100 lots. 
But the trade worked out for you? 
Oh yes. Well, actually, the word got out that this sma ll trader had done a 100-lo t. So I had to go up 
to the office to talk to the clearing firm after the close.

Chunk 4067 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How long had you been trading at that time? 
Six months. 
That was pretty early on. I assume your capi talization was really inadequate to handle 100 
lots? 
Right. I had probably made $100,000 by then. Maybe not even that.  
Even at $100,000, that wouldn't cov er you for much of a move. 
Yes, only 1 point. [In bonds, 1 point equals 32 ticks (the sm allest price movement).] I told them, 
"Look, I just thought it was a great trade at the time, and I'll proba bly never do it again."

Chunk 4068 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How long was it before you  traded 100 lots again? 
Two days. 
You just never thought abou t the risk side of it? 
No, if a guy bids 25 for 100, and I think that it is a great trade, I just say "Sold." 
Is there any element in your mindset as a trader that says: I had better be careful that I'm 
always in the game? 
That came later. 
Are you always in control, or are th ere days when you have lost control? 
There were days when I've lost control.  
Any that stand out?

Chunk 4069 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Any that stand out? 
A couple. You have to say that about any day you lose a couple of million dollars. 
Were those days one-way street markets? 
Yes, one-way streets. Because I'm a market maker,  I take the other side of the trend. So, if the 
market goes one way for 50 ticks, I can guarantee  you I'm going the wrong way, and at some point, 
it is going to be a loss. 
What was your position at the October 1987 low in bonds? 
I was long. 
When did you start getting long?

Chunk 4070 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I was long. 
When did you start getting long? 
Five points higher.  184Five full points! You mean 81? 
Yes. The day it broke below 77,1 was long thousands of  contracts. Other traders were also heavily 
long. 
That was the day we gapped sh arply lower. Who was selling? 
The commercials just kept selling.  
Did you have second thoughts? 
Yes. 
Did you think if the market went down to 76, maybe it could go to 70? 
No. At that point, you had to  say it was all over and done. 
Why?

Chunk 4071 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Why? 
Technical analysis and experience. 
Was that an example of your bein g patient in picking your spot  to get out, even when the 
initial trade was wrong? 
Right. 
Do you ever use any trading systems for anything? 
No. They wouldn't be there if they weren't wrong.  
Do you think trading system s are a losing game? Sure. Why do they exist?  
You tell me. Because people aren't confident in their own ability. If you had a really good trading

Chunk 4072 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
system, you could make millions. Why would you sell it for $29.95? 
Does luck have anything to do with trading? 
Trading is like any other job. You work hard, put in the time and effort, and make your own luck. I 
was lucky that the first 100-lot I sold was a winn er. But why was I lucky? Because I stood there all 
day for over six months, developing and honing ma rket feeling. When the opportunity occurred, I 
didn't hesitate. 
You have to pay your dues to get the luck. 
Right.

Chunk 4073 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Right. 
Are there people on the floor who are not good traders, but are way ahead because they just 
happened to do a couple of big trades on the right side of the market? Can anybody really get 
by just on luck? 
No, not for long. The rule of thumb is if you have lasted a year, you will make it, but it is hard. 
Are there traders that you are influenced by  because you respect what they are doing? 
Oh, yes. They are indicators.

Chunk 4074 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Oh, yes. They are indicators. 
So, that is actually part of your trading appr oach. For example, if trader X is a good trader, 
and he is on a roll, and you are thinking of se lling— And he does, then you know you're right. 
But if he is buying? 
Then you hesitate. Maybe you don't get into the trade. 
Are there traders who can't succeed because thei r ego is too big to ever be influenced? 
Yes. 
Is part of the success a willingness to not always do your own thing?

Chunk 4075 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Right. You have to adapt to your success. If you ma ke a lot of money, all of a sudden you start to 
think you are infallible. You forget the reason you we re right was because of all those little factors 
that you followed. As soon as you think, "I'm the guy who is going to lead the way," you get 
slammed. 
So, it really doesn't make a difference whether it  is your idea or somebody else's. Winning or 
losing is all that counts. Where the idea came from isn't important? 
Right.

Chunk 4076 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Right. 
Do you have to be somewhat of an egomaniac to be a good trader?  185Actually, the best traders have no ego. To be a gr eat trader, you have to have a big enough ego only 
in the sense that you have confid ence in yourself. You cannot let e go get in the way of a trade that 
is a loser; you have to swallow your pride and get out. 
After you get way ahead, is there a temptation to say, the extra money doesn't mean anything 
anymore, maybe I should cash in the chips?

Chunk 4077 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
anymore, maybe I should cash in the chips? 
I never thought that way. Obviously, when I starte d, I needed to make money to support my family, 
but I never had a goal to make a million dollars. I said, "Hey, this is great, maybe I can make 
$100,000." 
You passed that a very long time ago. Do you have any other goals? 
No. 
You just do what you do because you enjoy it? 
Yes. And I hope it lasts. 
 
Baldwin's incredible trading achievements made him an ideal interview candidate for this book.

Chunk 4078 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
However, I did not really expect his comments to  be pertinent to myself or other off-the-floor 
traders. After all, what could a floor trader , whose time horizon is measured in minutes and 
seconds, say that was relevant to trader s who hold positions for weeks or months? 
To my surprise, the interview yielded some rele vant insights. Perhaps the most important point 
made by Baldwin was his emphasis on not viewing tr ading in terms of mone y. To him, money is

Chunk 4079 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
only a means of keeping score. By contrast, most tr aders tend to think of gains and losses in terms 
of their monetary implications—a frame of mi nd that only gets in the way of making trading 
decisions. 
For example, assume you originally planned to  risk up to $5,000 on a trad e, and quickly find 
yourself down by $2,000. If, at this point, you start to  think of the trade in  terms of money (for

Chunk 4080 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
example, "the extra $3,000 can pay for my vacati on"), you might well liquidate the position, even 
though you still believed in the trad e. It is one thing to get out  because you no longer like the 
position, but it is quite another matter to liquidat e on impulse simply because you have translated 
the risk into tangible terms. 
Another interesting point made by Baldwin is an unconventional one: Don' t get out of a losing

Chunk 4081 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trade too hastily; instead, wait and choose your time. This advice seem s to fly in the face of most 
trading advice. After all, isn't one  of the basic tenets of tradin g success to cut your losses quickly? 
However, I don't think Baldwin's statement contradicts the rule. I believe he is  saying that often the 
worst time to bail out of a position is during a vi olent price move agains t you. Baldwin's point is

Chunk 4082 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that by bearing the pain just a little longer, you ma y be able to find a more favorable circumstance 
for liquidating. Of course, this philosophy should be applied only by discipline d traders: those with 
the ability to maintain a risk control strategy. 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  186Tony Saliba-"One-Lot" Triumphs* 
Tony Saliba came to the floor of the Chicago Boar d Options Exchange in 1978. After a half-year of

Chunk 4083 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
clerking, Saliba was ready to tr y it on his own. He found anothe r trader to back him for $50,000, 
and after a favorable start, nearly self-destructe d. He pulled back from the brink of disaster by 
altering his trading techniques, and has been successful ever since. 
Saliba's trading style can be descri bed as trying to do a little better  than treading water day in, day 
out, while being positioned to ta ke advantage of the rare spect acular trading opportunity. His

Chunk 4084 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
fortune has been built largely by exploiting only a handful of such events. Two of these 
situations—the Teledyne price explosion a nd the October 1987 stock market collapse—are 
discussed in the interview. 
The impressive aspect of Saliba's trading achieve ments is not the few spectacular gains he has 
registered in his career. Rather, it is that thes e gains have been achieved by using a trading

Chunk 4085 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
approach exemplified by incredible risk control.  In fact, at one point, Saliba managed to string 
together seventy consecutive months of pr ofits exceeding $100,000. Quite a few traders have 
become multimillionaires by scoring several big h its. A much smaller number have managed to 
hold on to their gains. Only the rare trader can boast both occasional dramatic gains and consistent 
trading profits.

Chunk 4086 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trading profits. 
*Readers unfamiliar with options may wish to first read Appendix 2 in order to understand the 
trading-related reierences in this chapter. 
Although the homework required for Saliba's successf ul trading is extensive, he has nonetheless 
managed to diversify into a wide range of other ventures, including real estate investments, a 
software company, and a restaurant chain. Overal l, his extracurricular business endeavors have

Chunk 4087 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
proven only modestly profitabl e, but they have indulged his appetite for variety. 
During the time these interviews were being conducted, Saliba was involved in the most important 
business venture of his life: negotiating with a French bank to back him with several hundred 
million dollars to form a major trading company. Hi s goal is to discover a nd train a generation of 
successful traders.

Chunk 4088 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
successful traders. 
Saliba is a likable person who make s you feel like you're one of his be st friends within five minutes 
of meeting. He is a person who ge nuinely likes people—and it shows. 
On the evening before our scheduled meeting, Sa liba had a minor accident, slipping on the marble 
floor at the health club in the Chicago Board Options Exchange building. As I showed up at the 
scheduled time, his aide told me that Tony would not be in that morning due to the accident. I left a

Chunk 4089 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
message. Saliba called later that day, and to spar e me the inconvenience of missing my flight that 
evening, or making another trip to Chicago, he  arranged to meet me several hours later. 
We talked at the LaSalle Club bar, which was su fficiently empty to not ca use a major distraction. 
Initially, I was too intensely focu sed on directing the interview to pay any attention at all to the

Chunk 4090 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
largemovie screen at the front of th e bar. Later on, however, as I rela xed, I glanced at the screen as 
Saliba was answering one of my questions. I inst antly recognized the train scene from the movie 
Risky Business in which the sensuous Rebecca DeMornay seduces Tom Cruise. 
I have a bad habit of severely  overscheduling my appointments,  and as Saliba was my third 
interview of the day, I was beginni ng to feel the strain. My first thought was, "Keep your eyes off

Chunk 4091 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the screen, you are having a hard enough time keepi ng your mind focused as it is." My second 
thought was, "It would be incredib ly rude not to pay full attenti on to Tony, especially after he 
literally hobbled over to spare me the inconveni ence of having to resche dule our interview." My 
third thought was, "Thank God I' m the one facing the screen." 
What led you to become a trader? 
I was a caddy for some grain traders when I was in  high school. In college, a friend of mine asked

Chunk 4092 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
me if I would like to be a broker. I thought that he meant doing the same thing as the guys I had 
caddied for. So, I said, "Yes. Great! Where?" "Ind ianapolis," he answered. I said, "What exchange 
is in Indianapolis?" "None," he said, "you do it on the phone." I had this impression of: "Hello New 
York, buy; Chicago, sell." When I got there, I found out I was a salesman. 
After a few months, I asked the guys in the offi ce, "Who makes all the money in this business?"

Chunk 4093 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
They said you have to be on th e floor. Right there I decided to go to the Chicago Board Options  187Exchange. On the floor, I met one of the traders I had caddied for years ago, and he grubstaked me 
with $50,000. 
Isn't that unusual, giving $50,000 to a kid who used to caddy for you? 
It was, except that he was very wealthy and need ed to get off the floor because of his high blood 
pressure. He owned a seat that he had bought for only $10,000, and just  needed the ab ility to trade

Chunk 4094 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
in a customer account. I was going to help him do that. 
What made him think you could make it as a trader? 
He had heard some rumors around the floor that  I was a hotshot clerk, and he basically took a 
chance on me. 
What happened? 
I went from $50,000 to about $75,000 in the fi rst two weeks. I had put on all these volatility 
spreads [an option position that will gain if the market becomes more  volatile] and they were 
getting pumped up. 
Did you think, "Boy, this is easy"?

Chunk 4095 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Did you think, "Boy, this is easy"? 
I thought, "This is it!" I mean, I was a genius. But what I was re ally doing was taking the opposite 
side of positions the other brokers were liquidating, letting them out of the market with their profits, 
while I was left holding the bag. This was spri ng 1979 and implied volatiliti es were very high 
because 1978 was a very volatile year. Well, th e market went nowhere, and the volatility and

Chunk 4096 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
option premiums collapsed. Within six weeks I had lost almost everything. The original $50,000 
was down to only about $15,000.1 was feeling suicid al. Do you remember th e big DC10 crash at 
O'Hare in May 1979, when all those peopl e died? That was when I hit bottom. 
Was that a metaphor for your mood? 
Yes. I would have exchanged places with one of t hose people in that plane on that day. I felt that 
bad. I thought, "This is it; I've mined my life."

Chunk 4097 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Did you feel guilty because you had lost someone else's money? 
Yes, and I felt like a failure.  
Had you started out confident? 
Initially, I was very confident because before I started tradi ng on my own, I had clerked for a 
broker for four months and picked his brain clean. 
And now you thought the game was over? 
Yes. In June 1979,1 decided that I better find another job. I went to the Levy brothers, who owned

Chunk 4098 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
a chain of restaurants that my dad built for them . They said, "Any time you want a job, you can run 
one of our restaurants." So, I said, "Hold that  line. I am going to give it one more month," 
Did you feel better because you had a cushion? 
Yes. I said, "This is great, I've sti ll got fifteen grand in my account."  
You had a stop on your life so to speak? 
Exactly, exactly. I had a stop on my career. So, I decided to go back  and give it one more shot.

Chunk 4099 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Did the fellow who staked you know how much you had lost ? Did he ever say anything? 
Oh, good question, Jack. He called me every night . I' ve grubstaked ma ny guys since then, and 
three or four of them have lost more than fifty grand each. This man was a multimillionaire, and he 
acted as if this was the end of the world. 
Did he ever ask you for the rest of the money back? 
No, he just moaned and groaned. He had become  wealthy through inheritance and money he made

Chunk 4100 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
in another business. He really didn't know much about option trading. He had bought the seat to 
have something to do with his life. He told me , "If you lose $5,000 more, we 'll pull the plug." So, I 
spent the next few weeks winding down my positions. 
During that time, I sought advice from the more  experienced brokers on the floor. They said, "You 
have to be disciplined and you have to do your  homework. If you do those two things, you can

Chunk 4101 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
make money down here. You might not get rich, but you can make $300 a day, and at the end of  188the year that's $75,000. You have to  look at it that way." It was lik e a light bulb went on. I realized 
that this chipping away approach was what I s hould be doing, not putting myself at a big risk, 
trying to collect a ton of dough. 
At the time I was in Teledyne options, which was a very volatile market. So, I switched to Boeing,

Chunk 4102 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
which was a very tight, narrow range type of mark et. I became a spread scalper trying to make a 
quarter or an eighth of  a point on a trade. 
I stuck strictly to my goal of tr ying to average $300 a day and it  was working. This period taught 
me to be regimented and disciplined. 
То this day, I live by the credo of hard work, ho mework, and discipline. I teach my guys that. 
Anyway, at this same time, I stil l had the remnants of a big spread  position in Teledyne that I was

Chunk 4103 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
in the process of liquidating. It wa s a position that would lose in a rising market. One day after I 
had been trading Boeing for about five weeks, Teledyne started moving up sharply. I was not going 
to let it get me again. I rushed into the Teledyne pit to take my position off. I was hearing floor 
brokers come in with orders, and all of a sudde n I found myself responding to them. I was adapting

Chunk 4104 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the same technique I had learned in Boeing to Teledyne, except inst ead of scalping for an eighth or 
a quarter, I was scalping for halves and dollars. 
What size were you trading at the time? 
I was doing one lot at a time. The guys didn't like me because I was getting in their way. They 
wanted to do ten- or  twenty-lot orders. 
In other words, you were just a nuisance. 
Exactly. 
How did you get someone to take one lot?

Chunk 4105 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How did you get someone to take one lot? 
On the options floor, it's first come, first served. If you have 100 to sell and someone bids first for 
just one, you have to do his one before you do 99 with the number two guy. The broker could 
ignore you if he wants, but if he  does, he's breaking the rules. 
Were you ignored? 
The brokers never did, but the market makers on the floor did.  
By brokers, you mean order fillers?

Chunk 4106 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
By brokers, you mean order fillers? 
Yes. The floor brokers are the order fillers, and the market makers are the locals who trade for 
themselves. On the options ex change, the two are separate. 
Were you the only one-lot trader in Teledyne? 
For the most part, yes. 
Did you take a lot of ribbing? 
Oh, did I! They called me "one-lot" for the long est time. The individual w ho gave me the hardest 
time was the best trader in the crowd. He had ma de millions and was virtually a legend in his own

Chunk 4107 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
time. He started leaning on me and ribbing me  right from the beginning. He made my life 
miserable. 
Did your ego get dented by these really successful traders railing you? 
Oh, yes. And, it went on for al most a year, day in, day out.  
W`re you tempted to pick up your trading a little bit? 
I did, but not for that reason. My backer, who had given me such a hard time when I was down, 
was the prod. Although he didn't know that much a bout trading, he did give me one piece of very

Chunk 4108 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
useful advice. Once I started turn ing it around, he told me to increa se my size. He said, "Tony, a 
banker makes his first loan and he is very careful,  but as he gets more co mfortable, he makes his 
loans bigger. You need to  increase your size." 
How did the harassment you were taking on the floor finally end? 
When they introduced puts in June 1980, the lead trader, who had given me the hardest time, hated

Chunk 4109 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
them. He said they were bad for the business and he didn't want to trade them. I seized that 
opportunity to really study what put s would mean to us, and I was one of the first market makers to 
start trading puts.  189Actually, it opens up a whole range of new strategies. 
Oh, unbelievable. These other guys were set in th eir ways, even though they had only been there a 
couple of years. Sooner than you might think, this  nmnber one trader befriended me and suggested

Chunk 4110 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that we work together. We started working on advanced strategies, ge tting real creative and 
abstract. 
Were you working these out on a computer? 
No, we did everything by hand. Wr iting out all these "what-ifs." 
Didn't you still have to be guessing right  on price and volat ility direction? 
You would have to guess right on volatility. However, we didn't have to peg market direction, 
because we were setting up spread s that had a big edge. For example, one option might be highly

Chunk 4111 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
overvalued because it was popular  among the member firms. 
Eventually, I felt I was doing more of the work, while  this top trader in th e pit was counting on his 
ability to muscle the market. He would also stray from the strategies we had worked out and even 
started doing things to try to hurt me. I would say, "What ar e you doing?" He would just answer, "I 
changed my mind." 
Finally, I just said, "Forget it, I'm working on my own." I started taking on more size. When

Chunk 4112 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
interest rates went through the roof in 1981 and early 1982, my strate gies worked really well and I 
started making a lot of money. Then in the bu ll market in 1982,1 had days when I was making 
$200,000 a day. The guys in my clearinghouse couldn't be lieve the sheets; there was just tons of 
paper. 
What kind of trades were you doing? 
I was doing everything. I consider  myself a matrix trader. I trad e everything on the screen as it

Chunk 4113 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
interrelates to everything else. My  basic strategy, however, was buying butterflies [a long or short 
position at one strike price balanced by an opposite position in higher and lower strike options—for 
example, long one IBM 135 call, short two IBM 140 calls, and long one IBM 145 call] and 
offsetting that with an explosion position. 
By buying butterflies, do you me an you were long the middle or  long the wings [that is, the 
higher and lower strike price options]?

Chunk 4114 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
higher and lower strike price options]? 
Long the wings. Your risk is limited, and if the market does not move widely, time decay works in 
your favor. [Barring a favorable price move or an increase in volatility, the value of an option 
erodes steadily over time. In a relatively flat mark et, the premium erosion in options with a strike 
price near the market price—"middle" in butterfl y spread—will be greater than that of options

Chunk 4115 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
further removed from the strike price— "wings" in spread.] Of course, I tried to buy the butterflies 
as cheap as I could. If I chaine d enough of them together, my prof it zone would be fairly wide. 
Then I would do an explosion position in a more distant month. 
What do you mean by the term "explosion position"? 
That's basically my own term. An explosion positi on is an option position th at has limited risk and

Chunk 4116 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
open-ended potential, which will profit from a large price move or an increase in volatility. For 
example, a position consisting of long out-of-t he-money calls and long out-of-the-money puts 
would be an explosion position. 
It sounds like the basic unifying fe ature of the explosion position is that as the market moves, 
the delta [the expected price change in the option position given a one-unit change in the price

Chunk 4117 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
of the underlying market] increases in your f avor. So, you are really betting on volatility. 
Exactly. 
In effect, this is the opposite of what you do with the butterfly. 
Yes. I put on the butterfly in the front month, where time is working for me, and the explosion 
position in the mid- or back-month. Then I compleme nt that with scalping to help pay for the time 
decay in the explosion position. 
In other words, the explosion posi tion is your money bet in case of a big move, while your

Chunk 4118 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
scalping is paying the bills, that is, the time decay cost of the explosion position.  
Exactly.  190Were you always offsetting one position with another? In other words, were you always delta 
neutrafl [An option position in which total equi ty will remain roughly unchanged for small 
price changes in either direction.] 
Usually, but once in a while I woul d take a significant net position.  
What was your first really big trade?

Chunk 4119 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
What was your first really big trade? 
Teledyne in 1984. The stock had dropped sharply a nd I was building up a position in the out-of-the-
money October calls. Well, the stock started inchi ng back up, but these guys  from the Pacific Coast 
Exchange, where they also list Te ledyne, were leaning on my longs. Th ey just kept battering them 
on the close every night. Instead of shying away, I stepped up and would buy them. "You want to

Chunk 4120 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
sell them at ГА, I'm 1'л bid for fifty." This went on for over ten trading days. 
Why were these Pacific Coast traders leaning on the calls? 
The stock had gone down from 160 to 138, and th en inched its way back up to 150.1 guess they 
didn't think it was going to go up anymore. On Ma y 9 at 9:20 they stopped trading in Teledyne 
because of news pending. The news comes across the tape: "Teledyne Announces a Stock 
Repurchase Program at $200 per Share." 
Buying back their own stock?

Chunk 4121 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Buying back their own stock? 
Yes. The stock was at $155, and I owned the $180 calls. Overnight, I made millions. The stock 
eventually went up to $300. The next four to five months were great. 
What happened after that? 
One of my goals in life was to become a millionaire before I was thirty and retire. Well, I was a 
millionaire before I was twenty-five. I had decide d to retire when I was thirty. On May 5, 1985, my

Chunk 4122 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
thirtieth birthday, I walked off the floor and said good-bye to ev erybody and that was it. I was 
never going to come back to the floor. 
How far were you up then? 
About $8-9 million. 
Did you know what you were going to do? 
I didn't really know. I thought I'd stay in th e business somehow, but work off the floor. 
How long did your retirement last? 
About four months.  
Were you bored? 
Yes. I missed the markets. I missed the excitement.

Chunk 4123 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
So, in the beginning, money was the goal, but once you got there it became. 
Yes, it became secondary. Maybe if  I had a wife and kids, or someone special in my life, I might 
not have gone back. But trading wa s my life. It made me feel like something; it gave me a reason 
for being. 
I understand one of your best trading periods wa s the week of the Octo ber 1987 stock crash. 
Tell me about it.

Chunk 4124 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Tell me about it. 
I was expecting a big move, but I didn't know if it would be up or down. So, I started building the 
same type position that I had in Teledyne. 
The butterfly spread combined with the explosion position. 
Yes. 
What was the explosion position in this case? 
In this case, it was formed by buying out-of-the-m oney puts and out-of-the-m oney calls in the back 
months. To counterbalance this position, I had butte rfly spreads in the front month, which would

Chunk 4125 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
profit from time decay. 
What told you the market was going to have a big move? 
You could feel it in the w ild gyrations that were occu rring by late September. 
Did you expect the move to be on the downside by that time?  191Actually, I thought it was going to be on the upside. At  first, I thought we were going to attack the 
old highs again. 
When did you change your mind? 
On Wednesday of the week before the crash, th e market fell apart. Thursday, it didn't bounce back,

Chunk 4126 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
but kind of churned. Now, if it had rallied on Frida y, then I would have been confused. But instead, 
the market cracked on Friday. At that point, I was sure we were going down. 
Because it was the end of the week? 
Yes, and there is a high correlation between th e action on a Friday and the follow-through on the 
next Moniday—at least on the opening. 
Did you have any inkling of the siize of the impending move on the following Monday?

Chunk 4127 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Do you know what I really thought was going to ha ppen Monday? I thought the market would open 
lower, go down sharply, and then bounce back to about unchanged. I actually bought out-of-the-
money calls that Friday for protection. 
But you said you thought the market was going down? 
Yes, but I just wanted to have some insurance. A trader once told me, "Saliba, in stealing second, 
you never take your hand off first until your other ha nd is on second." That's the way I am; I always

Chunk 4128 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
have insurance. 
Still, you must have been awfu lly confident that the market  was going sharply lower on 
Monday morning. According to the cover story in Success magazine [April 1988], it sounds 
like you knew the market would collapse. It says you even de liberately chose to go to the 
office instead of the floor to avoid being influe nced out of your position by all the confusion 
on the floor. Isn't that highly unusual for you to go to the office inst ead of the floor on a 
trading day?

Chunk 4129 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trading day? 
Yes, if I'm trading, I'm on the floor. But that arti cle is completely mislea ding. They wrote it that 
way to sell magazines. They make it sound like I pl anned and plotted to avoi d the floor that day. 
That's not the story. I was concerned about the positions held by my clearing firm. One guy in 
particular had a huge position, which he wasn't clos ing, and I had to spend a great deal of time on

Chunk 4130 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the phone. Now, that's not as dramatic as the way the magazine wrote it up, but that's what really 
happened. 
Didn't you also sell your seat that day? You must have been really confident the market was 
going down to sell a seat. 
I hit that seat before the market  opened. I figured if I didn't hit the bid for the seat, someone else 
would. Anyway I had seven seats; I just sold one. 
Was this the first time you traded a seat? I mean seats aren't e xactly a liquid market.

Chunk 4131 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yes, it was the first time I did it like that: tradin g the seat round turn in one  day. But I have traded 
seats before. I trade them depe nding on my mood in the market. On  balance though, I want to be 
long seats. I believe in our industry. 
But in that circumstance, it did seem like a good trade? 
I figured, "Hey, I have a lot of exposure in seat s—a few million dollars worth—I better take some

Chunk 4132 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
protection." I sold that  seat for $452,000 in the morning and bought it back the next afternoon for 
$275,000. 
How much did you make that Monday? 
That has caused me a lot of head aches. I would rather not say. 
Obviously, your big money was made in the out-o f-the-money puts. What percentage of that 
position did you keep as of Monday's close? 
About 95 percent. 
You kept most of it! But the profits were so huge. Wasn't it tempting to just take it?

Chunk 4133 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The reason I didn't cover was because I felt my long puts hadn't gone up enough. They all went to 
parity. The puts that were thirty points in-the-money were trading at  $30. In other words, the option  192premiums consisted almost entirely of intrinsic va lue; the market wasn't giving them any time value 
premium. Given the enormous market  volatility, I thought that was crazy. 
So, you figured you would wait till the next day.

Chunk 4134 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Yes, and do you know what I did to hedge my self? I bought more insurance at the close on 
Monday. I covered hundreds of my short calls. 
You were basically buying more volatility. 
It was the best thing I could have  done. The next day they didn't know what they wanted more of: 
Half the world wanted puts, and half the world wanted calls. 
But everybody wanted volatility. 
That's when the register really started ringing. It was the day that the sun was so close to the earth

Chunk 4135 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that everybody needed zinc ointment, a nd I was the only guy that had some left. 
Let's take the other side of th e fence: What did the traders who got buried in October do 
wrong? 
They took for granted that Monday would be a nor mal day. They started out long, thinking the 
market was just correcting and was due for a bounce. Then they bought on the way down; they 
bought every dip. 
Did some traders just freeze?

Chunk 4136 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
bought every dip. 
Did some traders just freeze? 
Sure, some did. I have one friend, who is a m illion-dollar annual earner. On Tuesday morning, I 
walk in and say, "Hey, Jack, what do you think? Are you going to get them today?" But he just 
stood there. He didn't say a word to me. He looked shell shocked. He just kept going over his 
sheets, looking for something to do, but not knowing what to do. So he mi ssed all the opportunity.

Chunk 4137 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Why was the way you responded to the market  so different from the way your friend 
responded? 
He wasn't sure what his position risk was. I always define my ri sk, and I don't have to worry about 
it. I walk into the pit every day with a clean slate,  so that I can take advantage of what is going on. 
A clean slate sounds like you come in with a fl at position every day, but you obviously hold 
positions overnight. 
I mean that I'm always hedged, and I'm always prepared.

Chunk 4138 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Do you always know the maximum risk in a po sition that you hold? Do you always know 
what your worst case is? 
Yes. Now, what could ha ppen? The market sits, it explodes , or something in between. But no 
matter what happens, I know my worst case. My loss is always limited. 
Why do so many traders who come to the floor end up losing everything? 
I think the biggest problem with some traders that  come on the floor is that they think they are

Chunk 4139 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
bigger than the market. They don't fear the marketpl ace, and they lose sight of their discipline and 
the hard work ethic. Those are the traders who get blown out. But most guys on the floor really 
work hard. 
What is the biggest misconception th e public has about the marketplace? 
The idea that the market has to go up for them to make money. You can make money in any kind of 
market if you use the right strategies. With future s, options, and the underl ying markets, there are

Chunk 4140 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
enough tools available to set up a game plan for any situation. 
In other words, the public has too much of a bullish bias? 
Yes, it is the American way: The market has to go up. The government never said anything about 
program trading when we were in  a three-year bull market. Once the market started going down, all 
of a sudden, program trading became a major concern, and they set up commissions galore.

Chunk 4141 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
For the average person, like my mom or dad and th eir relatives, the biggest misconception is that 
they think when the market goes up, you make money, and when it goes down, you lose. People 
need to approach it from a more neutral standpoint and say, "I'm goi ng to be a little long in this 
category and short in this category, but limit my  short-side risk because it is infinite."  193How do you handle a losing period?

Chunk 4142 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How do you lose money? It is either bad day trad ing or a losing position. If it's a bad position that 
is the problem, then you should just get out of it. 
Is that what you do? 
Yes. I either liquidate it or neut ralize it, because then you are ba ck afloat. When you are in a boat 
that springs a leak, you don't drill an other hole to let the water out. 
What if your trading losses are due to your ma king bad decisions? What do you do then?

Chunk 4143 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Take a day off. If I get myself all wound up, I like to  lay out in the sun and bake for a while and let 
all the strenuous stu ff go out of my head. 
What are the elements of good trading? 
Clear thinking, ability to stay focused, and extrem e discipline. Discipline is number one: Take a 
theory and stick with it. But you also have to be open-minded enough to sw itch tracks if you feel 
that your theory has been prove n wrong. You have to be able to say, "My method worked for this

Chunk 4144 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
type of market, but we are not in  that type of market anymore." 
Trading rules you live by. 
I scale in and scale out of  my positions, so that I can spread out my risk. I don't like to do all of a 
large order right up front. 
What else? 
Always respect the marketplace. Never take anything for granted. Do your homework. Recap the 
day. Figure out what you did right and what you di d wrong. That is one part  of the homework; the

Chunk 4145 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
other part is projec-tive. Wh at do I want to happen tomorrow? What happens if the opposite 
occurs? What happens if nothing happens? Think through all the "what-ifs. " Anticipate and plan, 
rather than react. 
When you made your first few million, did you so ck some of it away to limit your worst case 
possibility?  
No. My trading strategies were growing and I need ed new capital. Then after I made some more, I

Chunk 4146 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
started putting money into other in vestments: real estate, stores, exchange seats, and things like 
that. Then when the market crashed I hate to use that term on Monday, October 19,1 realized that I 
didn't have a big chunk of cash anywhere, so I took a couple of million dollars out of the flow and 
bought T-bills. Then, a few weeks later, I used the money to buy an annuity. 
I guess because your trading style is so focused on limiting losses, the fi rst time you felt the

Chunk 4147 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
need for a safety net was when the market seemed  to be saying that a catastrophe could occur 
and have nothing to do with you. 
Yes. What happens if you have $10 million in your trading account, but they shut down the game? 
How do you set goals? 
Until recently, I set goals on a monetary level. First,  I wanted to become a millionaire before I was 
thirty. I did it before I was twenty-five. Then I d ecided I wanted to make so much a year, and I did

Chunk 4148 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that. Originally, the goals were all numbers, but the numbers aren't so important anymore. Now, I 
want to do some things that are no t only profitable, but will also be fun. For example, I'm currently 
working on setting up a trading company and a softwa re company. I also want to do the family-type 
thing. 
How do you judge success? 
I used to judge success as being the best in your fi eld, like Bruce Springsteen in rock music. In my

Chunk 4149 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
industry, it would have to be dol lar-wise. Now, I think it is more  quality of life. A lot of people 
think I'm a success, but I don't feel like I'm a success. I really don't. I feel like I've made a lot of 
money, and I've been successful at this one area in  my life. I help the needy, but I don't have that 
family fulfillment. How do you judge success? I don't know. All I know is that all the money in the 
world isn't the answer. 
You thought it was at one time.

Chunk 4150 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
You thought it was at one time. 
Yes I did. And to be honest, money is important becau se it is influential. See that guy standing over  194there? I don't know him from Adam. But say he came over to talk to us. If he made a really bad 
first impression on me, I might not have much respect  for him. But if you th en told me that guy is 
worth $50 million, and he made it on his own, that w ould completely change my opinion of him. 
That may not be fair, but that's the way it is.

Chunk 4151 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
That may not be fair, but that's the way it is. 
How does trading affect  your personal life? 
I'm able to handle it well from a business standpoint,  but from a social standpoint it clobbers me. It 
doesn't allow me to give the time  to women and friends that they require. People like to just sit and 
talk sometimes. Unless it is about busine ss, like this with you, I'm out of here. 
Are you always that conscious of time?

Chunk 4152 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Are you always that conscious of time? 
Yes. Most people aren't. They say, "Well, don't you ever just sit home and watch TV?" 
Do you? 
Well, I might have the TV on, but my head is al ways on trading. Last night  I came back from a 
dinner date at midnight. I was tire d and wanted to go to bed, but I was up until 2:00 A.M. figuring 
out trades. It's an addiction. I used  to be much worse. I got lots of grief from former girlfriends

Chunk 4153 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
because I would take my work with me on dates.  I don't do that any more, but I'm always still 
thinking about trading. 
What makes you different? 
I think I can do anything, and I'm not afraid of ha rd work. Right now, for example, I'm working on 
a deal with a French bank to put together a tradin g company. I can't wait until this venture starts up, 
so that I can start working with these kids, trai ning them to be traders. I don't know exactly how

Chunk 4154 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
much the bank is going to give me, but I could ha ve hundreds of millions to work with. I love that 
type of challenge. 
It is important to realize that many of the great traders interviewed in this book were not 
immediately successful. Saliba's initial trading experi ence was so disastrous that it brought him to a 
near suicidal state of mind. However, what thes e traders share is a sense of self-confidence and

Chunk 4155 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
persistence. In the case of early fa ilure, these traits are enough to lead to eventual success. Besides 
allowing him to make a comeback from his early poor start, Saliba's persisten ce also came into play 
at other points in his trading car eer. For example, many others faced  with the type of constant 
ridicule that Saliba was subjected to in the Te ledyne pit might have abandoned their strategy.

Chunk 4156 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
This same Teledyne example also i llustrates another important charact eristic of the s uperior trader: 
the maintenance of rigid risk control, even in difficult circumstances. It must have been very 
tempting for Saliba to trade a larger position size in  the Teledyne pit when he was being derided as 
"one-lot." Instead, he maintained his discipline and continued to trade sm all until his capital had 
grown sufficiently to allow him to increase his position size.

Chunk 4157 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Working hard and examining many different scenarios so  that he is prepared for all contingencies is 
a critical element of Saliba's success. By anticipa ting all the "what-ifs," he  can take advantage of 
situations such as the October 19 stock slide, instead of being immobilized by such events. For 
many people, the concept of a great trader conj ures up an image of someone using a shoot-from-

Chunk 4158 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the-hip approach, moving in and out of markets with great agility and a near sixth sense. The reality 
is far less glamorous. In the majority of cases, ex ceptional traders owe their success to hard work 
and preparation. In fact, similar to Tony Saliba, many of the very successful traders will do their 
"homework" every night, not allowing leisure or ot her business from interfering with their daily

Chunk 4159 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
regimen of market analysis. When they stray from th at discipline, it usually ends up costing them 
money. In Saliba's own words, referring to a recen tly missed trade due to hi s failure to have his 
orders in while on a business trip, "It cost me ten grand, and all those little  ten grands can add up." 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  195Part V-The Psychology of Trading

Chunk 4160 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
196Dr. Van K. Tharp-The Psychology of Trading  
Dr. Van K. Tharp is a research  psychologist who received his P h.D. from the University of 
Oklahoma, Health Sciences Center, in 1975. He has spent his career studying how stress affects 
human performance. His strongest interest is in the psychology of winning—especially as winning 
applies to the markets. In 1982, Dr. Tharp devel oped his Investment Psyc hology Inventory, a test

Chunk 4161 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that measures winning and losing traits. Thous ands of investors and speculators—myself 
included—have taken this test, which include s a written evaluation and a ten-minute phone 
consultation. Dr. Tharp has written five books on su ccessful investing which provide the core of his 
investment course. He is a contributing editor for Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities 
and has also written numerous articles for other fina ncial publications. Dr. Tharp is a frequent guest

Chunk 4162 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
on financial television and radio programs, a nd has spoken at many investment conferences. 
Dr. Tharp currently devotes himself full time to counseling traders from hi s office in Glendale, 
California, and continuing his research on trading success. A recent focus of this research has been 
interviewing and studying top trader s so that he could create a mode l for success. His basic theory

Chunk 4163 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
is that by teaching the winning traits of the top traders (not specific trad ing methodologies), he can 
dramatically improve the performance of less succe ssful traders and investors. In his most recent 
project, he is attempting to turn  his most successful clients into  "supertraders" by extending his 
normal program of two two-day sessions  into an ongoing semiannual process. 
After I interviewed Dr. Tharp, he as ked whether he could do a video ta pe interview of me as part of

Chunk 4164 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
his ongoing research. Since I thoug ht such an interview might be  helpful in improving my own 
trading performance, I eagerly ag reed. The interview lasted for over four hours. Dr. Tharp has a 
particularly probing questioning st yle. After an initial response to a question, he would ask, "What 
else?" and repeat this process several times. When I could no longer think of any additional 
responses, he would have me shift the direction of  my gaze (he later explained this instruction was

Chunk 4165 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
intended to facilitate accessing different parts of my brain), and sure enough I would think of 
another point I had somehow overlooked. I felt that this interview yielded some important personal 
insights. (One of these self -realizations is br iefly discussed in the next chapter.) 
I would have liked to provide my personal impre ssion of Dr. Tharp's basic course, which includes 
five books and four tapes. However, although I revi ewed the material briefly as background for this

Chunk 4166 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
chapter, the combination of simu ltaneously working at a full-time job and writing this book did not 
leave me with enough time (or energy) to give th e course the serious attention it calls for—a 
personal project I plan for later. I can, however, attest  to the fact that one of the traders interviewed 
in this book served as a subject in Dr. Tharp's project on modeling success and was duly impressed 
with his intellect and insight into successful trading.

Chunk 4167 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
How did you first get interested in the connection between psychology and trading? 
My primary research interest  after graduate school was how  various drugs affect human 
performance. After receiving my Ph.D. in ps ychology, I spent about eight years doing fairly 
standard psychological research. For example, I help ed standardize the current  Field Sobriety Test 
Battery that police throughout the country are still using. While I wa s doing that, I also learned how

Chunk 4168 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to lose money trading options. In fact, I lost money so fast and so consistent ly that when I finally 
got out of the market, I had to conclude that th e losses had something to do with me. During that 
same time period, I enrolled in a class in prosperity  at the local Church of Religious Science. One 
of the principles taught in  that class is that what happens to  you reflects your mindset. I had read a

Chunk 4169 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
lot on the psychology of trad ing, and while I considered most of th at information to be "folklore," I 
wanted to test it out. I decided to do so by de veloping my Investment Psychology Inventory, a test 
to measure investment strengths a nd weaknesses, as a creative project for that class. No one in the 
class would take it, so I sent it to R. E. Mc Master, the editor of a newsletter to which I was

Chunk 4170 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
subscribing. McMaster took it and then offered it to his subscribers. Overall, I received close to a 
thousand responses and that re ally roused my interest in this area as a career. 
What did you learn in analyzing the responses to your test? Were there any major surprises? 
I had several measures of succe ss built into the test, so I coul d rank the responses according to

Chunk 4171 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
"success level." The investment literature suggeste d ten different areas that  might be important. As  197a result, I designed questions to measure each of t hose areas. I did a number of statistical analyses 
of the data and found a significant correlation between each area and i nvestment success. In 
addition, I found that those ten area s could be grouped into three ma jor clusters, which I label the

Chunk 4172 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
psychological factor, the management and discip line factor, and the decision-making factor. 
Although I've since refined the test, I still use the same three major cl usters. In addition, I still keep 
the ten original areas, and I've  added an extra one—intuition. 
What are the eleven areas you measure? 
Well, the psychological factor has five areas. These incl ude a well-rounded pers onal life, a positive

Chunk 4173 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
attitude, the motivation to make money, lack of conflict, and res ponsibility for results. Motivation 
to make money is not significantly correlated with su ccess, but I keep it in the test because lack of 
such motivation plus high c onflict is very significant. 
There are three factors in the decision-making area. These include  a solid knowledge of technical 
factors in the market, an aptitude for maki ng sound decisions without common biases, and the

Chunk 4174 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
ability to think independently. Inci dentally, knowledge of technical f actors has little relationship to 
success based on the test scores. 
Also, there are three management-discipline factors.  One needs risk control and the ability to be 
patient, hi addition, I also include intuition in  this category. Althou gh I have not found any 
relationship between intuition and trading success, I keep the factor in the test because it is in-
teresting to me.

Chunk 4175 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
teresting to me. 
Given those areas, what are the char acteristics of the losing trader? 
The composite profile of a losing trader would be someone who is highly stressed and has little 
protection from stress, has a negative outlook on life a nd expects the worst, has a lot of conflict in 
his/her personality, and blames others when things  go wrong. Such a person would not have a set of 
rales to guide their behavior and would be more lik ely to be a crowd follow er, hi addition, losing

Chunk 4176 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
traders tend to be disorganized and impatient. They  want action now. Most lo sing traders are not as 
bad as the composite profile would suggest. Th ey just have part of the losing profile. 
You now consult with many traders. How did you get started in that? 
After I started using the test re gularly, people began to ask me wh at to do about their particular 
problems. Since investment psychology is a rath er unique area of study, I found I didn't know how

Chunk 4177 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to respond to many of their questions. As a result, I decided to write a pamphlet on each of the ten 
areas—both to learn about the areas myself and to provide investors with a source of help. The first 
pamphlet turned into a book. I decided at that poi nt to cover the subject matter in five workbooks 
which would constitute a course in the psychology of investing/tr ading. After I finished the second

Chunk 4178 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
workbook, I started training in Neuro-Linguistic Pr ogramming (NLP). NLP is really a science of 
how to duplicate success, and I wa s able to incorporate a number  of those techniques into my 
course. The development of the course natura lly led to a private consulting service. 
Have your ideas and concepts changed from what  they were early in your research? 
I designed the test to predict who could win and who couldn't. Now, I believe that anyone can win

Chunk 4179 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
if they are committed to do so. Primar ily, it's just a matter of learning how. 
Too many people get stuck by the beliefs they hold, ye t they continue to cli ng to those old beliefs. 
My beliefs, in contrast, are constantly evolving,  and I think it's because I value them according to 
their utility. Thus, I'm w illing to admit most of my beliefs are probably wrong. For example, there 
may be people who could not be successful in trading even if they were committed to doing so. But

Chunk 4180 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
right now, it's most useful for me to believe th at anyone can win. When I hold that belief, I am 
much more effective at helping people become winners. 
Could you provide some specific case exampl es of people who succeeded or failed in 
consultation? 
One trader who came to me hadn't been able to trade for over a year. He wanted me to get him 
trading before he did the full consultation. As a result, I had him drop by one morning for about

Chunk 4181 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
forty-five minutes. I gathered some information a nd made an educated guess that he had a conflict 
problem. He then went through an exercise that took about ten minutes. It  took him two weeks to 
mentally integrate the results of that exercise, but after that he was trading again. He'd spent a lot of  198money and done a lot of things to correct the prob lem and none of it had worked. Yet, it only took a 
ten-minute exercise and two weeks of integr ating the results to solve his problem.

Chunk 4182 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I tried that with anothe r person who was unable to afford my consulting fee, for whom a simple 
exercise of that nature didn't work. His problem had nothing to do with his inves ting. Although he 
was in his late forties, he was still a little boy in  that he couldn't accept adult responsibilities. He 
still lived with his mother, and his whole lifestyle supported be ing a child. The only reason he

Chunk 4183 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
wanted to trade was to be able to continue that lifestyle. I doubt  that I could have helped him 
without a major commitment on his part to change  his lifestyle, which he was unwilling to give. 
Another client made minor adjust ments after two days of consul ting. He was reluctant to do the 
follow-up because he thought it would probably be s uperfluous. But he eventu ally decided to do it. 
I spent another two days listening to him talk and th en we did a simple exercise together. At the end

Chunk 4184 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
of that exercise, he was a totally changed person (although it probably took him a week to integrate 
the effects of that exercise). He called me tw o months later and said  he had made over $650,000 
trading in the markets. 
In the case of a trader who uses a nonquant ifiable approach (for example, "I buy or sell 
whenever I get a feeling about the market's im pending direction from the chart patterns"), 
how do you distinguish whether trading proble ms are related to lack of skill or to

Chunk 4185 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
psychological impediments to success? 
Before I take someone on as a client, I need to know that they have some  sort of methodology that 
they think works. I determine what evidence they have of that. Can they, for example, convince 
me? Have they tested that methodology? Does thei r testing amount to a hindsight evaluation, or is 
it based on actual trading signals that  one can follow. I also am convin ced that it is difficult to make

Chunk 4186 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
money day trading or trading in a short time frame, so I am skep tical about anyone  who wants me 
to help them day trade successfully. 
At the same time, I think that lack of skill is, in itself, a psychological impediment to trading. 
People don't develop a systematic approach or don't test their approach because of poor judgment, 
lack of goals, internal conflict, et c. So, perhaps the area they need help in is overcoming internal

Chunk 4187 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
resistance to developing a systema tic approach to the ma rket. If somebody came to me and said that 
was the problem they wanted help with, I would have no problem at all accepting that person as a 
client. 
What are the primary psychological impediments that keep most people  from being winning 
traders? How can they deal with each of those problems? 
What typically happens is that when people appr oach the markets, they bring their personal

Chunk 4188 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
problems with them. The markets are a natural pl ace to act out those problems, but not to solve 
them. Most people end up leaving the markets, but a few decide that they need a system to trade 
more effectively. Those people who do adopt a syst ems approach usually just end up transferring 
their problems from dealing with the market to dealing with their system of trading. 
One of the basic problems that most traders face  is dealing with risk. For example, two primary

Chunk 4189 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
rales to successful speculative trading are: Cut your losses short and let your profits ran. Most 
people cannot deal with those two rales. For exam ple, if making money is important to you—as it 
is to most people who play investment games—then you will probably have trouble taking small 
losses. As a result, small losses turn into moderate  losses, which are even harder to take. Finally, 
the moderate losses turn into big losses, which you are forced to take—all because it was so hard to

Chunk 4190 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
take a small loss. Similarly, when people have a prof it, they want to take it right away. They think, 
"I'd better take this now before it gets away." The bigger the profit becomes, th e harder it is to resist 
the temptation to take it now. The simple truth is that most people are risk-aversive in the realm of 
profits—they prefer a sure, smaller gain to a wise gamble fo r a larger gain—and risk-seeking in the

Chunk 4191 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
realm of losses—they prefer an unwise gamble to a sure loss. As a result, most people tend to do 
the opposite of what is required for success. They cut their profits short and let their losses run. 
If you think of trading as a game and that a mistak e is not following the rale s of the game, then it 
becomes much easier to follow thes e two rales. You should review your rales at the beginning of

Chunk 4192 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the day and review your trading at the end of the day. If you followed your rales, even if you lost 
money, pat yourself on the back. If  you didn't follow your rales, then  mentally rehearse what you  199did and give yourself more appr opriate choices in the future. 
The second majorproblem people have is dealing w ith stress. Stress really takes two forms: worry 
and the biological fight/flight response. Our brains have a limited capacity for processing

Chunk 4193 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
information. If your mind is preoccupied with wo rry, that worry takes up most of the decision 
space, and you don't have enough capacity left to perform effectively. 
One aspect of the fight/flight respon se is that it causes people to narrow their focus. They revert to 
earlier well-practiced response patt erns. For example, a common decision that people make under 
stress is not to decide. They do what they did when they were  a beginner. They do what their

Chunk 4194 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
broker advises. In short, they do anything simple. Simple solutions  are rarely correct. When people 
are stressed, they also tend to be crowd followers. The behavior of others provides a simple 
example to follow. Crowd followers don't have to  make decisions, but crowd following is a sure 
way to lose money in the markets. 
A second important effect of the fight/flight re sponse is that it causes people to expend more

Chunk 4195 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
energy. When faced with stressful events, people give  more effort to the few alternatives they do 
consider. They keep on doing what they were doing—only they do it harder. Putting more energy 
into trading decisions does not help you make more money. Instead you will tend to make quick, 
irrational choices, which use up some of that ex cess energy. You probably put more energy into a 
losing position by actively resisting closing it out. The result is a bigger loss. In summary, the

Chunk 4196 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
fight/flight response will decreas e your performance by causing you to narrow your choices and 
concentrate more energy on the remaining alternatives. 
The solution for dealing with stress is to work on the causes and to deve lop stress protectors. I 
would recommend that people with this problem go into a stress management program. Also, it is 
important to understand that many stressful events are such because of the way you perceive them.

Chunk 4197 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Change those perceptions and you will change th e event itself. For example, winners typically 
differ from losers in their att itude about losses. Most people become anxious about losses, yet 
successful speculators have learned that an essential ingredient to winning is to make it OK to lose. 
Since most people in our culture are taught that  only winning is acceptable, most investors must 
change their beliefs about losses to become successful.

Chunk 4198 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The third major problem that people have is deali ng with conflict. People ha ve different parts of 
themselves, each of which has a positive intention. For example, someone might have a part to 
make money, a part to protect him from failure, a part to make hi m feel good about himself, a part 
which looks after the welfare of the family, etc.  Now, once you establish these parts, you usually 
allow them to operate subconscious ly. What happens is the parts continually adopt new behaviors

Chunk 4199 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to cany out their intentions. Sometimes, those ne w behaviors can produce major conflicts. This 
model of conflict is one of  my most useful beliefs. I'm not sayi ng that people actually have parts, 
but it is very useful in helping people solve their trading problems for me to believe that. You just 
have to make them aware of their parts and then  conduct a formal negotiati on between the parts so

Chunk 4200 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that each part is satisfied. If possi ble, you also want to integrate the parts so that they join together. 
I find the concept of people having different part s in conflict with each other a little difficult 
to conceptualize. Could you provide an example? 
I worked with a floor trader whose father was fa irly successful. His father  was not a good model for 
him, however, in that he was an alcoholic. As a result, he develope d a part to protect himself from

Chunk 4201 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
being like his father. He could make about $75,000 per year trading, but if he made any more than 
that, this part kicked in to make sure that he  would not become too succe ssful. He was the one who 
made $650,000 in about two months after we had completed the parts negotiation. 
Are you implying that some peop le actually want to lose on a subconscious level because it 
fulfills some other positive intention? How common is that?

Chunk 4202 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Half the traders I work with have problems  of this nature. I think it's very common. 
So far, you've cited poor risk attitudes, stress,  and conflict as impedime nts to trading success. 
Are there any other major problems people have with the markets? 
A fourth major problem is that ma ny people allow their emotions to  control their trading. In fact, 
most trading problems appear to involve emotional control in some  manner. I know of at least ten

Chunk 4203 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
methods of helping people control their mental st ates. An easy method that people can adopt right  200away is simply to control posture, breathing, and muscle tension. If you change those factors, you 
will probably find that you change your emotional state. 
Finally, the last major problem is making decisi ons. Although there are many facets to decision-
making problems, what most peopl e do is bring their normal method of making decisions to trading

Chunk 4204 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the markets. For example, think about what you go through in order to buy a new car.  You have to 
think about the model, make, deal, service, cost, accessories, etc. And it probably takes you a week 
or more to evaluate those factors and make a decision. Most people bring that same method of 
making decisions to trading and it ju st doesn't work. It takes too much time. So, the solution is to 
adopt a trading system that gives you signals to act. But most people with a trading system continue

Chunk 4205 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to apply their normal method of ma king decisions to the signals given to them by their trading 
system. And, of course, that doesn't work. The best method that I've found of dealing with long, 
ineffective decision-making problems is to short circuit them through a process called anchoring. 
That process is a little to o involved to explain here. 
Do you believe that most people can be successf ul traders if they learn to eliminate negative 
emotions?

Chunk 4206 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
emotions? 
Well, that assumes that negative emotions are the cause of trading problems. I think they are just a 
symptom of the basic problem. In most cases, I don' t believe it's even necessa ry to solve specific 
problems to produce success—you simply have to teach  people to do things in an effective manner. 
The teaching process, however, involves working with how people think, and most trainers do not 
emphasize that.

Chunk 4207 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
emphasize that. 
Right now, I consider myself to be an expert modeler. By that , I mean that if someone can do 
something well, then I can figure out how they do it and teach those skills to anyone else. I'm 
concentrating on modeling trading and investment excellence. So naturally, I believe that I can 
teach anyone who is committed to being a successful trader to be one of the best. 
Are superior traders better becaus e of keener analytical skills, or because they have better

Chunk 4208 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
emotional control? 
Better emotional control, but  I think that both of thos e factors are overemphasized. 
So what does it take to  duplicate successful trading? 
There are three primary factors i nvolved in duplicating success—belief s, mental states, and mental 
strategies. If you duplicate the way the best traders use t hose three factors for every aspect of the 
trading task, then you can duplicat e their results. As a nontrading example, most martial arts

Chunk 4209 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
experts believe that it takes years of practice to break a board with your bare hand. I was able to 
observe someone for about fifteen minutes and then break two k-in ch pine boards with my hand. I 
even showed my son (who was ten at the time) how to do it. That's the power behind modeling. 
What happens with most experts is that they are unconsciously competent. They do things well, 
which means they do them automatically. For ex ample, most people are unconsciously competent

Chunk 4210 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
at driving a car. You don't even think about it when you do it. When someone  who is unconsciously 
competent tries to explain what he or she is doin g to someone else, much of what is important is 
left out. Thus, my focus is to discover the missing pieces and help people install those pieces. 
Let's talk about the first factor: beliefs. Ho w are beliefs important to trading success? 
Let me give you an example from another modeling project. The Army modeled the rifle skills of

Chunk 4211 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
the two best sharpshooters in the U.S. They were then able to develop a training class for Army 
recruits in which they reduced the training ti me from four to two da ys, while increasing the 
qualification rate from 80 to 100 percent. In addi tion, they were able to use the same knowledge to 
help the top shooters improve their skills. The info rmation they gathered about shooting beliefs was 
particularly revealing. 
The two top shooters, for example, believed:

Chunk 4212 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The two top shooters, for example, believed: 
• Shooting well is important for my survival. 
• Hunting is fun. 
• Mental rehearsal is importan t to successful performance. 
• If I miss a shot, it has something to do with my performance.  201One of the two top shooters, when they were in  competition together, always won. And you 
could tell the difference between the two in acco rdance with their beliefs. For example, the

Chunk 4213 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
best shooter believed that it was important to rehearse an entire 1,000-round match the prior 
evening, whereas the second best shooter only belie ved that mental rehearsal was important. 
In addition, the best shooter believed that it was important to hit the center of the bull's eye 
on each shot (even though you didn't get ex tra points for that), whereas the second best 
shooter believed that it was only important to hit the bull's eye. Can you understand why one

Chunk 4214 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
was better than the other just from their beliefs? 
Now, contrast the beliefs of top shooters with the beliefs of new recruits coming into the Army. 
The latter might believe: 
• Guns are evil; they kill people. 
• If they shoot this weapon t oo many times, they might go deaf. 
• If they miss the target, it means the gun is misaligned. 
I think, just on beliefs alone, you can  begin to understand why the t op shooters were so much better 
than the raw recruits.

Chunk 4215 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
than the raw recruits. 
Now, let me explain some of my  findings in working with top tr aders. You might find some of 
these beliefs confirmed in other interviews in your book. Generally, I find that top traders believe: 
• Money is NOT important. 
• It is OK to lose in the markets. 
• Trading is a game. 
• Mental rehearsal is important for success. 
• They've won the game before they start. 
Although there are a lot more than five critical beliefs, I think these five are among the most

Chunk 4216 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
important. Most people approach trading to make a lot of money, and that is one of the primary 
reasons they lose. Because money is so importa nt, they have trouble ta king losses and letting 
profits ran. In contrast, when you think of trading as a game and play by certain rules, then it 
becomes much easier to follow those two golden rales. 
In addition, because of mental rehearsal and ex tensive planning, top traders have already gone

Chunk 4217 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
through all the trial and error in their mind before th ey begin. As a result, they know they are going 
to win in the long ran, and that makes the little setbacks much easier to deal with. 
You mentioned that winners know they've won the game before they start. Although I can 
easily see how such confidence would be benefi cial for the establishe d winning trader, might 
the impact of this trait actually be reversed for the novice trader? For example, in your first

Chunk 4218 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
week on skis, confidence about your ability to go down the expert slope might not be such a 
great quality. How does the less expert trad er distinguish between justified and misplaced 
confidence? 
The top traders that I've worked with began thei r careers with an extensive study of the markets. 
They developed and refined models of how to trade.  They mentally rehearsed what they wanted to 
do extensively until th ey had the belief that they would wi n. At this point, they had both the

Chunk 4219 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
confidence and the commitment nece ssary to produce success. In addi tion, they also had the entire 
constellation of beliefs I just described. As a result,  I believe that there are three major differences 
between justified confidence and mi splaced confidence. First of all, justified confidence comes 
from a constellation of beliefs, such as the one I just described. If a tr ader has confidence and

Chunk 4220 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
nothing else, he is probably in a lot of trouble. Second, justified confidence comes from extensive 
testing of some sort of model of trading. If you don't have a m odel that you have properly tested, 
then your confidence is probably misplaced. Third, justified confidence come s with an extensive 
commitment to being successful as a trader. Mo st people who want to be traders are not com-
mitted—they just think they are. There is a poem  by W. N. Murray, of the Scottish Himalayan

Chunk 4221 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
expedition, that says: "That the moment that one definitely co mmits oneself, then Providence 
moves too." 
If you are really committed, then not only are you certain that you are doing the right thing, but 
somehow events just seem to occur to help you. If  you are really committed to  being a trader, then 
you probably have an understanding at some level of what I'm talking about. You probably even

Chunk 4222 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
understand that those events th at help you might be big losses. If you are not committed, on the  202other hand, then you are probably saying, "I don't understand what Tharp is saying. I'm committed, 
but events certainly have not been helping me." 
Earlier, you mentioned "mental states" as th e second critical factor in modeling success. 
Could you explain what you mean by that? 
If you ask people to list their trad ing or investment problems, they  are of two types—problems they

Chunk 4223 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
don't own and mental state control problems. Pr oblems they don't own consist of blaming the 
markets, blaming floor traders or  locals, blaming insider trading, blaming their broker, or blaming 
their system for what goes wrong. We have a natu ral tendency to blame something other than 
ourselves for what happens. Society promotes it. For example, the recent media coverage of 
program trading virtually implies that investors w ho lost money in the stock market did so because

Chunk 4224 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
of this activity, rather than because of any fault of their own. Yet, when you blame something other 
than yourself, you can continue to repeat the mistake because it was the result of something beyond 
your control. 
The best thing an investor can do, when things go wrong, is to determine how he or she produced 
those results. Now, I don't mean that you should bl ame yourself for your mistakes either. I mean

Chunk 4225 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that at some point in time, for any situation,  you made a choice that produced those results. 
Determine what that choice point was and give your self other options to take when you encounter a 
similar choice point in the future. Change the decisi on at similar choice points in the future and you 
will change the results you get. And by imagini ng doing so now, you can make it easy to select 
those alternatives in the future.

Chunk 4226 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
those alternatives in the future. 
When people own their own problems, they discover th at their results usually stem from some sort 
of mental state. Common examples are: 
• I'm too impatient with the markets. 
• I get angry at the markets. 
• I'm afraid at the wrong time. 
• I'm too optimistic about what will happen. 
These are just a few examples of  mental state problems. Once you identify a mental state problem,

Chunk 4227 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
you can do something about it because this sort of problem is within your control. I've already 
mentioned how one can use body post ure, breaming, and muscle contro l to manipulate one's mental 
state. To try this out for yourself, go into a shopping mall and notice how other people walk. 
Duplicate a dozen or so walks fo r yourself and notice how your mental state changes with each one. 
I'm not saying that controlling your mental state is the magic soluti on to trading success. It's just

Chunk 4228 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
part of the answer. But when you admit that the an swer is within yourself, you've come a long way. 
The realization that you are res ponsible for the results you get is the key to success ful investing. 
Winners know they are responsible for th eir results; losers think they are not. 
Can you give a practical example of how someone can control their mental state? 
Well, mental state manipulation is what most pe ople call discipline. I teach  people a very simple

Chunk 4229 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
procedure that they can use righ t away. For example, suppose you ar e at your desk and you become 
aware that you are in a mental st ate that you would like to change . Get up out of the chair. Walk 
away about four feet and then look at how you looked in that chair. Notice you r posture, your 
breathing, your facial expr essions. Then imagine how you would look if you had the sort of mental 
state you would like. When you can see that clearly, sit down in th e chair again and assume the

Chunk 4230 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
position that you just imagined. That exercise works for almost any situation as it involves several 
important principles—changing your body postur e, seeing yourself fr om a more objective 
viewooint, and imagining a more resourceful state. 
Please elaborate on mental st rategies—the third element you cited earlier as critical to 
duplicating success. Could you  provide some examples? 
To understand strategies, you have to understand how people think. People think in the same

Chunk 4231 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
modalities as their five senses, that is, in terms of visual images, sounds, feelings, and for some 
people, tastes and smells. Those five modalities are to  mental strategies as the alphabet is to a great 
novel, or as musical notes are to  a great symphony. It's not the el ements, but the way in which the 
elements are put together. A mental strate gy is really the sequence in which you think.

Chunk 4232 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Rather than explain a complex topi c in detail, which I think is beyond the scope of this interview,  203let me give you two examples. Firs t, imagine that you have a tradi ng system that gives you specific 
signals. Since most signals are visual, such as a pa rticular chart pattern or  certain signals on your 
computer, imagine that your system gives you visual  signals. Now, try on the following strategy: 
• See the signal. 
• Recognize that it is familiar.

Chunk 4233 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
• Recognize that it is familiar. 
• Tell yourself what might go wrong if you take it. 
• Feel bad about it. 
Could you trade effectively using that strategy? Would you even take the signal? Probably not! 
What if you used the following strategy? 
• See the signal. 
• Recognize that it is familiar. 
• Feel good about it. 
Could you trade from that signal? Probably. So even though the two strategies are quite similar,

Chunk 4234 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
they lead to very different result s in terms of trading. If you are trading a sy stem, you need a simple 
strategy like the last one in  order to use it effectively. 
Two of the top traders that you  used in your research in modeling success have completely 
different trading styles. One is very mechanic al, while the other uses a much more intuitive 
approach. Could you contrast their diffe rences and compare their similarities?

Chunk 4235 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
First, let me talk about their similarities, because they are ex tensive. In fact, when you find 
extensive similarities between two excellent traders who seem so different, then you can begin to 
assume that those similarities are essential to  successful trading. Both traders, for example, 
developed models for how the markets work and did extensive research to test those models. 
Although their ideas are very differe nt, I think the process of devel oping and testing some sort of

Chunk 4236 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
model is probably very important. In addition, both traders share all the same beliefs that I men-
tioned earlier as common to successful traders. Th ird, both traders are very aware of their purpose 
in life and as a trader. They believe they are part  of a "bigger picture" and they just go with the 
flow. 
The mechanical trader is very logical. He construc ts his models visually in his imagination. He is

Chunk 4237 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
very precise in his language and thinking. His mode ls tend to focus on his concept of how to trade 
successfully and of how the economy works. He does not believe that his models are adequate until 
they can be converted into algorith ms for the computer that match his own mental processes. As a 
result of this belief, he has computerized his models, modifying both his constructed image and his

Chunk 4238 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
computer output, until both models match—in his wo rds, "until they both look right." This is a very 
slow and laborious process. I think it hinders his decision making on everyday events, and he tends 
to agree with me, but it helps him in the long ru n. When his mental image and the computer model 
match, he virtually takes himself out of the trad ing picture. The computer does everything, so at 
that point, decision making is easy for him.

Chunk 4239 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that point, decision making is easy for him. 
The intuitive trader, in contrast , has developed a model of how he  thinks markets operate, rather 
than a model of how to trade suc cessfully. He also believes that the markets are constantly evolving 
and that it is more important to keep up with changes in the market  than to test his models by 
developing an algorithm to computerize them. He trad es from his expectations of what the markets

Chunk 4240 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
will do, which are visualizations. But I think that  he tends to convert his visualizations into 
feelings. Feelings actually are a mode of thinking, but they are difficult to communicate to others or 
to computerize. As a result, he believes that exer cises such as computerizing a trading system are a 
waste of time. Remember that his main emphasis is  to explain how markets work (rather than how

Chunk 4241 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to trade), and he believes that the markets are constantly evolving. As a result, he has difficulty 
explaining how he trades to anyone else. He just calls it  intuitive. At  the same time, he makes day-
to-day decisions easily—a distinct contrast to the mechanical trader who is uncomfortable until he 
has proven his work by computerizing it. 
What are the most difficult problems to solve? 
I think there are only two difficult problems. One is  lack of commitment to trading. People are not

Chunk 4242 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
going to do what I tell them to do unless they are committed to be coming a good trader, so I don't 
see many noncommitted traders. It's only o ccasionally, when I do a free or reduced-rate  204consultation, that I see traders w ith this sort of problem. The ma n who wanted to remain a little 
boy, and was trying to use trading as a means of accomplishing that, was a classic example. I don't 
make the mistake of seeing noncommitted traders too often.

Chunk 4243 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The second most difficult situation is the trader  who does not own his problems. This person can 
continue to repeat his problems because he never ge ts at the source. Once again, I usually don't see 
these people. When people come to me, they r ealize that they produce their own problems, 
although, to some extent, everyone has problem s that they don't own—even my clients. 
Among the people who come to see me, I think the mo st difficult type is the compulsive gambler.

Chunk 4244 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Since these people typically crave the action of the markets, they are not likely to want my help 
until they are heavily into debt. At  that point, I refer them to Gamblers Anonymous or to some local 
source forhelp. However, I have had one compulsi ve trader among my clients. He's now in my 
super-trader program. I've simply channeled his compulsiveness from the markets into working on 
himself. 
I'm not sure that correcting trading problems is always the answer though. For example, one

Chunk 4245 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
approach to teaching a class on trading would be to give everyone  the fundamentals in the first 
session and a simple trading syst em in the second. You could then spend the remaining sessions 
dealing with their problems trading that system. Th at would probably be a ve ry effective class. On 
the other hand, you could conduct the same class by giving them the fundamentals. Then you might 
give them the beliefs, mental st ates, and mental strategies necessa ry to trade the system. Finally,

Chunk 4246 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
you might give them the system. I'm willing to bet that the second method would be more effective 
than the first. At least that  is the direction I'm heading. 
Talk about the origins, concepts, and direction of your super-trader program. 
It all began on Christmas Eve one y ear, when that one trader called and told me that he had made 
$650,000 in the two months since I had finished worki ng with him. In a sense, I felt that we had

Chunk 4247 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
only started working together. Th e more I thought about it, the more the question kept popping into 
my mind: "What if we pushed this to the limits? What is he capable of accomplishing?" So the idea 
of the super-trader program was born from those t houghts. I called him up and suggested the idea to 
him. Naturally, he was all for it. 
About four of my clients have now  graduated to the super-trader pr ogram. It simply means that I

Chunk 4248 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
continue to work with these peopl e on a regular basis (usually semiar mualry). The idea is to stretch 
their performance to the limits. Many people aren't  ready for that, but I have enough among my 
clients who are. Who knows, in thre e or four years, I might just ha ve about fifty top traders that I 
work with on a continual basis! Incidentally, I fi nd that my best clients now make excellent models 
to use to study top traders.

Chunk 4249 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to use to study top traders. 
I sometimes have dreams which involve impe nding market direction. Although these are 
rather infrequent, they prove right a high percentage of the time. Is this unusual? 
I imagine that it's quite common because people tell me  that all the time, especially top traders. For 
example, both the mechanical and intuitive super-tra ders that we ta lked about earlier expressed that

Chunk 4250 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
they had dreams about the market that were am azingly accurate. But most traders say that such 
dreams are infrequent enough so th at they could not trade on th em regularly. This phenomenon 
may even occur more frequently than one might imagine—in symbolic form. But most people do 
not bother to interpret their dreams, so they miss the symbolic predictions. However, I must admit 
that although it interests me, I have not i nvestigated this area very extensively.

Chunk 4251 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I know of lots of people of genius level who clai m that some of their cr eativity comes from their 
dreams. Michael Jackson claims he doesn't wr ite his songs—they just come to him. Paul 
McCartney said that he heard th e song "Yesterday" in a dream. Einstein essentially dreamed the 
theory of relativity. I think ther e are probably a lot of famous exam ples of this sort. It all boils 
down to what intuition really  is, but don't ask me to expl ain it. I don't understand it—YET!

Chunk 4252 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
I assume that the reason you have  not tried trading again is that  you perceive that it would 
interfere with your objectivity in  dealing with your clients. Yet, given all that you have 
learned about successful trading during the past five years, I imagine there must be some 
temptation to try it again. How do you handle this  conflict? What do you e nvision as the long-term 
resolution?   205There are two reasons I don't trade. The first is the reason you mentioned about objectivity with

Chunk 4253 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
clients. If I'm helping someone trade and I ha ve conflicting positions, then I may not be very 
objective about what they are doing. An equally im portant reason, however, is that I am fully com-
mitted to doing what I am doing. I love helping ot her people, writing, giving talks, and so on. I'm 
very happy doing that. It is also a sixty-hour per w eek job right now. If I wanted to start trading, 
then I would have to devote almost as much tim e to doing that, at least at the beginning. Why

Chunk 4254 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
should I do that and give up what  I already know I love doing? Pl ayer coaches, in the history of 
most sports, usually are not that eff ective at either coaching or playing. 
Your question also assumes that I am committed to trade, and as a result there is a conflict. 
Actually, I find that as I get more and more into  helping others become successful, I have less and 
less interest in trading myself. I'm investing in myself and in my business right now. I constantly

Chunk 4255 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
work at improving my skills and knowledge, and that is paying off forme. Why should I dilute that 
effort? Perhaps some time in the future, I will decide that I have done everything I can do, or 
perhaps I'll want to change what I'm doing, or perh aps I'll just want a brea k. For example, three to 
four years from now I might just be working with fifty or more t op quality traders. If that happens, 
then maybe I'll also trade. But for the near future, it doesn't seem very likely.

206The Trade-A Personal Experience  
In the course of conducting the interviews for th is book, I came to realize that one of my primary 
motives for the entire project wa s a quest for self-discovery. Alt hough I have been a net profitable 
trader over the years (substantially multiplying a small initial stake on two separate occasions), I 
had a definite sense of failure about my tradi ng. Given the extent of my  knowledge and experience

Chunk 4257 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
about markets and trading, as well as the fact  that on numerous occasions I had correctly 
anticipated major price moves, I felt that my wi nnings were small potatoes compared to what I 
should have made. 
In one of my trips for this book, on one evening, I was interviewed at length about my trading by 
Dr. Van Tharp, and the very next  evening, I had a probing conversat ion about my trading with the 
very perceptive Ed Seykota. This back-to-back experience caused me to focus intensely on the

Chunk 4258 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
flaws that had prevented me from reaching what I perceived to be my true potential as a trader. 
As a result of this self-examination, I came to reali ze that one of my great errors had been failing to 
exploit major price moves that I had correctly anticipated. Invariab ly, my initial position would be 
far too small, given the potential I perceived in such trades. This mistake was then compounded by

Chunk 4259 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
a highly premature liquidation of the position. Typicall y, I would take profits on the first leg of the 
price move, with the intention of reentering th e position on a correction. The problem was that 
subsequent corrections usually fell short of my reentry points and, refusing to chase the market, I 
ended up watching the rest of the price move unfold while I was on th e sidelines. I vowed to myself

that the next time such a situation would arise, I w ould make a concentrated effort to come closer to 
realizing the true potential of the trade. 
I did not have to wait very long. Two weeks late r, while on a plane to Chicago to conduct some 
further interviews, I was thinking about my review  of the price charts th e previous evening. I 
recalled that I had come away with the distinct imp ression that precious meta l prices were ready to

Chunk 4261 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
move higher, even though the foreign currency ma rkets appeared vulnerable to further price 
erosion. Suddenly, the trade I should have made became crystal clear. Given my combination of 
expectations, a trade of long prec ious metals and short foreign cu rrencies would be particularly 
attractive. (Since these markets normally move  in the same direction, the combined position 
implied less risk than an outri ght long position in pr ecious metals.) I made a mental note to

Chunk 4262 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
generate some charts on this trade at my first opportunity. 
The next morning, I found a quote machine capable of generating price ch arts and sat down to 
evaluate various price relationships . First, I looked at the interrel ationships between silver, gold, 
and platinum and decided that silver was my pr eferred buy among the metals. Then I reviewed the 
interrelationships between the various foreign curre ncies and decided that the Swiss franc appeared

Chunk 4263 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
to be the weakest currency. Having made these tw o determinations, I then reviewed charts of the 
silver/Swiss franc ratio for various time spect rums, ranging from ten years to one month. 
This analysis led me to the conclusion that we were at the brink of a possible multiyear advance of 
silver relative to the Swiss franc. Although I had intended not to trad e because my traveling 
prevented me from paying attention to the market s, the potential of the trade seemed so dynamic

Chunk 4264 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that I had to put on at least a base position. To be done properly, a ratio trade requires 
approximately equal dollar positions in each market. I quickly calculated that at the prevailing price 
levels, it would require approximately three long s ilver contracts to balance one short Swiss franc 
contract. 
I looked at a short-term chart of the silver/Swiss franc pr ice ratio. To my dismay, the price ratio had

Chunk 4265 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
already moved sharply in the direction of my in tended trade since my r ealization about it the 
previous morning. Even on that morning's opening, th e trade could have been implemented at much 
more favorable price levels. As I was trying to decide what to do, the silver/Swiss franc ratio 
continued to move higher and higher. I decided th at I had to act to prev ent the possibility of 
missing this trade altogether. I im mediately called in an order esta blishing the minimum position of

Chunk 4266 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
long three silver contracts and s hort one Swiss franc contract. No sooner had I placed the order than 
the price ratio seemed to reach its peak and bega n retreating. The ratio pulled back further during 
the next two days. As it turned out, I had managed to implement the trade at the exact worst 
possible moment in time since the inception of my idea. However, the silver/Swiss franc price ratio  207quickly recovered, and a few days later I was well ahead.

Chunk 4267 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
At this point, I thought about my recent realizati on regarding my continued failure to adequately 
profit from major price moves. I decided to mainta in my position and, moreover, selected a reaction 
point for doubling up the position. The correction came about a week later and I followed my game 
plan. My timing proved good, as the trade once again rebounded in my favor—this time with 
double the initial position. Given my account size (approximately $70,000 at the time), the long six

Chunk 4268 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
silver/short two Swiss franc posi tion was about twice as large as the one I normally would have 
held. My efforts to correct my aforementioned tradi ng flaw seemed to be paying off, as the trade 
raced in my favor during the following two weeks.  Within a month of putting on the trade, my 
account was up over 30 percent. 
I now faced a dilemma: On the one hand, my new- found realization suggested that I hang on to the

Chunk 4269 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trade for the long run. On the other hand, one of my other rales is that if you are ever lucky enough 
to realize a very large profit on a trade very quickly, take it, because you will usually get an 
opportunity to reenter the trade at considerably mo re favorable levels. The second rale came to 
mind when the silver/Swiss fr anc price ratio began falling. 
A cursory examination of the price charts suggeste d it might be prudent to take at least partial

Chunk 4270 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
profits. I should have done more analysis to reach a decision. However, the combination of having 
undertaken a new job, while at the same time writin g this book, left me with  very little time and 
energy to focus on other areas—trading included. Instead of doing the necessary work, I made a 
snap judgment to stay with the trade. 
The trade now moved swiftly agains t me, and within a week, I had given back a si gnificant portion 
of my earlier gains.

Chunk 4271 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
of my earlier gains. 
Although a week earlier, I had ratio nalized that my substantial profits would give me enough of a 
comfort cushion in the event of a reaction, now that  such a reaction had occu rred, I found that I had 
seriously misjudged my comfort level. Suddenly, I was concerned that I might give back all my 
profits, and possibly even ride the trade into a loss.  I could not decide whether to blow out of the 
trade or stay with it as initially planned.

Chunk 4272 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
trade or stay with it as initially planned. 
That night I had a dream. I was talking to a friend of mine, who is a devel oper of software for the 
analysis of futures and options markets, but not  a trader. In my dream, he had begun trading. We 
were talking about trading and my current di lemma regarding the silver/Swiss franc position. 
My friend commented on my predicament, "Everybody gets what they want out of the markets." I

Chunk 4273 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
replied, "You sound just like Ed Seykota." This sounde d a bit odd to me, since as far as I knew, he 
did not even know Seykota. To my surprise, he an swered, "I have been talking to Ed Seykota for a 
while and I have been winning in my trading ever since." 
He had a sheet in front of him, with one of  the columns indicating his month-to-month ending 
equity. I glanced at the sheet and was astounded to see that the last figure exceeded $18 million. I

Chunk 4274 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
exclaimed, "Bert, you have made $18 million in th e market! I hope you plan to take a few million 
out for safekeeping." "No, I need all the money for tr ading," he replied. "But that is crazy," I said. 
"Take $3 or $4 million out, and that way you will be  sure then that no matter what happens, you 
will come out way ahead." "I know what I am doing, and as long as I do my homework on the 
markets every day, I am not concerned," he replied.

Chunk 4275 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
His answer had implied, quite correctly, that I di d not diligently do my homework on the markets 
every day. His point, although unstated, was quite clear : If I did my work on the markets every day, 
I wouldn't have any trouble understanding why he did not need to pull out se veral million dollars in 
profits from his account to feel c onfident that he would not lose back all his profits in trading.

Chunk 4276 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
"You say you don't have enough time each day to do your work on the markets. You are too busy 
with your new job and writing your book. Here, le tme show you something." He started citing 
assumptions regarding the sales of my book, royaltie s per copy sold, and the total hours I had spent 
writing the book. He then scribbled various calcula tions on a yellow pad. He arrived at a final 
figure of $18.50 per hour. "Here," he said, "this is  what you are making on your book." The tone of

Chunk 4277 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
his voice implied that I was crazy to jeopardize tens of thousands of dollars in my trading for such a 
paltry sum. (Actually, the $18.50 estimate is probably  wildly overinflated, but remember this was a 
dream.) 
It was no coincidence that this dream occurred th e night after editing the section of the Marty  208Schwartz interview dealing with  his diligence in doing his da ily homework on the markets. I

Chunk 4278 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
realized that there are no shortcuts. If you want  to be a good trader, you have to do your work on 
the markets every day. If there is not enough time, you have to make time. The costs for straying 
from this daily discipline, in terms of lost profit oppor tunities as well as losses, can be very 
substantial. The message my subconscious seemed  to be crying out was:  If you are going to be 
serious about trading, you have to reestablish your time priorities.

Chunk 4279 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
209Postscript-Dreams and Trading  
The relationship between dreams and trading is a fascinating subject. Readers may look up 
Seykota's and Tharp's comments on this matter. Th ere was another interview in which this topic 
was prominently discussed. In that instance, the tr ader decided to rescind his approval for use of

Chunk 4280 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
our conversation in the book. I wa s somewhat puzzled by his de cision, since the chapter was 
basically complimentary. "What could you possibl y have found so offensive as to back out 
completely?" I asked. "Absolut ely nothing," he replied. "In f act, you made me sound almost 
human." It turned out that he was upset about his inclusion in a recently published book and that he 
was adamantly opposed to his ap pearance in any book. Even the offer of anonymity failed to

Chunk 4281 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
change his decision. I did, however, manage to get his permission to use th e dream-related portion 
of the interview. (The name references in the following conversation have been changed.) 
In 1980, the year when corn set its record high, I was long the position limit. One night I had the 
following dream. I'm talking to myself and I say, "Hey Jerry, where is corn  going to?" "To $4.15." 
"Where is corn now?" "$4.07." "You mean you are taki ng all that risk for an extra eight cents? Are

Chunk 4282 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
you crazy?" I woke up in a flash. I knew I had to get out of my en tire corn position as soon as the 
market opened the next day. 
The next morning, the market opened up a little hi gher, and I started selling. The market moved a 
little higher, and I sold more heavily. The market moved up some more. For a minute, I thought the 
floor broker had executed my or der backwards. He hadn't. 
Anyway, a few minutes later, I'm completely out of my position and the phone rings. It's my friend

Chunk 4283 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Carl, another good trader, who had al so been long corn. He says, "J erry, is that you doing all the 
selling?" I tell him, "Yes, I just got out of my  entire position." "What are you doing?" he shouts. I 
say, "Carl, where is corn going to?" "About $4.15-4.20," he  replies. "Where is  corn now?" I ask 
him. I hear an immediate click over the phone . He didn't even waste any time saying good-bye. 
And was that the top of the corn market?

Chunk 4284 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
And was that the top of the corn market? 
It might have gone up another day, but that was just about the high. Once it started falling, I could 
never have unloaded a position of my size. 
I found this trader's narration of his dream partic ularly fascinating, since I have occasionally had 
similar experiences. Usually, I have found that wh en you feel strongly en ough about a trade (either 
getting in or getting out) to dream about it, the me ssage should be heeded. Of course, like anything

Chunk 4285 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
else, this does not work all the time, but I believe it places the odds more in your favor. 
As I interpret it, the dream is the means by wh ich our subconscious penetrates the barriers we 
sometimes erect in accepting the true analysis of a market. For example, if I am bullish and not in a 
market, I might rationalize that it is prudent to wa it for a reaction before en tering the trade—even if

Chunk 4286 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
a realistic assessment would suggest that such a de velopment is unlikely. This is because entering 
the market at a higher price is a confirmation that, to some extent, I have al ready failed (that is, by 
not buying sooner)—a distasteful acknowledgment. In such a case, a dream that the market was 
going to run away on the upside might be the subconscious' way of breaking through mental 
impediments.

211Final Word  
There is no holy grail to trad ing success. The methodologies em ployed by the "market wizards" 
cover the entire spectrum from purely technical to purely fundame ntal—and everything in between. 
The length of time they typically ho ld a trade ranges from minutes to  years. Although the styles of 
the traders are very different, many common denominators were evident:

Chunk 4288 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
1. All those interviewed had a driving desire to  become successful traders—in many cases, 
overcoming significant obstacles to reach their goal. 
2. All reflected confidence that they  could continue to win over th e long run. Almost invariably, 
they considered their own trading as the be st and safest investment for their money. 
3. Each trader had found a methodology that worked for him and remained true to that approach. It

Chunk 4289 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
is significant that discipline was the word most frequently mentioned. 
4. The top traders take their trading very serious ly; most devote a substantial amount of their 
waking hours to market analysis and trading strategy. 
5. Rigid risk control is one of the key elements in the trading strategy of virtually all those 
interviewed. 
6. In a variety of ways, many of th e traders stressed the importance of having the patience to wait 
for the right trad ing opportunity to present itself.

Chunk 4290 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):

  213Appendix 1-Program Trading and Portfolio Insurance  
One subject that has received widespread publicity  in recent years is program trading. Perhaps

Chunk 4291 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
never in the history of financial markets has there been more critic ism about a trading approach that 
was less understood. I would venture a guess that  less than one out of ten people opposed to 
program trading even know the de finition of the term. One source of confusion is  that program 
trading is used interchangeably to describe both the original activity and as  a more general term 
encompassing various computer-sup ported trading strategi es (for example, portfolio insurance).

Chunk 4292 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Program trading represents a clas sic arbitrage activity in which one market is bought against an 
equal short sale in a closely related market in order to realize small, near risk-free profits, resulting 
from short-lived distortions in the price relations hip between such markets. Program traders buy or 
sell an actual basket of stocks against an equa l dollar value position in stock index futures when

Chunk 4293 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
they perceive the actual stocks to be underpriced or overpriced relative to futures. In effect, 
program trading tends to keep actual stock and stoc k index futures prices in line. Insofar as every 
program-related sale of actual stocks is offset  by a purchase at another time and most program 
trades are first initiated as long stock/short futures positions (because of the uptick requirement in

Chunk 4294 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
shorting actual stocks), arguments that program trad ing is responsible for stock market declines are 
highly tenuous. Moreover, since the bulk of econom ic evidence indicates th at arbitrage between 
related markets tends to reduce volatility, the rela tionship between increased volatility and program 
trading is questionable at best. 
Portfolio insurance refers to the systematic sale of stoc k index futures as th e value of a stock

Chunk 4295 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
portfolio declines in order to reduce risk ex posure. Once reduced, the net long exposure is 
increased back toward a full position as the repres entative stock index price increases. The theory 
underlying portfolio insurance presumes that mark et prices move smoothl y. When prices witness 
an abrupt, huge move, the results of the strategy may differ substantially from the theory. This 
occurred on October 19, 1987, when prices gapped be yond threshold portfolio insurance sell levels,

Chunk 4296 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
triggering an avalanche of sell orders which were executed far below the theoretical levels. 
Although portfolio insurance may have accelerated the decline on October 19, it could reasonably 
be argued that the underlying forc es would have resulted in a si milar price decline over a greater 
span of days in the absence of por tfolio insurance. This is a questi on that can never be answered. (It

Chunk 4297 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
is doubtful that program trading, as defined above, pl ayed much of a role in the crash of the week 
of October 19, since the severely delayed openi ngs of individual stocks, tremendous confusion 
related to prevailing price levels , and exchange restrictions rega rding the use of the automated 
order entry systems severely impeded this activity.) 
  214Appendix 2 - Options—Understanding the Basics*

Chunk 4298 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
There are two basic type s of options: calls and puts. The purchase of a call option provides the 
buyer with the right—but not the obligation— to pur chase the underlying item at a specified price, 
called the strike or exercise price, at any time up to and including the expiration date. Aput option 
provides the buyer with the right—but not the oblig ation—to sell the underlyi ng item at the strike

Chunk 4299 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
price at any time prior to expiration. (N ote, therefore, that buying a put is a bearish trade, while 
selling a put is a bullish trade.) The price of an option is called a premium. As an example of an 
option, an IBM April 130 call gives the purchaser  the right to buy 100 shares of IBM at $130 per 
share at any time during the life of the option. 
The buyer of a call seeks to profit from an anticipated price rise by  locking in a specified purchase

Chunk 4300 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
price. The call buyer's maximum possible loss will be equal to the dollar amount of the premium 
paid for the option. This maximum loss would occur on an option held  until expiration if the strike 
price was above the prevailing market price. Fo r example, if IBM was trading at $125 when the 
130 option expired, the option would expire worthle ss. If at expiration, the price of the underlying 
market was above the strike price, the optio n would have some value and would hence be

Chunk 4301 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
exercised. However, if the difference between the market price and the strike price was less than 
the premium paid for the option, the net result of th e trade would still be a loss. In order for a call 
buyer to realize a net profit, the difference between the market price and the strike price would have 
to exceed the premium paid when  the call was purchased (after ad justing for commission cost). The 
higher the market price, the greater the resulting profit.

Chunk 4302 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
The buyer of a put seeks to profit from an anticipated  price decline by locking in a sales price. Like 
the call buyer, his maximum possible loss is limite d to the dollar amount of the premium paid for 
the option. In the case of a put held until expiration, the trade would show a net profit if the strike 
price exceeded the market price by an amount gr eater than the premium of the put at purchase 
(after adjusting for commission cost).

Chunk 4303 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
(after adjusting for commission cost). 
Whereas the buyer of a call or put has limited risk and unlimited potential gain, the reverse is true 
for the seller. The option seller (often called the writer) receives the dollar value of the premium in 
return for undertaking the obligation to assume an opposite position at the strike price if an option 
is exercised. For example, if a call is exercise d, the seller must assume a short position in the

Chunk 4304 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
underlying market at the strike price (since by ex ercising the call, the buyer assumes a long position 
at that price). 
The seller of a call seeks to profit from an anticip ated sideways to modes tly declining market. In 
such a situation, the premium earned by selling a call provides the most attractive trading 
opportunity. However, if the trader expected a large price decline, he would usually be better off

Chunk 4305 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
going short the underlying market or buying a put—trades with open- ended profit potential. In a 
similar fashion, the seller of a put seeks to profit from an anticipat ed sideways to modestly rising 
market. 
Some novices have trouble understandi ng why a trader would not always  prefer the b uy side of the 
option (call or put, depe nding on market opinion), since such  a trade has unlimited potential and

Chunk 4306 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
limited risk. Such confusion reflects the failur e to take probability into account. Although the 
option seller's theoretical risk is unlimited, the pri ce levels that have the greatest probability of 
occurrence (i.e., prices in the vi cinity of the market price when  the option trade occurs) would 
result in a net gain to the option seller. Roughly speaking, the option buyer accepts a large

Chunk 4307 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
probability of a small loss in return for a small pr obability of a large gain, whereas the option seller 
accepts a small probability of a large loss in excha nge for a large probability of a small gain. In an 
efficient market, neither the cons istent option buye r nor the consistent opti on seller shoul d have any 
significant advantage over the long run. 
The option premium consists of two component s: intrinsic value plus time value. The intrinsic

Chunk 4308 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
value of a call option is the amount by which the current market price is above th e strike price. (The 
intrinsic value of a put option is the amount by which the current  market price is below the strike 
price.) In effect, the intrinsic value is that part of the premium that could be realized if the option 
were exercised at the current market price. The intr insic value serves as a floor price for an option.

Chunk 4309 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
Why? Because if the premium were less than the intr insic value, a trader c ould buy and exercise the  215option and immediately offset the resulting market position, thereby realizing a net gain (assuming 
that the trader covers at  least transaction costs). 
Options that have intrinsic value (i.e., calls with strike prices below the ma rket price and puts with 
strike prices above the mark et price) are said to be in-the-money. Options that have no intrinsic

Chunk 4310 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
value are called out-of-the-money options. Options with a strike pric e closest to the market price are 
called at-the-money options. 
An out-of-the-money option, which by definition has an  intrinsic value equal to zero, will still have 
some value because of the possibility that the ma rket price will move beyond the strike price prior 
to the expiration date. An in-the-money option will have a value greater than the intrinsic value

Chunk 4311 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
because a position in the option will be prefer red to a position in the underlying market. Why? 
Because both the option and the mark et position will gain equally in the event of a favorable price 
movement, but the option's maximum loss is limite d. The portion of the premium that exceeds the 
intrinsic value is called the time value.  
The three most important factors that influence an option's time value are:

Chunk 4312 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
(I) Relationship between the strike and market price —Deeply out-of-the-money options will have 
little time value since it is unlikely that the mark et price will move to th e strike price—or beyond—
prior to expiration. Deeply in-the-money options have little time value, because these options offer 
positions very similarto the underlying market—both will gain and lose equivalent amounts for all 
but an extremely adverse price move. In other wo rds, for a deeply in-the-money option, the fact

Chunk 4313 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
that risk is limited is not worth very much, because the strike price is so far from the prevailing 
market price. 
(2) Time remaining until expiration —The more time remaining until  expiration, the greater the 
value of the option. This is true because a longer life span increases the pr obability of the intrinsic 
value increasing by any specified  amount prior to expiration. 
(3) Volatility —Time value will vary directly with the estimated volatility [a measure of the degree

Chunk 4314 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
of price variability] of the underlying market fo r the remaining life span of the option. This 
relationship is a result of the fact that greater vola tility raises the probability of the intrinsic value 
increasing by any specified amount prior to expirati on. In other words, the greater the volatility, the 
greater the probable pric e range of the market. 
Although volatility is an extremely important fact or in the determination of option premium values,

Chunk 4315 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
it should be stressed that the future volatility of  a market is never precisely known until after the 
fact. (In contrast, the time rema ining until expiration and the re lationship between the current 
market price and the strike price can be exactly specified at any juncture .) Thus, volatility must 
always be estimated on the basis of historical volatility data. The future volatility estimate implied

Chunk 4316 (Source: Market-Wizards-PDFdrive.com.co.txt):
by market prices (i.e., option premiums), which may be higher or lower than the historical 
volatility, is called the implied volatility.

Technical analysis

Chunk 4322 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Technical analysis
In finance, technical analysis is a security analysis discipline for forecasting the direction of prices through the
study of past market data, primarily price and volume.[1] Behavioral economics and quantitative analysis incorporate
substantial aspects of technical analysis,[2] which being an aspect of active management stands in contradiction to
much of modern portfolio theory. According to the weak-form efficient-market hypothesis, such forecasting methods

Chunk 4323 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
are valueless, since prices follow a random walk or are otherwise essentially unpredictable.
History
The principles of technical analysis derive from the observation of financial markets over hundreds of years.[3] The
oldest known hints of technical analysis appear in Joseph de la Vega's accounts of the Dutch markets in the 17th
century. In Asia, the oldest example of technical analysis is thought to be a method developed by Homma Munehisa

Chunk 4324 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
during early 18th century which evolved into the use of candlestick techniques, and is today a main charting tool.[4]
[5] In the 1920s and 1930s Richard W. Schabacker published several books which continued the work of Dow and
William Peter Hamilton in his books Stock Market Theory and Practice and Technical Market Analysis. At the end
of his life he was joined by his brother in law, Robert D. Edwards who finished his last book. In 1948 Edwards and

Chunk 4325 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
John Magee published Technical Analysis of Stock Trends which is widely considered to be one of the seminal
works of the discipline. It is exclusively concerned with trend analysis and chart patterns and remains in use to the
present. It is now in its 9th edition. As is obvious, early technical analysis was almost exclusively the analysis of
charts, because the processing power of computers was not available for statistical analysis. Charles Dow reportedly

Chunk 4326 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
originated a form of chart analysis used by technicians—point and figure analysis.
Dow Theory is based on the collected writings of Dow Jones co-founder and editor Charles Dow, and inspired the
use and development of modern technical analysis from the end of the 19th century. Other pioneers of analysis
techniques include Ralph Nelson Elliott, William Delbert Gann and Richard Wyckoff who developed their
respective techniques in the early 20th century.

respective techniques in the early 20th century.
Many more technical tools and theories have been developed and enhanced in recent decades, with an increasing
emphasis on computer-assisted techniques.
General description
While fundamental analysts examine earnings, dividends, new products, research and the like, technical analysts
examine what investors fear or think about those developments and whether or not investors have the wherewithal to

Chunk 4328 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
back up their opinions; these two concepts are called psych (psychology) and supply/demand. Technicians employ
many techniques, one of which is the use of charts. Using charts, technical analysts seek to identify price patterns
and market trends in financial markets and attempt to exploit those patterns.[6] Technicians use various methods and
tools, the study of price charts is but one.

Chunk 4329 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
tools, the study of price charts is but one.
Supply/demand indicators monitor investors' liquidity; margin levels, short interest, cash in brokerage accounts, etc.,
in an attempt to determine whether they have any money left. Other indicators monitor the state of psych - are
investors bullish or bearish? - and are they willing to spend money to back up their beliefs. A spent-out bull cannot

Chunk 4330 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
move the market higher, and a well heeled bear won't!; investors need to know which they are facing. In the end,
stock prices are only what investors think; therefore determining what they think is every bit as critical as an
earnings estimate.
Technicians using charts search for archetypal price chart patterns, such as the well-known head and shoulders or
double top/bottom reversal patterns, study technical indicators, moving averages, and look for forms such as lines of

Chunk 4331 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
support, resistance, channels, and more obscure formations such as flags, pennants, balance days and cup and handle
patterns.Technical analysis 2
Technical analysts also widely use market indicators of many sorts, some of which are mathematical transformations
of price, often including up and down volume, advance/decline data and other inputs. These indicators are used to
help access whether an asset is trending, and if it is, its probability of its direction and of continuation. Technicians

Chunk 4332 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
also look for relationships between price/volume indices and market indicators. Examples include the relative
strength index, and MACD. Other avenues of study include correlations between changes in options (implied
volatility) and put/call ratios with price. Also important are sentiment indicators such as Put/Call ratios, bull/bear
ratios, short interest and Implied Volatility, etc.
There are many techniques in technical analysis. Adherents of different techniques (for example, candlestick

Chunk 4333 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
charting, Dow Theory, and Elliott wave theory) may ignore the other approaches, yet many traders combine
elements from more than one technique. Some technical analysts use subjective judgment to decide which pattern(s)
a particular instrument reflects at a given time, and what the interpretation of that pattern should be. Others employ a
strictly mechanical or systematic approach to pattern identification and interpretation.

Chunk 4334 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Technical analysis is frequently contrasted with fundamental analysis, the study of economic factors that influence
the way investors price financial markets. Technical analysis holds that prices already reflect all such trends before
investors are aware of them. Uncovering those trends is what technical indicators are designed to do, imperfect as
they may be. Fundamental indicators are subject to the same limitations, naturally. Some traders use technical or

Chunk 4335 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
fundamental analysis exclusively, while others use both types to make trading decisions which conceivably is the
most rational approach.
Users of technical analysis are often called technicians or market technicians. Some prefer the term technical market
analyst or simply market analyst. An older term, chartist, is sometimes used, but as the discipline has expanded and
modernized, the use of the term chartist has become less popular, as it is only one aspect of technical analysis.

Chunk 4336 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Characteristics
Technical analysis employs models and trading rules based on price and volume transformations, such as the relative
strength index, moving averages, regressions, inter-market and intra-market price correlations, cycles or, classically,
through recognition of chart patterns.
Technical analysis stands in contrast to the fundamental analysis approach to security and stock analysis. Technical

Chunk 4337 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
analysis analyses price, volume and other market information, whereas fundamental analysis looks at the actual facts
of the company, market, currency or commodity. Most large brokerage, trading group, or financial institution will
typically have both a technical analysis and fundamental analysis team.
Technical analysis is widely used among traders and financial professionals, and is very often used by active day

Chunk 4338 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
traders, market makers, and pit traders. In the 1960s and 1970s it was widely dismissed by academics. In a recent
review, Irwin and Park[7] reported that 56 of 95 modern studies found it produces positive results, but noted that
many of the positive results were rendered dubious by issues such as data snooping so that the evidence in support of
technical analysis was inconclusive; it is still considered by many academics to be pseudoscience.[8] Academics such

Chunk 4339 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
as Eugene Fama say the evidence for technical analysis is sparse and is inconsistent with the weak form of the
efficient-market hypothesis.[9] [10] Users hold that even if technical analysis cannot predict the future, it helps to
identify trading opportunities.[11]
In the foreign exchange markets, its use may be more widespread than fundamental analysis.[12] [13] This does not
mean technical analysis is more applicable to foreign markets, but that technical analysis is more recognized there as

Chunk 4340 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
to its efficacy there than elsewhere. While some isolated studies have indicated that technical trading rules might
lead to consistent returns in the period prior to 1987,[14] [15] [16] [17] most academic work has focused on the nature of
the anomalous position of the foreign exchange market.[18] It is speculated that this anomaly is due to central bank
intervention, which obviously technical analysis is not designed to predict.[19] Recent research suggests that

Principles
Stock chart showing levels of support (4,5,6, 7,
and 8) and resistance (1, 2, and 3); levels of
resistance tend to become levels of support and
vice versa.
Technicians say that a market's price reflects all relevant information,
so their analysis looks at the history of a security's trading pattern

Chunk 4342 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
rather than external drivers such as economic, fundamental and news
events. Price action also tends to repeat itself because investors
collectively tend toward patterned behavior – hence technicians' focus
on identifiable trends and conditions.
Market action discounts everything
Based on the premise that all relevant information is already reflected
by prices, technical analysts believe it is important to understand what

Chunk 4343 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
investors think of that information, known and perceived; studies such as by Cutler, Poterba, and Summers titled
"What Moves Stock Prices?" do not cover this aspect of investing.
Prices move in trends
Technical analysts believe that prices trend directionally, i.e., up, down, or sideways (flat) or some combination. The
basic definition of a price trend was originally put forward by Dow Theory.[6]

Chunk 4344 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
An example of a security that had an apparent trend is AOL from November 2001 through August 2002. A technical
analyst or trend follower recognizing this trend would look for opportunities to sell this security. AOL consistently
moves downward in price. Each time the stock rose, sellers would enter the market and sell the stock; hence the
"zig-zag" movement in the price. The series of "lower highs" and "lower lows" is a tell tale sign of a stock in a down

Chunk 4345 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
trend.[21] In other words, each time the stock moved lower, it fell below its previous relative low price. Each time the
stock moved higher, it could not reach the level of its previous relative high price.
Note that the sequence of lower lows and lower highs did not begin until August. Then AOL makes a low price that
doesn't pierce the relative low set earlier in the month. Later in the same month, the stock makes a relative high equal

Chunk 4346 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
to the most recent relative high. In this a technician sees strong indications that the down trend is at least pausing and
possibly ending, and would likely stop actively selling the stock at that point.
History tends to repeat itself
Technical analysts believe that investors collectively repeat the behavior of the investors that preceded them.
"Everyone wants in on the next Microsoft," "If this stock ever gets to $50 again, I will buy it," "This company's

Chunk 4347 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
technology will revolutionize its industry, therefore this stock will skyrocket" – these are all examples of investor
sentiment repeating itself. To a technician, the emotions in the market may be irrational, but they exist. Because
investor behavior repeats itself so often, technicians believe that recognizable (and predictable) price patterns will
develop on a chart.[6]
Technical analysis is not limited to charting, but it always considers price trends. For example, many technicians

Chunk 4348 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
monitor surveys of investor sentiment. These surveys gauge the attitude of market participants, specifically whether
they are bearish or bullish. Technicians use these surveys to help determine whether a trend will continue or if a
reversal could develop; they are most likely to anticipate a change when the surveys report extreme investor
sentiment. Surveys that show overwhelming bullishness, for example, are evidence that an uptrend may reverse – the

Chunk 4349 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
premise being that if most investors are bullish they have already bought the market (anticipating higher prices). And
because most investors are bullish and invested, one assumes that few buyers remain. This leaves more potential
sellers than buyers, despite the bullish sentiment. This suggests that prices will trend down, and is an example of
contrarian trading.Technical analysis 4

Technical Analysis. A body of knowledge is central to the field as a way of defining how and why technical analysis

Traders generally share the view that trading in the direction of the trend is the most effective means to be profitable
in financial or commodities markets. John W. Henry, Larry Hite, Ed Seykota, Richard Dennis, William Eckhardt,
Victor Sperandeo, Michael Marcus and Paul Tudor Jones (some of the so-called wizards in the popular book, Market
Wizards by Jack D. Schwager) have each amassed massive fortunes via the use of technical analysis and its

concepts. George Lane, a technical analyst, coined one of the most popular phrases on Wall Street, "The trend is
your friend!"
Many non-arbitrage algorithmic trading systems rely on the idea of trend-following, as do many hedge funds. A
relatively recent trend, both in research and industrial practice, has been the development of increasingly
sophisticated automated trading strategies. These often rely on underlying technical analysis principles (see

Chunk 4355 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):

Systematic trading
Neural networks
Since the early 1990s when the first practically usable types emerged, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have rapidly
grown in popularity. They are artificial intelligence adaptive software systems that have been inspired by how
biological neural networks work. They are used because they can learn to detect complex patterns in data. In

Chunk 4356 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
mathematical terms, they are universal function approximators,[22] [23] meaning that given the right data and
configured correctly, they can capture and model any input-output relationships. This not only removes the need for
human interpretation of charts or the series of rules for generating entry/exit signals, but also provides a bridge to
fundamental analysis, as the variables used in fundamental analysis can be used as input.

Chunk 4357 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
As ANNs are essentially non-linear statistical models, their accuracy and prediction capabilities can be both
mathematically and empirically tested. In various studies, authors have claimed that neural networks used for
generating trading signals given various technical and fundamental inputs have significantly outperformed buy-hold
strategies as well as traditional linear technical analysis methods when combined with rule-based expert systems.[24]
[25] [26]

Chunk 4358 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
[25] [26]
While the advanced mathematical nature of such adaptive systems has kept neural networks for financial analysis
mostly within academic research circles, in recent years more user friendly neural network software has made the
technology more accessible to traders. However, large-scale application is problematic because of the problem of
matching the correct neural topology to the market being studied.Technical analysis 5
Rule-based trading

Chunk 4359 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Rule-based trading
Rule-based trading is an approach intended to create trading plans using strict and clear-cut rules. Unlike some other
technical methods and the approach of fundamental analysis, it defines a set of rules that determine all trades,
leaving minimal discretion. The theory behind this approach is that by following a distinct set of trading rules you
will reduce the number of poor decisions, which are often emotion based.

Chunk 4360 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
For instance, a trader might make a set of rules stating that he will take a long position whenever the price of a
particular instrument closes above its 50-day moving average, and shorting it whenever it drops below.
Combination with other market forecast methods
John Murphy states that the principal sources of information available to technicians are price, volume and open
interest.[27] Other data, such as indicators and sentiment analysis, are considered secondary.

Chunk 4361 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
However, many technical analysts reach outside pure technical analysis, combining other market forecast methods
with their technical work. One advocate for this approach is John Bollinger, who coined the term rational analysis in
the middle 1980s for the intersection of technical analysis and fundamental analysis.[28] Another such approach,
fusion analysis,[29] overlays fundamental analysis with technical, in an attempt to improve portfolio manager
performance.

Chunk 4362 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
performance.
Technical analysis is also often combined with quantitative analysis and economics. For example, neural networks
may be used to help identify intermarket relationships.[30] A few market forecasters combine financial astrology with
technical analysis. Chris Carolan's article "Autumn Panics and Calendar Phenomenon", which won the Market
Technicians Association Dow Award for best technical analysis paper in 1998, demonstrates how technical analysis

Chunk 4363 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
and lunar cycles can be combined.[31] Calendar phenomena, such as the January effect in the stock market, are
generally believed to be caused by tax and accounting related transactions, and are not related to the subject of
financial astrology.
Investor and newsletter polls, and magazine cover sentiment indicators, are also used by technical analysts.[32]
Empirical evidence
Whether technical analysis actually works is a matter of controversy. Methods vary greatly, and different technical

Chunk 4364 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
analysts can sometimes make contradictory predictions from the same data. Many investors claim that they
experience positive returns, but academic appraisals often find that it has little predictive power.[33] Modern studies
may be more positive: of 95 modern studies, 56 concluded that technical analysis had positive results, although
data-snooping bias and other problems make the analysis difficult.[7] Nonlinear prediction using neural networks

Chunk 4365 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
occasionally produces statistically significant prediction results.[34] A Federal Reserve working paper[15] regarding
support and resistance levels in short-term foreign exchange rates "offers strong evidence that the levels help to
predict intraday trend interruptions," although the "predictive power" of those levels was "found to vary across the
exchange rates and firms examined".
Technical trading strategies were found to be effective in the Chinese marketplace by a recent study that states,

Chunk 4366 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
"Finally, we find significant positive returns on buy trades generated by the contrarian version of the moving average
crossover rule, the channel breakout rule, and the Bollinger band trading rule, after accounting for transaction costs
of 0.50 percent."[35]
An influential 1992 study by Brock et al. which appeared to find support for technical trading rules was tested for
data snooping and other problems in 1999;[36] the sample covered by Brock et al. was robust to data snooping.

Chunk 4367 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Subsequently, a comprehensive study of the question by Amsterdam economist Gerwin Griffioen concludes that: 
"for the U.S., Japanese and most Western European stock market indices the recursive out-of-sample forecasting 
procedure does not show to be profitable, after implementing little transaction costs. Moreover, for sufficiently highTechnical analysis 6
transaction costs it is found, by estimating CAPMs, that technical trading shows no statistically significant

Chunk 4368 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
risk-corrected out-of-sample forecasting power for almost all of the stock market indices."[10] Transaction costs are
particularly applicable to "momentum strategies"; a comprehensive 1996 review of the data and studies concluded
that even small transaction costs would lead to an inability to capture any excess from such strategies.[37]
In a paper published in the Journal of Finance, Dr. Andrew W. Lo, director MIT Laboratory for Financial

Chunk 4369 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Engineering, working with Harry Mamaysky and Jiang Wang found that "Technical analysis, also known as

obstacles is the highly subjective nature of technical analysis—the presence of geometric shapes in historical price

Chunk 4370 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
charts is often in the eyes of the beholder. In this paper, we propose a systematic and automatic approach to technical
pattern recognition using nonparametric kernel regression, and apply this method to a large number of U.S. stocks
from 1962 to 1996 to evaluate the effectiveness of technical analysis. By comparing the unconditional empirical
distribution of daily stock returns to the conditional distribution—conditioned on specific technical indicators such

Chunk 4371 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
as head-and-shoulders or double-bottoms—we find that over the 31-year sample period, several technical indicators
do provide incremental information and may have some practical value."[38] In that same paper Dr. Lo wrote that
"several academic studies suggest that ... technical analysis may well be an effective means for extracting useful
information from market prices."[39] Some techniques such as Drummond Geometry attempt to overcome the past

Chunk 4372 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
data bias by projecting support and resistance levels from differing time frames into the near-term future and
combining that with reversion to the mean techniques.[40]
Efficient market hypothesis
The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) contradicts the basic tenets of technical analysis by stating that past prices
cannot be used to profitably predict future prices. Thus it holds that technical analysis cannot be effective. Economist

Chunk 4373 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Eugene Fama published the seminal paper on the EMH in the Journal of Finance in 1970, and said "In short, the
evidence in support of the efficient markets model is extensive, and (somewhat uniquely in economics) contradictory
evidence is sparse."[41] EMH advocates say that if prices quickly reflect all relevant information, no method
(including technical analysis) can "beat the market." Developments which influence prices occur randomly and are
unknowable in advance.

Chunk 4374 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
unknowable in advance.
Technicians say that EMH ignores the way markets work, in that many investors base their expectations on past
earnings or track record, for example. Because future stock prices can be strongly influenced by investor
expectations, technicians claim it only follows that past prices influence future prices.[42] They also point to research
in the field of behavioral finance, specifically that people are not the rational participants EMH makes them out to

Chunk 4375 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
be. Technicians have long said that irrational human behavior influences stock prices, and that this behavior leads to
predictable outcomes.[43] Author David Aronson says that the theory of behavioral finance blends with the practice
of technical analysis:
By considering the impact of emotions, cognitive errors, irrational preferences, and the dynamics of
group behavior, behavioral finance offers succinct explanations of excess market volatility as well as the

Chunk 4376 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
excess returns earned by stale information strategies.... cognitive errors may also explain the existence
of market inefficiencies that spawn the systematic price movements that allow objective TA [technical
analysis] methods to work.[42]
EMH advocates reply that while individual market participants do not always act rationally (or have complete
information), their aggregate decisions balance each other, resulting in a rational outcome (optimists who buy stock

Chunk 4377 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
and bid the price higher are countered by pessimists who sell their stock, which keeps the price in equilibrium).[44]
Likewise, complete information is reflected in the price because all market participants bring their own individual,
but incomplete, knowledge together in the market.[44]Technical analysis 7
Random walk hypothesis
The random walk hypothesis may be derived from the weak-form efficient markets hypothesis, which is based on the

Chunk 4378 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
assumption that market participants take full account of any information contained in past price movements (but not
necessarily other public information). In his book A Random Walk Down Wall Street, Princeton economist Burton
Malkiel said that technical forecasting tools such as pattern analysis must ultimately be self-defeating: "The problem
is that once such a regularity is known to market participants, people will act in such a way that prevents it from
happening in the future."[45]

Chunk 4379 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
happening in the future."[45]
In the late 1980s, professors Andrew Lo and Craig McKinlay published a paper which casts doubt on the random
walk hypothesis. In a 1999 response to Malkiel, Lo and McKinlay collected empirical papers that questioned the
hypothesis' applicability[46] that suggested a non-random and possibly predictive component to stock price
movement, though they were careful to point out that rejecting random walk does not necessarily invalidate EMH, an

Chunk 4380 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
entirely separate concept from RWH.
Technicians say that the EMH and random walk theories both ignore the realities of markets, in that participants are
not completely rational and that current price moves are not independent of previous moves.[21] [47]

CONCEPTS
Support and resistance
Support and resistance is a concept in technical analysis that the movement of the price of a security will tend to
stop and reverse at certain predetermined price levels.
Support

Chunk 4411 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Support
A support level is a price level where the price tends to find support as it is going down. This means the price is
more likely to "bounce" off this level rather than break through it. However, once the price has passed this level, by
an amount exceeding some noise, it is likely to continue dropping until it finds another support level.
Resistance
A resistance level is the opposite of a support level. It is where the price tends to find resistance as it is going up.

Chunk 4412 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
This means the price is more likely to "bounce" off this level rather than break through it. However, once the price
has passed this level, by an amount exceeding some noise, it is likely that it will continue rising until it finds another
resistance level.
Reactive vs Proactive support and resistance
Most Traders will be aware of the many different types of Support and Resistance methods used by traders

Chunk 4413 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Proactive Support and Resistance methods are ‘predictive’ they often outline areas where price has not actually been.
They are formed based upon current price action that through analysis has been shown to be predictive of future
price action. Proactive Support and Resistance methods include Elliot Wave, Fibonacci, Calculated Pivots,
Trendlines and Moving averages. VWAP, Market Profile (VAH, VAL and POC)

Chunk 4414 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Reactive Support and Resistance are the opposite they are formed directly as a result of price action or volume
behaviour. They include Volume Profile, Price Swing lows/highs, Initial Balance, Open Gaps and OHLC.
Both Proactive and Reactive Support and Resistance methods have merit and form a staple part of any Support and
Resistance based trading strategy
Identifying support and resistance levels

Chunk 4415 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Identifying support and resistance levels
Support and resistance levels can be identified by trend lines. Some traders believe in using pivot point calculations.
The more often a support/resistance level is "tested" (touched and bounced off by price), the more significance given
to that specific level.
If a price breaks past a support level, that support level often becomes a new resistance level. The opposite is true as

Chunk 4416 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
well, if price breaks a resistance level, it will often find support at that level in the future.
Various methods of determining support and resistance exist. A price histogram is useful in showing at what price a
market has spent more relative time. Psychological levels near round numbers often serve as support and resistance.
More recently, volatility has been used to calculate potential support and resistance.Support and resistance 12
Using support and resistance levels

Chunk 4417 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Using support and resistance levels
This is an example of support switching roles with resistance, and vice versa:
If a stock price is moving between support and resistance levels, then a basic investment strategy commonly used by
traders, is to buy a stock at support and sell at resistance, then short at resistance and cover the short at support as per
the following example:Support and resistance 13

Chunk 4418 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
the following example:Support and resistance 13
When judging entry and exit investment timing using support or resistance levels it is important to choose a chart
based on a price interval period that aligns with your trading strategy timeframe. Short term traders tend to use charts
based on interval periods, such as 1 minute (i.e. the price of the security is plotted on the chart every 1 minute), with

Chunk 4419 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
longer term traders using price charts based on hourly, daily, weekly or monthly interval periods. Typically traders
use shorter term interval charts when making a final decisions on when to invest, such as the following example
based on 1 week of historical data with price plotted every 15 minutes. In this example the early signs that the stock
was coming out of a downtrend was when it started to form support at $30.48 and then started to form higher highs

A trend line is a bounding line for the price movement of a security. A support trend line is formed when a
securities price decreases and then rebounds at a pivot point that aligns with at least two previous support pivot
points. Similarly a resistance trend line is formed when a securities price increases and then rebounds at a pivot
point that aligns with at least two previous resistance pivot points. The following chart provides an example of

percentage changes than pure numerical value. If we were to view this same chart linearly, we would not be able to

price charts, however they can also be

lines can be used to identify positive
and negative trending charts, whereby
a positive trending chart forms an

downsloping line when the support and resistance pivot points are aligned.
Trend lines are used in many ways by traders. If a stock price is moving between support and resistance trend lines,

short at resistance and cover the short at support. The logic behind this, is that when the price returns to an existing
principal trend line it may be an opportunity to open new positions in the direction of the trend, in the belief that the

Chunk 4428 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
trend line will hold and the trend will continue further. A second way is that when price action breaks through the
principal trend line of an existing trend, it is evidence that the trend may be going to fail, and a trader may consider
trading in the opposite direction to the existing trend, or exiting positions in the direction of the trend.

Breakout (technical analysis)
A breakout is when prices pass through and stay through an area of support or resistance. On the technical analysis
chart a break out occurs when price of a stock or commodity exits an area pattern.
Market trend
Statues of the two symbolic beasts of finance, the bear and the bull,
in front of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
A market trend is a putative tendency of a financial
market to move in a particular direction over time.[1]

Chunk 4430 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
These trends are classified as secular for long time
frames, primary for medium time frames, and
secondary lasting short times.[2] Traders identify
market trends using technical analysis, a framework
which characterizes market trends as a predictable price
response of the market at levels of price support and
price resistance, varying over time.
The terms bull market and bear market describe upward
and downward market trends, respectively, and can be

Chunk 4431 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
used to describe either the market as a whole or specific
sectors and securities.[3]
Secular market trend
A secular market trend is a long-term trend that lasts 5 to 25 years and consists of a series of sequential primary
trends. A secular bear market consists of smaller bull markets and larger bear markets; a secular bull market consists
of larger bull markets and smaller bear markets.

Chunk 4432 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
of larger bull markets and smaller bear markets.
In a secular bull market the prevailing trend is "bullish" or upward moving. The United States stock market was
described as being in a secular bull market from about 1983 to 2000 (or 2007), with brief upsets including the crash
of 1987 and the dot-com bust of 2000–2002.
In a secular bear market, the prevailing trend is "bearish" or downward moving. An example of a secular bear market

Secondary market trend
Secondary trends are short-term changes in price direction within a primary trend. The duration is a few weeks or a
few months.

Chunk 4434 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
few months.
One type of secondary market trend is called a market correction. A correction is a short term price decline of 5% to
20% or so.[5] A correction is a downward movement that is not large enough to be a bear market (ex post).
Another type of secondary trend is called a bear market rally (or "sucker's rally") which consist of a market price
increase of 10% to 20%. A bear market rally is an upward movement that is not large enough to be a bull market (ex

Chunk 4435 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
post). Bear market rallies occurred in the Dow Jones index after the 1929 stock market crash leading down to the
market bottom in 1932, and throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. The Japanese Nikkei 225 has been typified
by a number of bear market rallies since the late 1980s while experiencing an overall long-term downward trend.
Primary market trend
A primary trend has broad support throughout the entire market (most sectors) and lasts for a year or more.
Bull market

Chunk 4436 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Bull market
A bull market is associated with increasing investor confidence, and increased investing in anticipation of future
price increases (capital gains). A bullish trend in the stock market often begins before the general economy shows
clear signs of recovery. It is a win-win situation for the investors.
Examples
India's Bombay Stock Exchange Index, SENSEX, was in a bull market trend for about five years from April 2003 to

Chunk 4437 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
January 2008 as it increased from 2,900 points to 21,000 points. A notable bull market was in the 1990s and most of
the 1980s when the U.S. and many other stock markets rose; the end of this time period sees the dot-com bubble.
Bear market
A bear market is a general decline in the stock market over a period of time.[6] It is a transition from high investor
optimism to widespread investor fear and pessimism. According to The Vanguard Group, "While there’s no

Chunk 4438 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
agreed-upon definition of a bear market, one generally accepted measure is a price decline of 20% or more over at
least a two-month period."[7] It is sometimes referred to as "The Heifer Market" due to the paradox with the above
subject.
Examples
A bear market followed the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and erased 89% (from 386 to 40) of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average's market capitalization by July 1932, marking the start of the Great Depression. After regaining nearly 50%

Chunk 4439 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
of its losses, a longer bear market from 1937 to 1942 occurred in which the market was again cut in half. Another
long-term bear market occurred from about 1973 to 1982, encompassing the 1970s energy crisis and the high
unemployment of the early 1980s. Yet another bear market occurred between March 2000 and October 2002. The
most recent example occurred between October 2007 and March 2009.Market trend 18
Market top

Chunk 4440 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Market top
A market top (or market high) is usually not a dramatic event. The market has simply reached the highest point that
it will, for some time (usually a few years). It is retroactively defined as market participants are not aware of it as it
happens. A decline then follows, usually gradually at first and later with more rapidity. William J. O'Neil and
company report that since the 1950s a market top is characterized by three to five distribution days in a major market

Chunk 4441 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
index occurring within a relatively short period of time. Distribution is a decline in price with higher volume than the
preceding session.
Examples
The peak of the dot-com bubble (as measured by the NASDAQ-100) occurred on March 24, 2000. The index closed
at 4,704.73 and has not since returned to that level. The Nasdaq peaked at 5,132.50 and the S&P 500 at 1525.20.
A recent peak for the broad U.S. market was October 9, 2007. The S&P 500 index closed at 1,576 and the Nasdaq at
2861.50.

Chunk 4442 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
2861.50.
Market bottom
A market bottom is a trend reversal, the end of a market downturn, and precedes the beginning of an upward moving
trend (bull market).
It is very difficult to identify a bottom (referred to by investors as "bottom picking") while it is occurring. The upturn
following a decline is often short-lived and prices might resume their decline. This would bring a loss for the
investor who purchased stock(s) during a misperceived or "false" market bottom.

Chunk 4443 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Baron Rothschild is said to have advised that the best time to buy is when there is "blood in the streets", i.e., when
the markets have fallen drastically and investor sentiment is extremely negative.[8]
Examples
Some examples of market bottoms, in terms of the closing values of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
include:
•The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a bottom at 1738.74 on 19 October 1987, as a result of the decline from

Chunk 4444 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
2722.41 on 25 August 1987. This day was called Black Monday (chart[9] ).
•A bottom of 7286.27 was reached on the DJIA on 9 October 2002 as a result of the decline from 11722.98 on 14
January 2000. This included an intermediate bottom of 8235.81 on 21 September 2001 (a 14% change from 10
September) which led to an intermediate top of 10635.25 on 19 March 2002 (chart[10] ). The "tech-heavy" Nasdaq
fell a more precipitous 79% from its 5132 peak (10 March 2000) to its 1108 bottom (10 October 2002).

Chunk 4445 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
•A decline associated with the subprime mortgage crisis starting at 14164.41 on 9 October 2007 (DJIA) and caused
a bottom of 6,440.08 on 9 March 2009 (chart[11] ).
Investor sentiment
Investor sentiment is a contrarian stock market indicator.
By definition, the market balances buyers and sellers, so it's impossible to literally have 'more buyers than sellers' or
vice versa, although that is a common expression. The market comprises investors and traders. The investors may

Chunk 4446 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
own a stock for many years; traders put on a position for several weeks down to seconds.
Generally, the investors follow a buy low sell high strategy.[12] Traders attempt to "fade" the investors' actions (buy
when they are selling, sell when they are buying). A surge in demand from investors lifts the traders' asks, while a
surge in supply hits the traders' bids.
When a high proportion of investors express a bearish (negative) sentiment, some analysts consider it to be a strong

Chunk 4447 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
signal that a market bottom may be near. The predictive capability of such a signal (see also market sentiment) isMarket trend 19
thought to be highest when investor sentiment reaches extreme values.[13] Indicators that measure investor sentiment
may include:
•Investor Intelligence Sentiment Index: If the Bull-Bear spread (% of Bulls - % of Bears) is close to a historic low,
it may signal a bottom. Typically, the number of bears surveyed would exceed the number of bulls. However, if

Chunk 4448 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
the number of bulls is at an extreme high and the number of bears is at an extreme low, historically, a market top
may have occurred or is close to occurring. This contrarian measure is more reliable for its coincidental timing at
market lows than tops.
•American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) sentiment indicator: Many feel that the majority of the
decline has already occurred once this indicator gives a reading of minus 15% or below.

Chunk 4449 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
•Other sentiment indicators include the Nova-Ursa ratio, the Short Interest/Total Market Float, and the Put/Call
ratio.
Market capitulation
Market capitulation refers to the threshold reached after a severe fall in the market, when large numbers of investors
can no longer tolerate the financial losses incurred.[14] These investors then capitulate (give up) and sell in panic, or

Chunk 4450 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
find that their pre-set sell stops have been triggered, thereby automatically liquidating their holdings in a given stock.
This may trigger a further decline in the stock's price, if not already anticipated by the market. Margin calls and
mutual fund and hedge fund redemptions significantly contribute to capitulations.
The contrarians consider a capitulation a sign of a possible bottom in prices. This is because almost everyone who

Chunk 4451 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
wanted (or was forced) to sell stock has already done so, leaving the buyers in the market, and they are expected to
drive the prices up.
The peak in volume may precede an actual bottom.
Changes with consumer behavior
Market trends are fluctuated on the demographics and technology. In a micro economical view, the current state of
consumer trust in spending will vary the circulation of currency. In a micro economical view, demographics within a

Chunk 4452 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
market will change the advancement of businesses and companies. With the introduction of the internet, consumers
have access to different vendors as well as substitute products and services changing the direction of which a market
will go.
Despite that it is believed that market trends follow one direction over a matter of time, there are many different
factors that change can change this idea. Technology s-curves, explained in the book The Innovator's Dilemma,

Chunk 4453 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
states that technology will start slow then increase in users once better understood but level off once another
technology replaces it, proving that change in the market is actually consistent.
Etymology
The precise origin of the phrases "bull market" and "bear market" are obscure. The Oxford English Dictionary cites
an 1891 use of the term "bull market". In French "bulle spéculative" refers to a speculative market bubble. The

Chunk 4454 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Online Etymology Dictionary relates the word "bull" to "inflate, swell", and dates its stock market connotation to
1714.[15]
One hypothetical etymology points to London bearskin "jobbers" (market makers), who would sell bearskins before
the bears had actually been caught in contradiction of the proverb ne vendez pas la peau de l'ours avant de l’avoir tué
("don't sell the bearskin before you've killed the bear")—an admonition against over-optimism. By the time of the

Chunk 4455 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
South Sea Bubble of 1721, the bear was also associated with short selling; jobbers would sell bearskins they did not
own in anticipation of falling prices, which would enable them to buy them later for an additional profit.Market trend 20
Another plausible origin is from the word "bulla" which means bill, or contract. When a market is rising, holders of
contracts for future delivery of a commodity see the value of their contract increase. However in a falling market, the

Chunk 4456 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
counterparties—the "bearers" of the commodity to be delivered—win because they have locked in a future delivery
price that is higher than the current price.
Some analogies that have been used as mnemonic devices:
•Bull is short for 'bully', in its now mostly obsolete meaning of 'excellent'.
•It relates to the common use of these animals in blood sport, i.e. bear-baiting and bull-baiting.

Chunk 4457 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
•It refers to the way that the animals attack: a bull attacks upwards with its horns, while a bear swipes downwards
with its paws.
•It relates to the speed of the animals: bulls usually charge at very high speed whereas bears normally are thought
of as lazy and cautious movers—a misconception because a bear, under the right conditions, can outrun a
horse.[16]
•They were originally used in reference to two old merchant banking families, the Barings and the Bulstrodes.

Chunk 4458 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
•Bears hibernate, while bulls do not.
•The word "bull" plays off the market's returns being "full" whereas "bear" alludes to the market's returns being
"bare".
In describing financial market behavior, the largest group of market participants is often referred to, metaphorically,
as the herd. This is especially relevant to participants in bull markets since bulls are herding animals. A bull market

Chunk 4459 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
is also sometimes described as a bull run. Dow Theory attempts to describe the character of these market
movements.[17]
International sculpture team Mark and Diane Weisbeck were chosen to re-design Wall Street's Bull Market. Their
winning sculpture, the "Bull Market Rocket" was chosen as the modern, 21st century symbol of the up-trending Bull
Market.
Criticism

Dead cat bounce
Dead cat bounce is a Wall Street term that refers to a small, brief recovery in the price of a declining stock.[1]
History
The term "dead cat bounce" is derived from the idea that "even a dead cat will bounce if it falls from a great

Chunk 4468 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
height".[2] The phrase has been used on Wall Street for many years. The earliest use of the phrase dates from 1985
when the Singaporean and Malaysian stock markets bounced back after a hard fall during the recession of that year.
Journalist Christopher Sherwell of the Financial Times reported a stock broker as saying the market rise was a "dead
cat bounce". A similar expression has an older history in Cantonese and this may be the origin of the term.
Variations and usage

Chunk 4469 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Variations and usage
A short rise in price followed by a price decline of a stock is the standard usage of the term. In other instances the
term is used exclusively to refer to securities or stocks that are considered to be of low value. First, the securities
have poor past performance. Second, there is no indication of an impending rise in price. Lastly, there is no
indication that sustained growth is imminent should a major upward shift occur in the market.[2]

Chunk 4470 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Some variations on the definition of the term include:
•A stock in a severe decline has a sharp bounce off the lows.[3]
•A small upward price movement in a bear market after which the market continues to fall.[4] [5] [6]
Technical analysis
A "dead cat bounce" price pattern may be considered part of the technical analysis method of stock trading. Price
patterns such as the dead cat bounce are recognized only with hindsight. Technical analysis describes a dead cat

Chunk 4471 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
bounce as a continuation pattern that looks in the beginning like a reversal pattern. It begins with a downward move
followed by a significant price retracement. The price fails to continue upward and instead falls again downwards,
and exceeds the prior low.[7]Dead cat bounce 22
Alternate meanings
The term has also been used in reference to political polling numbers.[8]

The Elliott Wave Principle is a form of technical analysis that traders use to analyze financial market cycles and
forecast market trends by identifying extremes in investor psychology, highs and lows in prices, and other collective
factors. Ralph Nelson Elliott (1871–1948), a professional accountant, discovered the underlying social principles and

Chunk 4475 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
developed the analytical tools in the 1930s. He proposed that market prices unfold in specific patterns, which
practitioners today call Elliott waves, or simply waves. Elliott published his theory of market behavior in the book
The Wave Principle in 1938, summarized it in a series of articles in Financial World magazine in 1939, and covered
it most comprehensively in his final major work, Nature’s Laws: The Secret of the Universe in 1946. Elliott stated

Chunk 4476 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
that "because man is subject to rhythmical procedure, calculations having to do with his activities can be projected
far into the future with a justification and certainty heretofore unattainable."[1]Elliott wave principle 23
Overall design
From R.N. Elliott's essay, "The Basis of the Wave Principle,"
October 1940.
The Elliot Wave Principle posits that collective
investor psychology, or crowd psychology, moves
between optimism and pessimism in natural sequences.

Chunk 4477 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
These mood swings create patterns evidenced in the
price movements of markets at every degree of trend or
time scale.
In Elliott's model, market prices alternate between an
impulsive, or motive phase, and a corrective phase on
all time scales of trend, as the illustration shows.
Impulses are always subdivided into a set of 5
lower-degree waves, alternating again between motive
and corrective character, so that waves 1, 3, and 5 are
impulses, and waves 2 and 4 are smaller retraces of

Chunk 4478 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
waves 1 and 3. Corrective waves subdivide into 3
smaller-degree waves starting with a five-wave
counter-trend impulse, a retrace, and another impulse. In a bear market the dominant trend is downward, so the
pattern is reversed—five waves down and three up. Motive waves always move with the trend, while corrective
waves move against it.
Degree
The patterns link to form five and three-wave structures which themselves underlie self-similar wave structures of

Chunk 4479 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
increasing size or higher degree. Note the lower most of the three idealized cycles. In the first small five-wave
sequence, waves 1, 3 and 5 are motive, while waves 2 and 4 are corrective. This signals that the movement of the
wave one degree higher is upward. It also signals the start of the first small three-wave corrective sequence. After the
initial five waves up and three waves down, the sequence begins again and the self-similar fractal geometry begins to

Chunk 4480 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
unfold according to the five and three-wave structure which it underlies one degree higher. The completed motive
pattern includes 89 waves, followed by a completed corrective pattern of 55 waves.[2]
Each degree of a pattern in a financial market has a name. Practitioners use symbols for each wave to indicate both
function and degree—numbers for motive waves, letters for corrective waves (shown in the highest of the three

Chunk 4481 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
idealized series of wave structures or degrees). Degrees are relative; they are defined by form, not by absolute size or
duration. Waves of the same degree may be of very different size and/or duration.[2]
The classification of a wave at any particular degree can vary, though practitioners generally agree on the standard
order of degrees (approximate durations given):
•Grand supercycle: multi-century
•Supercycle: multi-decade (about 40-70 years)

Chunk 4482 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
•Supercycle: multi-decade (about 40-70 years)
•Cycle: one year to several years (or even several decades under an Elliott Extension)
•Primary: a few months to a couple of years
•Intermediate: weeks to months
•Minor: weeks
•Minute: days
•Minuette: hours
•Subminuette: minutesElliott wave principle 24
Elliott Wave personality and characteristics
Elliott wave analysts (or Elliotticians) hold that each individual wave has its own signature or characteristic, which

Chunk 4483 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
typically reflects the psychology of the moment.[2] [3] Understanding those personalities is key to the application of
the Wave Principle; they are defined below. (Definitions assume a bull market in equities; the characteristics apply
in reverse in bear markets.)
 Five wave pattern (dominant trend)  Three wave pattern (corrective trend) 
Wave 1: Wave one is rarely obvious at its inception. When the first wave of a new
bull market begins, the fundamental news is almost universally negative. The

Chunk 4484 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
previous trend is considered still strongly in force. Fundamental analysts continue to
revise their earnings estimates lower; the economy probably does not look strong.
Sentiment surveys are decidedly bearish, put options are in vogue, and implied
volatility in the options market is high. Volume might increase a bit as prices rise,
but not by enough to alert many technical analysts.Wave A: Corrections are typically harder to identify than

Chunk 4485 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
impulse moves. In wave A of a bear market, the fundamental
news is usually still positive. Most analysts see the drop as a
correction in a still-active bull market. Some technical
indicators that accompany wave A include increased
volume, rising implied volatility in the options markets and
possibly a turn higher in open interest in related futures
markets.
Wave 2: Wave two corrects wave one, but can never extend beyond the starting

Chunk 4486 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
point of wave one. Typically, the news is still bad. As prices retest the prior low,
bearish sentiment quickly builds, and "the crowd" haughtily reminds all that the bear
market is still deeply ensconced. Still, some positive signs appear for those who are
looking: volume should be lower during wave two than during wave one, prices
usually do not retrace more than 61.8% (see Fibonacci section below) of the wave

Chunk 4487 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
one gains, and prices should fall in a three wave pattern.Wave B: Prices reverse higher, which many see as a
resumption of the now long-gone bull market. Those
familiar with classical technical analysis may see the peak as
the right shoulder of a head and shoulders reversal pattern.
The volume during wave B should be lower than in wave A.
By this point, fundamentals are probably no longer
improving, but they most likely have not yet turned
negative.

negative.
Wave 3: Wave three is usually the largest and most powerful wave in a trend
(although some research suggests that in commodity markets, wave five is the
largest). The news is now positive and fundamental analysts start to raise earnings
estimates. Prices rise quickly, corrections are short-lived and shallow. Anyone
looking to "get in on a pullback" will likely miss the boat. As wave three starts, the
news is probably still bearish, and most market players remain negative; but by wave

three's midpoint, "the crowd" will often join the new bullish trend. Wave three often
extends wave one by a ratio of 1.618:1.Wave C: Prices move impulsively lower in five waves.
Volume picks up, and by the third leg of wave C, almost
everyone realizes that a bear market is firmly entrenched.
Wave C is typically at least as large as wave A and often
extends to 1.618 times wave A or beyond.
Wave 4: Wave four is typically clearly corrective. Prices may meander sideways for

an extended period, and wave four typically retraces less than 38.2% of wave three
(see Fibonacci relationships below). Volume is well below than that of wave three.
This is a good place to buy a pull back if you understand the potential ahead for wave
5. Still, fourth waves are often frustrating because of their lack of progress in the
larger trend.
Wave 5: Wave five is the final leg in the direction of the dominant trend. The news

Chunk 4491 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
is almost universally positive and everyone is bullish. Unfortunately, this is when
many average investors finally buy in, right before the top. Volume is often lower in
wave five than in wave three, and many momentum indicators start to show
divergences (prices reach a new high but the indicators do not reach a new peak). At
the end of a major bull market, bears may very well be ridiculed (recall how forecasts
for a top in the stock market during 2000 were received).Elliott wave principle 25

Chunk 4492 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Pattern recognition and fractals
Elliott's market model relies heavily on looking at price charts. Practitioners study developing trends to distinguish
the waves and wave structures, and discern what prices may do next; thus the application of the wave principle is a
form of pattern recognition.
The structures Elliott described also meet the common definition of a fractal (self-similar patterns appearing at every

Chunk 4493 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
degree of trend). Elliott wave practitioners say that just as naturally-occurring fractals often expand and grow more
complex over time, the model shows that collective human psychology develops in natural patterns, via buying and
selling decisions reflected in market prices: "It's as though we are somehow programmed by mathematics. Seashell,
galaxy, snowflake or human: we're all bound by the same order."[4]
Elliott wave rules and guidelines

Chunk 4494 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Elliott wave rules and guidelines
A correct Elliott wave "count" must observe three rules: 1) Wave 2 always retraces less than 100% of wave 1; 2)
Wave 3 cannot be the shortest of the three impulse waves, namely waves 1, 3 and 5; 3) Wave 4 does not overlap with
the price territory of wave 1, except in the rare case of a diagonal triangle. A common guideline observes that in a
five-wave pattern, waves 2 and 4 will often take alternate forms; a sharp move in wave 2, for example, will suggest a

Chunk 4495 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
mild move in wave 4. Corrective wave patterns unfold in forms known as zigzags, flats, or triangles. In turn these
corrective patterns can come together to form more complex corrections.[3]
Fibonacci relationships
R. N. Elliott's analysis of the mathematical properties of waves and patterns eventually led him to conclude that "The
Fibonacci Summation Series is the basis of The Wave Principle".[1] Numbers from the Fibonacci sequence surface

Chunk 4496 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
repeatedly in Elliott wave structures, including motive waves (1, 3, 5), a single full cycle (5 up, 3 down = 8 waves),
and the completed motive (89 waves) and corrective (55 waves) patterns. Elliott developed his market model before
he realized that it reflects the Fibonacci sequence. "When I discovered The Wave Principle action of market trends, I
had never heard of either the Fibonacci Series or the Pythagorean Diagram".[1]

Chunk 4497 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The Fibonacci sequence is also closely connected to the Golden ratio (1.618). Practitioners commonly use this ratio
and related ratios to establish support and resistance levels for market waves, namely the price points which help
define the parameters of a trend.[5] See Fibonacci retracement.
Finance professor Roy Batchelor and researcher Richard Ramyar, a former Director of the United Kingdom Society

Chunk 4498 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
of Technical Analysts and Head of UK Asset Management Research at Reuters Lipper, studied whether Fibonacci
ratios appear non-randomly in the stock market, as Elliott's model predicts. The researchers said the "idea that prices
retrace to a Fibonacci ratio or round fraction of the previous trend clearly lacks any scientific rationale". They also
said "there is no significant difference between the frequencies with which price and time ratios occur in cycles in

Chunk 4499 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and frequencies which we would expect to occur at random in such a time
series".[6]
Robert Prechter replied to the Batchelor–Ramyar study, saying that it "does not challenge the validity of any aspect
of the Wave Principle...it supports wave theorists' observations," and that because the authors had examined ratios
between prices achieved in filtered trends rather than Elliott waves, "their method does not address actual claims by

Chunk 4500 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
wave theorists".[7] The Socionomics Institute also reviewed data in the Batchelor–Ramyar study, and said these data
show "Fibonacci ratios do occur more often in the stock market than would be expected in a random
environment".[8]

the Elliott Wave Principle works well with other
technical analysis tendencies as prior support (the
bottom of wave-1) acts as resistance to wave-4. The
wave count depicted in the chart would be invalidated
if GBP/JPY moves above the wave-1 low.
After Elliott
Following Elliott's death in 1948, other market
technicians and financial professionals continued to use

Chunk 4502 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
the wave principle and provide forecasts to investors.
Charles Collins, who had published Elliott's "Wave
Principle" and helped introduce Elliott's theory to Wall
Street, ranked Elliott's contributions to technical
analysis on a level with Charles Dow. Hamilton Bolton, founder of The Bank Credit Analyst, provided wave
analysis to a wide readership in the 1950s and 1960s. Bolton introduced Elliott's wave principle to A.J. Frost, who

Chunk 4503 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
provided weekly financial commentary on the Financial News Network in the 1980s. Frost co-authored Elliott Wave
Principle with Robert Prechter in 1978.
Rediscovery and current use
Robert Prechter came across Elliott's works while working as a market technician at Merrill Lynch. His prominence
as a forecaster during the bull market of the 1980s brought the greatest exposure to date to Elliott's work, and today
Prechter remains the most widely known Elliott analyst.[9]

Chunk 4504 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Among market technicians, wave analysis is widely accepted as a component of their trade. Elliott's Wave principle
is among the methods included on the exam that analysts must pass to earn the Chartered Market Technician (CMT)
designation, the professional accreditation developed by the Market Technicians Association (MTA).
Robin Wilkin, Ex-Global Head of FX and Commodity Technical Strategy at JPMorgan Chase, says "the Elliott

Chunk 4505 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Wave principle ... provides a probability framework as to when to enter a particular market and where to get out,
whether for a profit or a loss."[10]
Jordan Kotick, Global Head of Technical Strategy at Barclays Capital and past President of the Market Technicians
Association, has said that R. N. Elliott's "discovery was well ahead of its time. In fact, over the last decade or two,
many prominent academics have embraced Elliott’s idea and have been aggressively advocating the existence of

Chunk 4506 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
financial market fractals."[11]
One such academic is the physicist Didier Sornette, visiting professor at the Department of Earth and Space Science
and the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at UCLA. In a paper he co-authored in 1996 ("Stock Market
Crashes, Precursors and Replicas") Sornette said,
It is intriguing that the log-periodic structures documented here bear some similarity with the "Elliott waves"

Chunk 4507 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
of technical analysis ... A lot of effort has been developed in finance both by academic and trading institutions 
and more recently by physicists (using some of their statistical tools developed to deal with complex times 
series) to analyze past data to get information on the future. The 'Elliott wave' technique is probably the most 
famous in this field. We speculate that the "Elliott waves", so strongly rooted in the financial analysts’Elliott wave principle 27

Chunk 4508 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
folklore, could be a signature of an underlying critical structure of the stock market.[12]
Paul Tudor Jones, the billionaire commodity trader, calls Prechter and Frost's standard text on Elliott "a classic," and
one of "the four Bibles of the business":
[Magee and Edwards'] Technical Analysis of Stock Trends and The Elliott Wave Theorist both give very
specific and systematic ways to approach developing great reward/risk ratios for entering into a business

Chunk 4509 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
contract with the marketplace, which is what every trade should be if properly and thoughtfully executed.[13]
Criticism
The premise that markets unfold in recognizable patterns contradicts the efficient market hypothesis, which states
that prices cannot be predicted from market data such as moving averages and volume. By this reasoning, if
successful market forecasts were possible, investors would buy (or sell) when the method predicted a price increase

Chunk 4510 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
(or decrease), to the point that prices would rise (or fall) immediately, thus destroying the profitability and predictive
power of the method. In efficient markets, knowledge of the Elliott Wave Principle among traders would lead to the
disappearance of the very patterns they tried to anticipate, rendering the method, and all forms of technical analysis,
useless.
Benoit Mandelbrot has questioned whether Elliott waves can predict financial markets:

Chunk 4511 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
But Wave prediction is a very uncertain business. It is an art to which the subjective judgement of the chartists
matters more than the objective, replicable verdict of the numbers. The record of this, as of most technical
analysis, is at best mixed.[14]
Robert Prechter had previously stated that ideas in an article by Mandelbrot[15] "originated with Ralph Nelson
Elliott, who put them forth more comprehensively and more accurately with respect to real-world markets in his

Chunk 4512 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
1938 book The Wave Principle."[16]
Critics also warn the wave principle is too vague to be useful, since it cannot consistently identify when a wave
begins or ends, and that Elliott wave forecasts are prone to subjective revision. Some who advocate technical
analysis of markets have questioned the value of Elliott wave analysis. Technical analyst David Aronson wrote:[17]
The Elliott Wave Principle, as popularly practiced, is not a legitimate theory, but a story, and a compelling one

Chunk 4513 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
that is eloquently told by Robert Prechter. The account is especially persuasive because EWP has the
seemingly remarkable ability to fit any segment of market history down to its most minute fluctuations. I
contend this is made possible by the method's loosely defined rules and the ability to postulate a large number
of nested waves of varying magnitude. This gives the Elliott analyst the same freedom and flexibility that

Chunk 4514 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
allowed pre-Copernican astronomers to explain all observed planet movements even though their underlying
theory of an Earth-centered universe was wrong.

named after their use of the Fibonacci
sequence. Fibonacci retracement is
based on the idea that markets will

Fibonacci retracement is created by
taking two extreme points on a chart

Pivot point
A pivot point is a price level of significance in technical analysis of a financial market that is used by traders as a
predictive indicator of market movement. A pivot point is calculated as an average of significant prices (high, low,

Chunk 4529 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
close) from the performance of a market in the prior trading period. If the market in the following period trades
above the pivot point it is usually evaluated as a bullish sentiment, whereas trading below the pivot point is seen as
bearish.

2009, showing sets of first and second levels of resistance (green) and support (red). The

Chunk 4530 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
pivot point levels are highlighted in yellow. Trading below the pivot point, particularly at
the beginning of a trading period sets a bearish market sentiment and often results in
further price decline, while trading above it, bullish price action may continue for some
time.
It is customary to calculate additional
levels of support and resistance, below
and above the pivot point, respectively,
by subtracting or adding price
differentials calculated from previous
trading ranges of the market.

Chunk 4531 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
trading ranges of the market.
A pivot point and the associated
support and resistance levels are often
turning points for the direction of price
movement in a market. In an
up-trending market, the pivot point and
the resistance levels may represent a
ceiling level in price above which the
uptrend is no longer sustainable and a
reversal may occur. In a declining
market, a pivot point and the support
levels may represent a low price level
of stability or a resistance to further
decline.

Chunk 4532 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
of stability or a resistance to further
decline.
Calculation
Several methods exist for calculating the pivot point (P) of a market. Most commonly, it is the arithmetic average of
the high (H), low (L), and closing (C) prices of the market in the prior trading period:
P = (H + L + C) / 3.
Sometimes, the average also includes the previous period's or the current period's opening price (O):
P = (O + H + L + C) / 4.

Chunk 4533 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
P = (O + H + L + C) / 4.
In other cases, traders like to emphasize the closing price, P = (H + L + C + C) / 4, or the current periods opening
price, P = (H + L + O + O) / 4.
Support and resistance levels
Price support and resistance levels are key trading tools in any market. Their roles may be interchangeable,
depending on whether the price level is approached in an up-trending or a down-trending market. These price levels

Chunk 4534 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
may be derived from many market assumptions and conventions. In pivot point analysis, several levels, usually
three, are commonly recognized below and above the pivot point. These are calculated from the range of price
movement in the previous trading period, added to the pivot point for resistances and subtracted from it for support
levels.Pivot point 32
The first and most significant level of support (S1) and resistance (R1) is obtained by recognition of the upper and the

Chunk 4535 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
lower halves of the prior trading range, defined by the trading above the pivot point (H − P), and below it (P − L).
The first resistance on the up-side of the market is given by the lower width of prior trading added to the pivot point
price and the first support on the down-side is the width of the upper part of the prior trading range below the pivot
point.
•R1 = P + (P − L) = 2×P − L
•S1 = P − (H − P) = 2×P − H

Chunk 4536 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
•S1 = P − (H − P) = 2×P − H
Thus, these levels may simply be calculated by subtracting the previous low (L) and high (H) price, respectively,
from twice the pivot point value:[1]
The second set of resistance (R2) and support (S2) levels are above and below, respectively, the first set. They are
simply determined from the full width of the prior trading range (H − L), added to and subtracted from the pivot
point, respectively:
•R2 = P + (H − L)
•S2 = P − (H − L)

Chunk 4537 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
•R2 = P + (H − L)
•S2 = P − (H − L)
Commonly a third set is also calculated, again representing another higher resistance level (R3) and a yet lower
support level (S3). The method of the second set is continued by doubling the range added and subtracted from the
pivot point:
•R3 = P + 2×(H − L)
•S3 = P − 2×(H − L)
This concept is sometimes, albeit rarely, extended to a fourth set in which the tripled value of the trading range is
used in the calculation.

Chunk 4538 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
used in the calculation.
Qualitatively, the second and higher support and resistance levels are always located symmetrically around the pivot
point, whereas this is not the case for the first levels, unless the pivot point happens to divide the prior trading range
exactly in half.
Trading tool
The pivot point itself represents a level of highest resistance or support, depending on the overall market condition.

Chunk 4539 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
If the market is directionless (undecided), prices will often fluctuate greatly around this level until a price breakout
develops. Trading above or below the pivot point indicates the overall market sentiment. It is a leading indicator
providing advanced signaling of potentially new market highs or lows within a given time frame.[1]
The support and resistance levels calculated from the pivot point and the previous market width may be used as exit

Chunk 4540 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
points of trades, but are rarely used as entry signals. For example, if the market is up-trending and breaks through the
pivot point, the first resistance level is often a good target to close a position, as the probability of resistance and
reversal increases greatly.Pivot point 33

support areas.[2] The half-way (middle) point between the pivot point and R1 is designated M+, between R1 and R2 is
M++, and below the pivot point the middle points are labeled as M− and M−−. In the 5-day intra-day chart of the
SPDR Gold Trust (above) the middle points can clearly be identified as support in days 1, 3, and 4, and as resistance
in days 2 and 3.

death, William Peter Hamilton, Robert Rhea and E. George Schaefer organized and collectively represented "Dow
Theory," based on Dow's editorials. Dow himself never used the term "Dow Theory," nor presented it as a trading
system.
The six basic tenets of Dow Theory as summarized by Hamilton, Rhea, and Schaefer are described below.
Six basic tenets of Dow Theory
1.The market has three movements

Chunk 4544 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
1.The market has three movements
(1) The "main movement", primary movement or major trend may last from less than a year to several years. It
can be bullish or bearish. (2) The "medium swing", secondary reaction or intermediate reaction may last from
ten days to three months and generally retraces from 33% to 66% of the primary price change since the
previous medium swing or start of the main movement. (3) The "short swing" or minor movement varies with

Chunk 4545 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
opinion from hours to a month or more. The three movements may be simultaneous, for instance, a daily
minor movement in a bearish secondary reaction in a bullish primary movement.
2.Market trends have three phases
Dow Theory asserts that major market trends are composed of three phases: an accumulation phase, a public
participation phase, and a distribution phase. The accumulation phase (phase 1) is a period when investors "in

Chunk 4546 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
the know" are actively buying (selling) stock against the general opinion of the market. During this phase, the
stock price does not change much because these investors are in the minority absorbing (releasing) stock that
the market at large is supplying (demanding). Eventually, the market catches on to these astute investors and a
rapid price change occurs (phase 2). This occurs when trend followers and other technically oriented investors

Chunk 4547 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
participate. This phase continues until rampant speculation occurs. At this point, the astute investors begin to
distribute their holdings to the market (phase 3).
3.The stock market discounts all news
Stock prices quickly incorporate new information as soon as it becomes available. Once news is released,
stock prices will change to reflect this new information. On this point, Dow Theory agrees with one of the
premises of the efficient market hypothesis.

Chunk 4548 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
premises of the efficient market hypothesis.
4.Stock market averages must confirm each other
In Dow's time, the US was a growing industrial power. The US had population centers but factories were
scattered throughout the country. Factories had to ship their goods to market, usually by rail. Dow's first stock
averages were an index of industrial (manufacturing) companies and rail companies. To Dow, a bull market in

Chunk 4549 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
industrials could not occur unless the railway average rallied as well, usually first. According to this logic, if
manufacturers' profits are rising, it follows that they are producing more. If they produce more, then they have
to ship more goods to consumers. Hence, if an investor is looking for signs of health in manufacturers, he or
she should look at the performance of the companies that ship the output of them to market, the railroads. The

Chunk 4550 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
two averages should be moving in the same direction. When the performance of the averages diverge, it is a
warning that change is in the air.
Both Barron's Magazine and the Wall Street Journal still publish the daily performance of the Dow Jones
Transportation Index in chart form. The index contains major railroads, shipping companies, and air freight
carriers in the US.
5.Trends are confirmed by volumeDow Theory 35

Chunk 4551 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
5.Trends are confirmed by volumeDow Theory 35
Dow believed that volume confirmed price trends. When prices move on low volume, there could be many
different explanations why. An overly aggressive seller could be present for example. But when price
movements are accompanied by high volume, Dow believed this represented the "true" market view. If many
participants are active in a particular security, and the price moves significantly in one direction, Dow

Chunk 4552 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
maintained that this was the direction in which the market anticipated continued movement. To him, it was a
signal that a trend is developing.
6.Trends exist until definitive signals prove that they have ended
Dow believed that trends existed despite "market noise". Markets might temporarily move in the direction
opposite to the trend, but they will soon resume the prior move. The trend should be given the benefit of the

Chunk 4553 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
doubt during these reversals. Determining whether a reversal is the start of a new trend or a temporary
movement in the current trend is not easy. Dow Theorists often disagree in this determination. Technical
analysis tools attempt to clarify this but they can be interpreted differently by different investors.
Analysis
There is little academic support for the profitability of the Dow Theory. Alfred Cowles in a study in Econometrica in

Chunk 4554 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
1934 showed that trading based upon the editorial advice would have resulted in earning less than a buy-and-hold
strategy using a well diversified portfolio. Cowles concluded that a buy-and-hold strategy produced 15.5%
annualized returns from 1902-1929 while the Dow Theory strategy produced annualized returns of 12%. After
numerous studies supported Cowles over the following years, many academics stopped studying Dow Theory
believing Cowles's results were conclusive.

Chunk 4555 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
believing Cowles's results were conclusive.
In recent years however, Cowles' conclusions have been revisited. William Goetzmann, Stephen Brown, and Alok
Kumar believe that Cowles' study was incomplete [1] and that Dow Theory produces excess risk-adjusted returns.[2]
Specifically, the return of a buy-and-hold strategy was higher than that of a Dow Theory portfolio by 2%, but the
riskiness and volatility of the Dow Theory portfolio was lower, so that the Dow Theory portfolio produced higher

Chunk 4556 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
risk-adjusted returns according to their study. Nevertheless, adjusting returns for risk is controversial in the context
of the Dow Theory. One key problem with any analysis of Dow Theory is that the editorials of Charles Dow did not
contain explicitly defined investing "rules" so some assumptions and interpretations are necessary.
Many technical analysts consider Dow Theory's definition of a trend and its insistence on studying price action as the
main premises of modern technical analysis.

CHARTS
Candlestick chart
Candlestick chart of EURUSD
A candlestick chart is a style of
bar-chart used primarily to describe
price movements of a security,
derivative, or currency over time.
It is a combination of a line-chart and a
bar-chart, in that each bar represents the
range of price movement over a given

Chunk 4561 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
range of price movement over a given
time interval. It is most often used in
technical analysis of equity and
currency price patterns. They appear
superficially similar to error bars, but
are unrelated.
History
Candlestick charts are thought to have
been developed in the 18th century by
Japanese rice trader of financial instruments.
Candlestick chart topics
The basic candlestick
Candlesticks are usually composed of the body (black or
white), and an upper and a lower shadow (wick): the area

Chunk 4562 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
between the open and the close is called the real body,
price excursions above and below the real body are called
shadows. The wick illustrates the highest and lowest
traded prices of a security during the time interval
represented. The body illustrates the opening and closing
trades. If the security closed higher than it opened, the
body is white or unfilled, with the opening price at the
bottom of the body and the closing price at the top. If the

Chunk 4563 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
security closed lower than it opened, the body is black,
with the opening price at the top and the closing price at
the bottom. A candlestick need not have either a body or
a wick.
To better highlight price movements, modern candlestick charts (especially those displayed digitally) often replace
the black or white of the candlestick body with colors such as red (for a lower closing) and blue or green (for a
higher closing).Candlestick chart 38
Candlestick simple patterns

Chunk 4564 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Candlestick simple patterns
There are multiple forms of candlestick chart patterns
Complex Patterns
In addition to the rather simple patterns depicted in the section above, there are more complex and difficult patterns
which have been identified since the charting method's inception. Complex patterns can be colored or highlighted for
better visualization.
Candlestick charts also convey more information than other forms of charts, such as bar charts. Just as with bar

Chunk 4565 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
charts, they display the absolute values of the open, high, low, and closing price for a given period. But they also
show how those prices are relative to the prior periods' prices, so one can tell by looking at one bar if the price action
is higher or lower than the prior one. They are also visually easier to look at , and can be coloured for even better
definition. Rather than using the open-high-low-close for a given time period (for example, 5 minute, 1 hour, 1 day,

Chunk 4566 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
1 month), candlesticks can also be constructed using the open-high-low-close of a specified volume range (for
example, 1,000; 100,000; 1 million shares per candlestick).
Use of candlestick charts
Candlestick charts are a visual aid for decision making in stock, forex, commodity, and options trading. For example,
when the bar is white and high relative to other time periods, it means buyers are very bullish. The opposite is true
for a black bar.
Heikin-Ashi candlesticks

Chunk 4567 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
for a black bar.
Heikin-Ashi candlesticks
Heikin-Ashi (Japanese for 'average bar') candlesticks are a weighted version of candlesticks calculated with the
following formula:
•Open = (open of previous bar+close of previous bar)/2
•Close = (open+high+low+close)/4
•High = maximum of high, open, or close (whichever is highest)
•Low = minimum of low, open, or close (whichever is lowest)

Chunk 4568 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Heikin-Ashi candlesticks must be used with caution with regards to the price as the body doesn't necessarily sync up
with the actual open/close. Unlike with regular candlesticks, a long wick shows more strength, whereas the same
period on a standard chart might show a long body with little or no wick. Depending on the software or user
preference, Heikin-Ashi may be used to chart the price (instead of line, bar, or candlestick), as an indicator overlaid

Chunk 4569 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
on a regular chart, or an as indicator plotted on a separate window.

Chunk 4570 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
superimposed.
An open-high-low-close chart (also OHLC chart, or
simply bar chart) is a type of chart typically used to
illustrate movements in the price of a financial
instrument over time. Each vertical line on the chart
shows the price range (the highest and lowest prices)
over one unit of time, e.g. one day or one hour. Tick
marks project from each side of the line indicating the
opening price (e.g. for a daily bar chart this would be
the starting price for that day) on the left, and the

Chunk 4571 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
closing price for that time period on the right. The bars
may be shown in different hues depending on whether
prices rose or fell in that period.
The Japanese candlestick chart is another way of
displaying market price data, with the opening and
closing prices defining a rectangle within the range for each time unit. Both charts show exactly the same data, i.e.
the opening, high, low, and closing prices during a particular time frame. Some traders find the candlestick chart
easier to read.

Line chart
This simple graph shows
data over intervals with
connected points
A line chart or line graph is a type of graph, which displays information as a series of
data points connected by straight line segments.[1] It is a basic type of chart common in
many fields. It is an extension of a scatter graph, and is created by connecting a series of

Chunk 4573 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
points that represent individual measurements with line segments. A line chart is often
used to visualize a trend in data over intervals of time – a time series – thus the line is
often drawn chronologically.[2]
Example
In the experimental sciences, data collected from experiments are often visualized by a
graph that includes an overlaid mathematical function depicting the best-fit trend of the
scattered data. This layer is referred to as a best-fit layer and the graph containing this

Chunk 4574 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
layer is often referred to as a line graph.
For example, if one were to collect data on the speed of a body at certain points in time, one could visualize the data
by a data table such as the following:
Graph of Speed Vs Time
 Elapsed Time (s) Speed (ms−1)
0 0
1 3
2 7
3 12
4 20
5 30
6 45
The table "visualization" is a great way of displaying exact values, but a very bad way of understanding the

Chunk 4575 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
underlying patterns that those values represent. Because of these qualities, the table display is often erroneouslyLine chart 41
conflated with the data itself; whereas it is just another visualization of the data.
Understanding the process described by the data in the table is aided by producing a graph or line chart of Speed
versus Time. In this context, Versus (or the abbreviations vs and VS), separates the parameters appearing in an X-Y

Chunk 4576 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
(two-dimensional) graph. The first argument indicates the dependent variable, usually appearing on the Y-axis, while
the second argument indicates the independent variable, usually appearing on the X-axis. So, the graph of Speed
versus Time would plot time along the x-axis and speed up the y-axis. Mathematically, if we denote time by the
variable , and speed by , then the function plotted in the graph would be denoted indicating that (the
dependent variable) is a function of .

Chunk 4577 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
dependent variable) is a function of .
It is simple to construct a "best-fit" layer consisting of a set of line segments connecting adjacent data points;
however, such a "best-fit" is usually not an ideal representation of the trend of the underlying scatter data for the
following reasons:
1.It is highly improbable that the discontinuities in the slope of the best-fit would correspond exactly with the
positions of the measurement values.

Chunk 4578 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
positions of the measurement values.
2.It is highly unlikely that the experimental error in the data is negligible, yet the curve falls exactly through each of
the data points.
A true best-fit layer should depict a continuous mathematical function whose parameters are determined by using a
suitable error-minimization scheme, which appropriately weights the error in the data values.

Chunk 4579 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
In either case, the best-fit layer can reveal trends in the data. Further, measurements such as the gradient or the area
under the curve can be made visually, leading to more conclusions or results from the data.

Point and figure chart
Point and figure is a charting technique used in technical analysis, used to attempt to predict financial market
prices. Point and figure charting is unique in that it does not plot price against time as all other techniques do. Instead
it plots price against changes in direction by plotting a column of Xs as the price rises and a column of Os as the
price falls.
History

Chunk 4581 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
price falls.
History
The technique is over 100 years old. "Hoyle" was the first to write about it and showed charts in his 1898 book, The
Game in Wall Street.[1] Richard Wyckoff also described the technique with charts in his 1910 classic, Studies in
Tape Reading. The first book/manual dedicated to Point and Figure was written by Victor Devilliers in 1933.
Chartcraft Inc, in the USA, popularized the system in the 1940s. Cohen founded Chartcraft and wrote on point and

Chunk 4582 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
figure charting in 1947. Chartcraft published further pioneering books on P&F charting, namely those by Burke, Aby
and Zieg. Chartcraft Inc is still running today, providing daily point and figure services for the US market under the
name of Investors Intelligence. Veteran Mike Burke still works for Chartcraft, having started back in 1962 under the
guidance of Cohen. Burke went on to train other point and figure gurus, such as Dorsey.

Chunk 4583 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
A detailed history can be found in Jeremy du Plessis’ ‘The Definitive Guide to Point and Figure’ where many
references and examples are cited.
Du Plessis describes their development from a price recording system to a charting method. Traders kept track of
prices by writing them down in columns. They noticed patterns in their price record and started referring to them
first as ‘fluctuation charts’ and then as ‘figure charts’. They started using Xs instead of numbers and these charts

Chunk 4584 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
became known as ‘point charts’. Traders used both point charts and figure charts together and referred to them as
their point and figure charts, which is where Du Plessis suggests the name point and figure came from. Modern point
and figure charts are drawn with Xs and Os where columns of Xs are rising prices and columns of Os are falling
prices, although many tradionalists such as David Fuller and Louise Yamada still use the Xs only point method of
plotting.

Chunk 4585 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
plotting.
How to drawPoint and figure chart 43
The correct way to draw a point and figure chart is to plot every price
change but practicality has rendered this difficult to do for a large
quantity of stocks so many point and figure chartists use the summary
prices at the end of each day. Some prefer to use the day’s closing price
and some prefer to use the day’s high or low depending on the direction
of the last column. The high/low method was invented by A.W. Cohen

Chunk 4586 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
in his 1947 book, 'How to Use the Three-Point Reversal Method of
Point & Figure Stock Market Timing' and has a large following.
The charts are constructed by deciding on the value represented by
each X and O. Any price change below this value is ignored so point
and figure acts as a filter to filter out the smaller price changes. The
charts change column when the price changes direction by the value of
a certain number of Xs or Os. Traditionally this was one and is called a

Chunk 4587 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
1 box reversal chart. More common is three, called a 3 box reversal
chart.
45 Degree Trend lines
Because point and figure charts are plotted on squared paper, 45 degree lines may be used to define up trends and
down trends from important highs and lows on the chart allowing objective analysis of trends.
Price Targets
Also in common usage are two methods of obtaining price targets from point and figure charts. The vertical method

Chunk 4588 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
measures the length of the thrust off a high or low and projects the thrust to obtain a target. The horizontal method
measures the width of a congestion pattern and uses that to obtain a target.
Computerization
In the US, Chartcraft used an IBM S/360 in the 1960s to produce point and figure charts.
Point and Figure charts were automated in the UK in the early 1980s by the Indexia company run by Jeremy Du

Chunk 4589 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Plessis. This automation increased the popularity and usage of point and figure charts because hundreds of charts
could be viewed and altered quickly and easily. At the same time a method of log scaling point and figure charts was
devised, where the value of the Xs and Os was set to a percentage rather than a price. This allowed the sensitivity of
Point and Figure charts to remain constant no matter what the price level.

Chunk 4590 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Kaufman, in New Trading Systems and Methods, 2005, documents research he and Kermit Zeig performed over
many years computerizing point and figure charting. LeBeau and Lucas also developed computerized point and

Kagi chart
The Kagi chart is a chart used for tracking price movements and to make decisions on purchasing stock. It differs

Chunk 4598 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
from traditional stock charts, such as the Candlestick chart by being mostly independent of time. This feature aids in
producing a chart that reduces random noise.
Due to its effectiveness in showing a clear path of price movements, the Kagi chart is one of the various charts that
investors use to make better decisions about stocks. The most important benefit of this chart is that it is independent
of time and change of direction occurs only when a specific amount is reached.

trading.[1] It was used for tracking the price movement of rice and found use in determining the general levels of
supply and demand for certain assets.
Construction
Kagi charts look similar to swing charts and do not have a time axis.[2] A Kagi chart is created with a series of

Chunk 4600 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
vertical lines connected by short horizontal lines. The thickness and direction of the lines is based on the price of the
underlying stock or asset, as follows:
•The thickness of the line changes when the price reaches the high or low of the previous vertical line.
•The direction of the line changes when the price reaches a preset reversal amount, which is usually set at 4%.
When a direction change occurs, a short horizontal line is drawn between the lines of opposite direction.

Chunk 4601 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Alternatively, thin and thick lines can be replaced with lines of different colours, such as the green/red example in
the figure.
Changes in line thickness are used to generate transaction signals. Buy signals are generated when the Kagi line goes
from thin to thick and sell signals are generated when the line turns from thick to thin.Kagi chart 46
How to plot a Kagi chart
1.Find the starting point. The starting point is generally considered the first closing price. From this point forward,

Chunk 4602 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
you compare each day's closing price with the starting price.
2.Draw a thin vertical line from the starting price to each day's closing price, while the trend does not reverse.
3.If a day's closing price moves in the opposite direction to the trend by more than the reversal amount, draw a
short horizontal line and a new vertical line, beginning from the horizontal line to the new closing price.

Chunk 4603 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
4.If the price on a day is greater than or equal to the previous high, change to a thick line and continue the vertical
line. If the price on that day is less than or equal to the previous low, then change to a thin line.

PATTERNS: Chart Pattern
Chart pattern
A chart pattern is a pattern that is formed within a chart when prices are graphed. In stock and commodity markets
trading, chart pattern studies play a large role during technical analysis. When data is plotted there is usually a

Chunk 4605 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
pattern which naturally occurs and repeats over a period of time. Chart patterns are used as either reversal or
continuation signals.
Some people claim that by recognizing chart patterns they are able to predict future stock prices and profit by this
prediction; other people respond by quoting "past performance is no guarantee of future results" and argue that chart
patterns are merely illusions created by people's subconscious. Certain theories of economics hold that if there were

Chunk 4606 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
a way to predict future stock prices and profit by it then when enough people used these techniques they would
become ineffective and cease to be profitable. On the other hand, if you can predict what other people will predict
the market to do then that would be valuable information.
Patterns
Examples of "classical" chart patterns as popularized by Edwards and Magee and used widely by traders and
investors include:
•Head and shoulders

Head and shoulders (chart pattern)

Chunk 4608 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Head and shoulders (chart pattern)
The Head and Shoulders formation is one of the most well known reversal patterns.
On the technical analysis chart, when a price trend is in the process of reversal either from a bullish or bearish trend,
a characteristic pattern takes shape and is recognized as reversal formation.
Formations
Head and Shoulders Top and Head and Shoulders Bottom is discussed below.
Head and shoulders top
Head and Shoulders Top
Head and Shoulders formation consists of a left

Chunk 4609 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Head and Shoulders formation consists of a left
shoulder, a head, and a right shoulder and a line
drawn as the neckline. The left shoulder is formed at
the end of an extensive move during which volume is
noticeably high. After the peak of the left shoulder is
formed, there is a subsequent reaction and prices
slide down up to a certain extent which generally
occurs on low volume. The prices rally up to form
the head with normal or heavy volume and
subsequent reaction downward is accompanied with

Chunk 4610 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
subsequent reaction downward is accompanied with
lesser volume. The right shoulder is formed when
prices move up again but remain below the central
peak called the Head and fall down nearly equal to
the first valley between the left shoulder and the head
or at least below the peak of the left shoulder.
Volume is lesser in the right shoulder formation
compared to the left shoulder and the head formation.

Chunk 4611 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
A neckline is drawn across the bottoms of the left shoulder, the head and the right shoulder. When prices break
through this neckline and keep on falling after forming the right shoulder, it is the ultimate confirmation of the
completion of the Head and Shoulders Top formation. It is quite possible that prices pull back to touch the neckline
before continuing their declining trend.Head and shoulders (chart pattern) 49
Head and shoulders bottom
Head and Shoulders Bottom

Chunk 4612 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Head and Shoulders Bottom
This formation is simply the inverse of a Head and
Shoulders Top and often indicates a change in the
trend and the sentiment. The formation is upside
down in which volume pattern is different than a
Head and Shoulder Top. Prices move up from first
low with increase volume up to a level to complete
the left shoulder formation and then falls down to a
new low. It follows by a recovery move that is
marked by somewhat more volume than seen before

Chunk 4613 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
marked by somewhat more volume than seen before
to complete the head formation. A corrective reaction
on low volume occurs to start formation of the right
shoulder and then a sharp move up that must be on
quite heavy volume breaks though the neckline.
Another difference between the Head and Shoulders
Top and Bottom is that the Top Formations are completed in a few weeks, whereas a Major Bottom (Left, right

Chunk 4614 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
shoulder or the head) usually takes a longer, and as observed, may prolong for a period of several months or
sometimes more than a year.
Importance of neckline
The drawn neckline of the pattern represents a support level, and assumption cannot be taken that the Head and
Shoulder formation is completed unless it is broken and such breakthrough may happen to be on more volume or
may not be. The breakthrough should not be observed carelessly. A serious situation can occur if such a break is

Chunk 4615 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
more than three to four percent.
When a stock drifts through the neckline on small volume, there may be a wave up, although it is not certain, but it is
observed, the rally normally does not cross the general level of the Neckline and before selling pressure increases,
the steep decline occurs and prices tumble with greater volume.
Characteristics
•Most of the time Head and Shoulders are not perfectly shaped. This formation is slightly tilted upward or
downward.

Chunk 4616 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
downward.
•One shoulder may appear to droop.
•On many chart patterns, any one of the two shoulders may appear broader than the other which is caused by the
time involved in the formation of the valleys.
•The neckline may not be perfectly horizontal; it may be ascending or descending.
•If the neckline is ascending then the only qualification of the formation lies in the fact that the lowest point of the
right shoulder must be noticeably lower than the peak of the left shoulder.
Usage as a tool

Chunk 4617 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Usage as a tool
Head and Shoulders is an extremely useful tool after its confirmation to estimate and measure the minimum probable
extent of the subsequent move form the neckline. To find the distance of subsequent move, measure the distance
form the peak of the head to the neckline. Then measure the same distance down from the neckline to the point
where prices penetrate the neckline after the completion of the right shoulder. This gives the minimum objective of

Chunk 4618 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
how far prices can decline after the completion of this top formation.Head and shoulders (chart pattern) 50
In case, if the price advance preceding the Head and Shoulders top is not long, the subsequent price fall after its
completion may be small as well.

Cup and handle
The cup and handle formation (also called the cup with handle formation) is a bullish chart pattern that is defined
by a chart where a stock drops in value, then rises back up to the original value, then drops a small amount in value,
and then rises a small amount in value.
Important characteristics

Chunk 4620 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Important characteristics
•Trend: A cup and handle formation should follow an increase trend, ideally one that is only a few months old.
The older the increase trend, the less likely it is that the cup and handle will be an accurate indicator.
•Shape: In a cup and handle formation, the cup must always precede the handle. The cup should form a rounded
bowl shape, with an obvious bottom. A V-shaped bowl is said to be avoided. The cup should be fairly shallow,

Chunk 4621 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
and ideally should retrace about 30% to 50% of the previous increase.[1] The perfect pattern would have equal
highs on either side of the cup, but this is not always the case.
•Duration: The cup should last 1 to 6 months, while the handle should only last for 1 to 4 weeks.[1] These are only
approximate values, however; a cup may last anywhere from a few weeks to a few years.
•Volume: The volume of the stock should decrease along with the price during the cup and should increase rapidly

Chunk 4622 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
near the end of the handle when the price begins to rise.[1]
Significance for traders
A cup and handle formation is considered to be a bullish signal, and is usually followed by a sharp rise in value. A
rather accurate estimation of the expected price rise is found by measuring the price rise from the bottom of the cup
to the right side.[1] The reason for a price rise following a cup and handle formation is largely unknown. Likely

Chunk 4623 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
because many traders know about this signal and buy when they see it forming thus artificially creating the bullish
uptrend.

Double top and double bottom

Chunk 4624 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Double top and double bottom
Double top and double bottom are reversal chart patterns observed in the technical analysis of financial trading
markets of stocks, commodities, currencies, and other assets.
Double top
Double top confirmation
The double top is a frequent price formation
at the end of a bull market. It appears as two
consecutive peaks of approximately the
same price on a price-versus-time chart of a
market. The two peaks are separated by a
minimum in price, a valley. The price level

Chunk 4625 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
minimum in price, a valley. The price level
of this minimum is called the neck line of
the formation. The formation is completed
and confirmed when the price falls below
the neck line, indicating that further price
decline is imminent or highly likely.
The double top pattern shows that demand is
outpacing supply (buyers predominate) up
to the first top, causing prices to rise. The
supply-demand balance then reverses;

Chunk 4626 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
supply-demand balance then reverses;
supply outpaces demand (sellers predominate), causing prices to fall. After a price valley, buyers again predominate
and prices rise. If traders see that prices are not pushing past their level at the first top, sellers may again prevail,
lowering prices and causing a double top to form. It is generally regarded as a bearish signal if prices drop below the
neck line.

Chunk 4627 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
neck line.
The time between the two peaks is also a determining factor for the existence of a double top pattern. If the tops
appear at the same level but are very close in time, then the probability is high that they are part of the consolidation
and the trend will resume.
Volume is another indicator for interpreting this formation. Price reaches the first peak on increased volume then

Chunk 4628 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
falls down the valley with low volume. Another attempt on the rally up to the second peak should be on a lower
volume.Double top and double bottom 52
Double bottom
Double bottom confirmation
A double bottom is the end formation in a
declining market. It is identical to the double
top, except for the inverse relationship in
price. The pattern is formed by two price
minima separated by local peak defining the
neck line.

second bottom.

Formation
The formation of triple tops is rarer than that of double tops in the rising market
trend. The volume is usually low during the second rally up and lesser during the
formation of the third top. The peaks may not necessarily be spaced evenly like

exactly the same level, i.e. either the first or second may be lower. The triple top is
confirmed when the price decline from the third top falls below the bottom of the
lowest valley between the three peaks.

Opportunity
There are several different trading strategies that can be employed to take advantage

of this formation. Of course, first and second peaks are perfect point to place sell
orders. After the Double top has been confirmed and if prices are moving up again
with low volume, it is an opportune point to sell. One can sell short with a stop
(calculated loss) above the highest peak of the Double Top. The next opportune
point to sell would be after a Triple top has formed and a fourth top is being formed
at the lower level.

Chunk 4633 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
at the lower level.
Notes Observation shows that it is rare to see four tops or bottoms at equal levels. In
case prices continue to rally up to the level of the three previous tops, there is a good
chance that they will rally up higher. If they come down to the same level a fourth
time, they usually decline.
Triple bottom

bottom should be on low volume and the rally up from that bottom should show a
marked increase in activity.
The formation of Triple Bottom occurs during the period of accumulation.

Wedge pattern
The wedge pattern is a commonly found pattern in the price charts of financially traded assets (stocks, bonds,

Chunk 4640 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
futures, etc.). The pattern is characterized by a contracting range in prices coupled with an upward trend in prices
(known as a rising wedge) or a downward trend in prices (known as a falling wedge).
A wedge pattern is considered to be a temporary halt of primary trend. It is a type of formation in which trading
activities are confined within converging straight lines which form a pattern. It should take about 3 to 4 weeks to

Chunk 4641 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
complete the wedge. This pattern has a rising or falling slant pointing in the same direction. It differs from the
triangle in the sense that both boundary lines either slope up or down. Price breaking out point creates another
difference from the triangle. Falling and rising wedges are a small part of intermediate or major trend. As they are
reserved for minor trends, they are not considered to be major patterns. Once that basic or primary trend resumes

itself, the wedge pattern looses its effectiveness as a technical indicator.
Falling wedge
Falling wedge
The falling wedge pattern is characterized by a chart pattern which
forms when the market makes lower lows and lower highs with a
contracting range. When this pattern is found in a downward trend,
it is considered a reversal pattern, as the contraction of the range
indicates the downtrend is losing steam. When this pattern is found

Chunk 4643 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
in an uptrend, it is considered a bullish pattern, as the market range
becomes narrower into the correction, indicating that the
downward trend is losing strength and the resumption of the
uptrend is in the making.
In a falling wedge, both boundary lines slant down from left to
right. The upper descends at a steeper angle than the lower line.
Volume keeps on diminishing and trading activity slows down due
to narrowing prices. There comes the breaking point, and trading

activity after the breakout differs. Once prices move out of the
specific boundary lines of a falling wedge, they are more likely to
move sideways and saucer-out before they resume the basic trend.Wedge pattern 57
Rising wedge
Rising wedge
The rising wedge pattern is characterized by a chart pattern which
forms when the market makes higher highs and higher lows with a
contracting range. When this pattern is found in an uptrend, it is

considered a reversal pattern, as the contraction of the range
indicates that the uptrend is losing strength. When this pattern is
found in a downtrend, it is considered a bearish pattern, as the
market range becomes narrower into the correction, indicating that
the correction is losing strength, and that the resumption of the
downtrend is in the making.
In a rising wedge, both boundary lines slant up from left to right.
Although both lines point in the same direction, the lower line

Chunk 4646 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
rises at a steeper angle then the upper one. Prices usually decline
after breaking through the lower boundary line. As far as volumes
are concerned, they keep on declining with each new price
advance or wave up, indicating that the demand is weakening at
the higher price level. A rising wedge is more reliable when found in a bearish market. In a bullish trend what seems
to be a Rising Wedge may actually be a Flag or a Pennant (stepbrother of a wedge) requiring about 4 weeks to
complete.

Triangle (chart pattern)
Triangles are a commonly found in the price charts of financially traded assets (stocks, bonds, futures, etc). The
pattern derives its name from the fact that it is characterized by a contraction in price range and converging
trendlines, thus giving it a triangular shape.

Chunk 4648 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
trendlines, thus giving it a triangular shape.
Triangle Patterns can be broken down into three categories: the ascending triangle, the descending triangle, and the
symmetrical triangle. While the shape of the triangle is significant, of more importance is the direction that the
market moves when it breaks out of the triangle. Lastly, while triangles can sometimes be reversal
patterns—meaning a reversal of the prior trend—they are normally seen as continuation patterns (meaning a

Chunk 4649 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
continuation of the prior trend).
The Ascending Triangle
The ascending triangle is formed when the market makes higher lows and the same level highs. These patterns are
normally seen in an uptrend and viewed as a continuation pattern as buying demand gain more and more control,
running up to the top resistance line of the pattern. While you normally will see this pattern form in an uptrend, if

you do see it in a downtrend it should be paid attention to as it can act as a powerful reversal signal.

The Descending Triangle
The descending triangle is formed when the market makes lower highs and the same level lows. These patterns are

upside and a reversal pattern if the market breaks to the downside. Similarly if the pattern forms in a downtrend it is
considered a continuation pattern if the market breaks out to the downside and a reversal pattern if the market breaks
to the upside.

Flag and pennant patterns
The flag and pennant patterns are commonly found patterns in the price charts of financially traded assets (stocks,
bonds, futures, etc). The patterns are characterized by a clear direction of the price trend, followed by a consolidation
and rangebound movement, which is then followed by a resumption of the trend.
Flag pattern

Chunk 4654 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Flag pattern
The flag pattern is encompassed by two parallel lines. These lines can be either flat or pointed in the opposite
direction of the primary market trend. The pole is then formed by a line which represents the primary trend in the
market. The pattern is seen as the market potentially just taking a “breather” after a big move before continuing its
primary trend. The chart below illustrates.Flag and pennant patterns 61

Chunk 4656 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The Island Reversal
The Island Reversals
In general terms, The Island Reversal
can be defined as a compact trading
activity within a range of prices,
separated from the move proceeding it;
this separation is caused by an
Exhaustion Gap and the subsequent
move in the opposite direction occurs
as a result of a Breakaway Gap.
Formation
Close scrutiny of Island Reversal
formations shows that the Island
Reversal consists of an Exhaustion
Gap and the subsequent move is
followed by a Breakaway Gap.

Chunk 4657 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
followed by a Breakaway Gap.
Uncommonly, the Breakaway Gap that completes the Island is filled in a few days by a pull back as a result of the
reaction. The Island Reversal can occur at the peak or the reverse of Head and Shoulders formations.
For example, assume that the price in a rising trend closes at its high of $84.00 and opens at $91.00 the following
day and then does not fall below its opening. Near the end of the day, it moves up further and touches $97.00 but

Chunk 4658 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
closes at $96.00 however. Observation thus shows a gap of $7.00 which is not filled. On the following day market
price open at $94.00, touches high of $96.00 and closes at $90.00. A few days later or the very next day, market
price opens at $84.00 and closes at $83.00, keeping itself below the area of $91.00 and $84.00. All the trading above
$91.00 will appear on the Technical analysis chart to be isolated and is known as, "The Island Reversal."

Chunk 4659 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Characteristics
•The occurrence of The Island Reversal is rather rare.
•It consists of a minor move.
•It is not, in itself of major significance.
•It can occur at the Top as well as at the Bottom.
•The Gaps at either end occur at almost the same price level.
•It has a compact trading activity that is separated from the subsequent move which is in the opposite direction.
•It is an extremely good indicator of a reversal of primary or intermediate trend.

Chunk 4660 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
•As soon as it appears, it indicates that an extreme change in the sentiment has occurred.
•High volume is expected in that compact trading area.
•The trading activity may last for only a single day or a couple of days. When this arrangement occurs for only a
single day, it is known as One Day Reversal.The Island Reversal 64
Caution
This can be compared with the scenario that on reaching an island, a boat will leave it immediately after unloading

Chunk 4661 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
some of its load. This entire process is very rapid. A crew member engaged in trading onshore if left behind in the
frenzy will be subject to mental stress on how to transport his bargained goods. Even if he manages to swim against
the waves of worries and reaches the boat along with his purchases, he shall incur losses by damage to the items.
Hence, caution should be exercised in taking a step on the island at top level with a bullish attitude.
Gap (chart pattern)
Sequence of Gaps

Chunk 4662 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Gap (chart pattern)
Sequence of Gaps
A gap is defined as an unfilled space
or interval. On a technical analysis
chart, a gap represents an area where
no trading takes place. On the Japanese
candlestick chart, a window is
interpreted as a gap.
In an upward trend, a gap is produced
when the highest price of one day is
lower than the lowest price of the
following day. Thus, in a downward
trend, a gap occurs when the lowest
price of any one day is higher than the
highest price of the next day.

Chunk 4663 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
highest price of the next day.
For example, the price of a share
reaches a high of $30.00 on
Wednesday, and opens at $36.00 on
Thursday, falls down to $35.00 in the early hour, moves straight up again to $37.00, and no trading occurs in
between $30.00 and $35.00 area. This no-trading zone appears on the chart as a gap.
Gaps can play an important role when spotted before the beginning of a move.
Types of gaps

Chunk 4664 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Types of gaps
There are four different types of gaps, excluding the gap that occurs as a result of a stock going ex-dividend. Since
each type of gap has its own distinctive implication, it is very important to be able distinguish between such gaps.
•Breakway gap : It occurs when prices break away from an area of congestion. When the price is breaking away
from a triangle (Ascending or Descending) with a gap then it can be implied that change in sentiment is strong

Chunk 4665 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
and coming move will be powerful. One must keep an eye on the volume. If it is heavy after the gap is formed
then there is a good chance that market does not return to fill the gap. When the price is breaking away on a low
volume, there is a possibility that the gap will be filled before prices resume their trend.
•Common gap : It is also known as area gap, pattern gap or temporary gap. They tend to occur when trading is

Chunk 4666 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
bound between support and resistance level on a short span of time and market price is moving sideways. One can
also see them in price congestion area. Usually, the price moves back or goes up in order to fill the gaps in the
coming days. If the gap is filled, then they offer, not much in the way of forecasting significance.
•Exhaustion gap signals end of a move. These gaps are associated with a rapid, straight-line advance or decline.

Chunk 4667 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
When they are formed at the top with heavy volume, there are significant chances that the market is exhaustedGap (chart pattern) 65
and reversal is ahead. A reversal day can easily differentiate between the Measuring gap and the Exhaustion gap.
•Measuring Gap : Also known as Runaway Gap, a Measuring gap is formed usually in the half way of a price
move. It is not associated with the congestion area, it is more likely to occur approximately in the middle of rapid

Chunk 4668 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
advance or decline. It can be used to measure how much further ahead a move will go.
Caution
It is quite possible that confusion between measuring gap and exhaustion gap can cause an investor to position
himself incorrectly and to miss significant gains during the last half of a major uptrend. Keeping an eye on the
volume can help to find the clue between measuring gap and exhaustion gap. Normally, noticeable heavy volume
accompanies the arrival of exhaustion gap.
Trading gaps for profit

Chunk 4669 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Trading gaps for profit
Some market speculators "Fade" the gap on the opening of a market. This means for example that if the S&P 500
closed the day before at 1150 (16:15 EST) and opens today at 1160 (09:30 EST), they will short the market
expecting this "upgap" to close. A "downgap" would mean today opens at for example 1140, and the speculator buys
the market at the open expecting the "downgap to close". The probability of this happening on any given day is

Chunk 4670 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
around 70%, depending on which market you look at. Once the probability of "gap fill" on any given day or
technical position is established, then the best setups for this trade can be identified. Some days have such a low
probability of the gap filling that speculators will trade in the direction of the gap.

PATTERNS: Candlestick pattern
Candlestick pattern
This page provides brief introduction to the patterns of Japanese Candlesticks Chart. Please note that candlestick

Chunk 4673 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
pattern recognition is subjective and programs that are used for charting technique must rely on predefined rules.
History
It is said that Japanese used technical analysis to trade rice in the 17th century. But according to Steve Nison,
candlestick charting came later and probably began sometime after 1850. Much of the credit for candlestick charting
goes to Munehisa Homma who was a rice trader from Sakata.
Formation of candlestick

Chunk 4674 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Formation of candlestick
Candlestick is formed with the help of opening, high, low and closing price of the day. If the opening price is above
the closing price then a filled candlestick is drawn. Normally, black colour is used for filling the candle. If the
closing price is above the opening price, then a hollow candlestick (normally displayed in white with black border) is
drawn. The filled or the hollow portion of the candle is known as body or real body which can be long, normal or

Chunk 4675 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
short with proportionate to the line above or below it. The lines (long or short) above and below the body or real
body represent the high or low price range and these lines are known as shadows, tails or wicks. For the particular
day, the highest price is declared by the top of the upper shadow and the lowest price is marked by the bottom of the
lower tail. Please note that the body may or may not have shadows, tails or wicks.

Doji
The doji is a commonly found pattern in a candlestick chart of financially traded assets (stocks, bonds, futures, etc).
It is characterized by being small in length—meaning a small trading range—with an opening and closing price that
are virtually equal[1] .

Chunk 4697 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
are virtually equal[1] .
The doji represents indecision in the market. A doji is not as significant if the market is not clearly trending, as
non-trending markets are inherently indicative of indecision. If the doji forms in an uptrend or downtrend, this is
normally seen as significant, as it is a signal that the buyers are losing conviction when formed in an uptrend and a
signal that sellers are losing conviction if seen in a downtrend.Doji 90
Types of Doji

Chunk 4698 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Types of Doji
Neutral[2] : Dojis form when the opening and closing prices are virtually equal. Alone,
dojis are neutral patterns.
Long-Legged[3] : This doji reflects a great amount of indecision about the future direction
of the underlying asset.
Doji 91
Gravestone[4] : The long upper shadow suggests that the direction of the trend may be
nearing a major turning point.
Dragonfly[5] : The long lower shadow suggests that the direction of the trend may be
nearing a major turning point.

Hammer (candlestick pattern)
Hammers are found in downtrends
A hammer is a type of bullish reversal candlestick pattern, made up of just one candle, found in price charts of
financial assets. The candle looks like a hammer, as it has a long lower wick and a short body at the top of the

Chunk 4701 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
candlestick with little or no upper wick. In order for a candle to be a valid hammer most traders say the lower wick
must be two times greater than the size of the body portion of the candle, and the body of the candle must be at the
upper end of the trading range.
When you see the hammer form in a downtrend this is a sign of a potential reversal in the market as the long lower

Chunk 4702 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
wick represents a period of trading where the sellers were initially in control but the buyers were able to reverse that
control and drive prices back up to close near the high for the day, thus the short body at the top of the candle.
After seeing this chart pattern form in the market most traders will wait for the next period to open higher than the
close of the previous period to confirm that the buyers are actually in control.

Chunk 4703 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Two additional things that traders will look for to place more significance on the pattern are a long lower wick and
an increase in volume for the time period that formed the hammer.

Inverted hammer
The Inverted Hammer is a type of bullish reversal pattern. As its name implies, the inverted Hammer looks like an
upside down version of the hammer candlestick pattern. Like the hammer candlestick pattern, the Inverted Hammer
consists of one candle and when found in a downtrend is considered a potential reversal pattern.

Chunk 4707 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The pattern is made up of a candle with a small lower body and a long upper wick which is at least two times as
large as the short lower body. The body of the candle should be at the low end of the trading range and there should
be little or no lower wick in the candle.
The long upper wick of the candlestick pattern indicates that the buyers drove prices up at some point during the
period in which the candle was formed but encountered selling pressure which drove prices back down for the period

Chunk 4708 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
to close near to where they opened. As this occurred in an uptrend the selling pressure is seen as a potential reversal

Shooting star (candlestick pattern)
Shooting star patterns are found in uptrends
The shooting star is a type of bearish reversal pattern. The Shooting Star looks exactly the same as the Inverted
hammer, but instead of being found in a downtrend it is found in an uptrend and thus has different implications.
Like the Inverted hammer it is made up of a candle with a small lower body, little or no lower wick, and a long upper
wick that is at least two times the size of the lower body.

Chunk 4710 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The long upper wick of the candlestick pattern indicates that the buyers drove prices up at some point during the
period in which the candle was formed but encountered selling pressure which drove prices back down for the period
to close near to where they opened. As this occurred in an uptrend the selling pressure is seen as a potential reversal
sign. When encountering this pattern traders will look for a lower open on the next period before considering the

Chunk 4711 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
pattern valid and potentially including it in their trading strategy.Shooting star (candlestick pattern) 95
As with the Inverted hammer most traders will see a longer wick as a sign of a greater potential reversal and like to
see an increase in volume on the day the Shooting Star forms.

Marubozu
Marubozu is the name of Japanese candlesticks formation used in technical analysis to indicate a stock has traded
strongly in one direction throughout the session and closed at its high or low price of the day. A marubozu candle is

Chunk 4713 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
represented only by a body; it has no wicks or shadows extending from the top or bottom of the candle. A white
marubozu candle has a long white body and is formed when the open equals the low and the close equals the high.
The white marubozu candle indicates that buyers controlled the price of the stock from the opening bell to the close
of the day, and is considered very bullish.
A black marubozu candle has a long black body and is formed when the open equals the high and the close equals

Chunk 4714 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):

Spinning top (candlestick pattern)
Spinning top is a Japanese candlesticks pattern with a short body found in the middle of two long wicks. A spinning
top is indicative of a situation where neither the buyers nor the sellers have won for that time period, as the market

Chunk 4715 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
has closed relatively unchanged from where it opened; the market is indecisive regarding its trend. The upper and
lower long wicks, however, tell us that both the buyers and the sellers had the upper hand at some point during the
time period the candle represents. When a spinning top forms after a run up or run down in the market, it can be an
indication of a pending reversal, as the indecision in the market is representative of the buyers losing momentum

Chunk 4716 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
when this occurs after an uptrend and the sellers losing momentum after a downtrend.

Three Black Crows
Three black crows is a term used by stock market
analyists to describe a market downturn. It appears on a
candlestick chart in the financial markets. It unfolds
across three trading sessions, and consists of three long
candlesticks that trend downward like a staircase. Each
candle should open below the previous day's open,

candle should open below the previous day's open,
ideally in the middle price range of that previous day.
Each candlestick should also close progressively
downward to establish a new near-term low. The
pattern indicates a strong price reversal from a bull
market to a bear market.[1]
The three black crows help to confirm that a bull
market has ended and market sentiment has turned
negative. In Japanese Candlestick Charting
Techniques, technical analyst Steve Nison says "The

Morning star (candlestick pattern)
Illustration of the morningstar pattern
The Morning Star is a pattern seen in a
candlestick chart, a type of chart used by

Chunk 4725 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
candlestick chart, a type of chart used by
stock analysts to describe and predict price
movements of a security, derivative, or
currency over time.
Description
The pattern is made up of three candles:
normally a long bearish candle, followed by
a short bullish or bearish doji, which is then
followed by a long bullish candle. In order
to have a valid Morning Star formation,
most traders will look for the top of the third candle to be at least half way up the body of the first candle in the

Chunk 4726 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
pattern. Black candles indicate falling prices, and white candles indicate rising prices.
Interpretation
When found in a downtrend, this pattern can be an indication that a reversal in the price trend is going to take place.
What the pattern represents from a supply and demand point of view is a lot of selling in the period which forms the
first black candle; then, a period of lower trading but with a reduced range, which indicates indecision in the market;

Chunk 4727 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
this forms the second candle. This is followed by a large white candle, representing buyers taking control of the
market. As the Morning Star is a three-candle pattern, traders oftentimes will not wait for confirmation from a fourth
candle before buying the stock. High volumes on the third trading day confirm the pattern. Traders will look at the
size of the candles for an indication of the size of the potential reversal. The larger the white and black candle, and

Chunk 4728 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
the higher the white candle moves in relation to the black candle, the larger the potential reversal.
The chart below illustrates.Morning star (candlestick pattern) 100
The Morning Star pattern is circled. Note the high trading volumes on the third day.
The opposite occurring at the top of an uptrend is called an evening star.
Hikkake Pattern
The Hikkake Pattern (also known simply as Hikkake or an inside day false breakout), is a technical analysis

Chunk 4729 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
pattern used for determining market turning-points and continuations. It is a simple pattern that can be observed in
market price data, using traditional bar charts, or Japanese candlestick charts.
Description
The pattern consists of a measurable period of rest and volatility contraction in the market, followed by a relatively
brief price move that encourages unsuspecting traders and investors to adopt a false assumption regarding the likely

Chunk 4730 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
future direction of price. The pattern, once formed, yields its own set of trading parameters for the time and price of
market entry, the dollar risk amount (i.e., where to place protective stops), and the expected profit target. The pattern
is not meant as a stand alone "system" for market speculation, but rather as an ancillary technique to traditional
technical and fundamental market analysis methods.

Chunk 4731 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The pattern is recognised in two variants, one bearish and one bullish. In both variants, the first bar of the pattern is
an inside bar (i.e., one which has both a higher low and a lower high, compared with the previous bar). This is then
followed by either a bar with both higher low and higher high for the bearish variant, or with lower low and lower
high for the bullish variant. Before the pattern produces a trading signal it must be confirmed; this happens when the

Chunk 4732 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
price passes below the low of the first bar of the pattern (in the bearish variant) or above the high of the first bar (in
the bullish variant). Confirmation must occur within three periods of the last bar of the signal for the signal to be
considered valid.Hikkake Pattern 101
Origin
The hikkake pattern was first discovered and introduced to the financial community through a series of published

Chunk 4733 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
articles written by technical analyst.[1] The phrase "Hikkake" is a Japanese verb which means to "trick" or "ensnare."
Notable uses
Due to its popularity among institutional traders, the hikkake pattern has been adopted for use by INSTREAM,[2] the
Nordic power trading software company, in their E2 Energy Market Analysis Platform.
Growing interest in the hikkake pattern among traders and investors has also spawned attention from various book

INDICATORS: Trend
Average Directional Index
The Average Directional Index (ADX) was developed in 1978 by J. Welles Wilder as an indicator of trend strength

Chunk 4736 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
in a series of prices of a financial instrument. ADX has become a widely used indicator for technical analysts, and is
provided as a standard in collections of indicators offered by various trading platforms.
Calculation
The ADX is a combination of two other indicators developed by Wilder, the positive directional indicator
(abbreviated +DI) and negative directional indicator (-DI). The ADX combines them and smooths the result with an
exponential moving average.

Chunk 4737 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
exponential moving average.
To calculate +DI and -DI, one needs price data consisting of high, low, and closing prices each period (typically each
day). One first calculates the Directional Movement (+DM and -DM):
UpMove = Today's High − Yesterday's High
DownMove = Yesterday's Low − Today's Low
if UpMove > DownMove and UpMove > 0, then +DM = UpMove, else +DM = 0
if DownMove > UpMove and DownMove > 0, then -DM = DownMove, else -DM = 0

Chunk 4738 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
After selecting the number of periods (Wilder used 14 days originally), +DI and -DI are:
+DI = 100 times exponential moving average of +DM divided by Average True Range
-DI = 100 times exponential moving average of -DM divided by Average True Range
The exponential moving average is calculated over the number of periods selected, and the average true range is an
exponential average of the true ranges. Then:

Chunk 4739 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
exponential average of the true ranges. Then:
ADX = 100 times the exponential moving average of the Absolute value of (+DI − -DI) divided by (+DI +
-DI)
Variations of this calculation typically involve using different types of moving averages, such as a weighted moving
average or an adaptive moving average.
Interpretation
The ADX does not indicate trend direction, only trend strength. It is a lagging indicator; that is, a trend must have

Chunk 4740 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
established itself before the ADX will generate a signal that a trend is underway. ADX will range between 0 and
100. Generally, ADX readings below 20 indicate trend weakness, and readings above 40 indicate trend strength. An
extremely strong trend is indicated by readings above 50.

Chunk 4741 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Ichimoku Kinkō Hyō
Ichimoku Kinko Hyo (一目均衡表 Ichimoku Kinkō Hyō) usually just called ichimoku is a technical analysis
method that builds on candlestick charting to improve the accuracy of forecasted price moves. It was developed in
the late 1930s by Goichi Hosoda (細田悟一 Hosoda Goichi), a Japanese journalist who used to be known as
Ichimoku Sanjin, which can be translated as "What a man in the mountain sees". He spent thirty years perfecting the

Chunk 4742 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
technique before releasing his findings to the general public in the late 1960s.[1]
Ichimoku Kinko Hyo translates to 'one glance equilibrium chart' or 'instant look at the balance chart' and is
sometimes referred to as 'one glance cloud chart' based on the unique 'clouds' that feature in ichimoku charting.[2]
Ichimoku is a moving average-based trend identification system and because it contains more data points than

Chunk 4743 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
standard candlestick charts, provides a clearer picture of potential price action.[3] The main difference between how
moving averages are plotted in ichimoku as opposed to other methods is that ichimoku's lines are constructed using
the 50% point of the highs and lows as opposed to the candle's closing price.
Ichimoku factors in time as an additional element along with the price action, similar to William Delbert Gann's
trading ideas.

MACD
MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence) is a technical analysis indicator created by Gerald Appel in the
late 1970s.[1] It is used to spot changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend in a stock's
price.

Chunk 4748 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
price.
The MACD is a computation of the difference between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of closing prices.
This difference is charted over time, alongside a moving average of the difference. The divergence between the two
is shown as a histogram or bar graph.
Exponential moving averages highlight recent changes in a stock's price. By comparing EMAs of different periods,
the MACD line illustrates changes in the trend of a stock. Then by comparing that difference to an average, an

Chunk 4749 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
analyst can chart subtle shifts in the stock's trend.
Since the MACD is based on moving averages, it is inherently a lagging indicator. As a metric of price trends, the
MACD is less useful for stocks that are not trending or are trading erratically.
Note that the term "MACD" is used both generally, to refer to the indicator as a whole, and specifically, to the
MACD line itself.
Basic components
MACD 12,26,9

Chunk 4750 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
MACD line itself.
Basic components
MACD 12,26,9
The graph above shows a stock with a MACD indicator underneath it. The indicator shows a blue line, a red line,
and a histogram or bar chart which calculates the difference between the two lines. Values are calculated from the
price of the stock in the main part of the graph.
For the example above this means:
•MACD line (blue line): difference between the 12 and 26 days EMAs
•signal (red line): 9 day EMA of the blue line

Chunk 4751 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
•signal (red line): 9 day EMA of the blue line
•histogram (bar graph): difference between the blue and red lines
Mathematically:MACD 105
•MACD = EMA[fast,12] – EMA[slow, 26]
•signal = EMA[period,9] of MACD
•histogram = MACD – signal
The period for the moving averages on which an MACD is based can vary, but the most commonly used parameters
involve a faster EMA of 12 days, a slower EMA of 26 days, and the signal line as a 9 day EMA of the difference

Chunk 4752 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
between the two. It is written in the form, MACD(faster, slower, signal) or in this case, MACD(12,26,9).
Interpretation
Exponential moving averages highlight recent changes in a stock's price. By comparing EMAs of different lengths,
the MACD line gauges changes in the trend of a stock. By then comparing differences in the change of that line to an
average, an analyst can identify subtle shifts in the strength and direction of a stock's trend.

Chunk 4753 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Traders recognize three meaningful signals generated by the MACD indicator.
When:
•the MACD line crosses the signal line
•the MACD line crosses zero
•there is a divergence between the MACD line and the price of the stock or between the histogram and the price of
the stock
Graphically this corresponds to:
•the blue line crossing the red line
•the blue line crossing the x-axis (the straight black line in the middle of the indicator)

Chunk 4754 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
•higher highs (lower lows) on the price graph but not on the blue line, or higher highs (lower lows) on the price
graph but not on the bar graph
And mathematically:
•MACD – signal = 0
•EMA[fast,12] – EMA[slow,26] = 0
•Sign (relative price extremumfinal – relative price extremuminitial) ≠ Sign (relative MACD extremumfinal –
MACD extremuminitial)
Signal line crossover
Signal line crossovers are the primary cues provided by the MACD. The standard interpretation is to buy when the

Chunk 4755 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
MACD line crosses up through the signal line, or sell when it crosses down through the signal line.
The upwards move is called a bullish crossover and the downwards move a bearish crossover. Respectively, they
indicate that the trend in the stock is about to accelerate in the direction of the crossover.
The histogram shows when a crossing occurs. Since the histogram is the difference between the MACD line and the
signal line, when they cross there is no difference between them.

Chunk 4756 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The histogram can also help in visualizing when the two lines are approaching a crossover. Though it may show a
difference, the changing size of the difference can indicate the acceleration of a trend. A narrowing histogram
suggests a crossover may be approaching, and a widening histogram suggests that an ongoing trend is likely to get
even stronger.
While it is theoretically possible for a trend to increase indefinitely, under normal circumstances, even stocks

Chunk 4757 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
moving drastically will eventually slow down, lest they go up to infinity or down to nothing.MACD 106
Zero crossover
A crossing of the MACD line through zero happens when there is no difference between the fast and slow EMAs. A
move from positive to negative is bearish and from negative to positive, bullish. Zero crossovers provide evidence of
a change in the direction of a trend but less confirmation of its momentum than a signal line crossover.
Divergence

Chunk 4758 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Divergence
The third cue, divergence, refers to a discrepancy between the MACD line and the graph of the stock price. Positive
divergence between the MACD and price arises when price hits a new low, but the MACD doesn't. This is
interpreted as bullish, suggesting the downtrend may be nearly over. Negative divergence is when the stock price hits
a new high but the MACD does not. This is interpreted as bearish, suggesting that recent price increases will not
continue.

Chunk 4759 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
continue.
Divergence may also occur between the stock price and the histogram. If new high price levels are not confirmed by
new high histogram levels, it is considered bearish; alternately, if new low price levels are not confirmed by new low
histogram levels, it is considered bullish.
Longer and sharper divergences—distinct peaks or troughs—are regarded as more significant than small, shallow
patterns.
Timing

Chunk 4760 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
patterns.
Timing
The MACD is only as useful as the context in which it is applied. An analyst might apply the MACD to a weekly
scale before looking at a daily scale, in order to avoid making short term trades against the direction of the
intermediate trend.[2] Analysts will also vary the parameters of the MACD to track trends of varying duration. One
popular short-term set-up, for example, is the (5,35,5).
False signals

Chunk 4761 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
False signals
Like any indicator, the MACD can generate false signals. A false positive, for example, would be a bullish crossover
followed by a sudden decline in a stock. A false negative would be a situation where there was no bullish crossover,
yet the stock accelerated suddenly upwards.
A prudent strategy would be to apply a filter to signal line crossovers to ensure that they will hold. An example of a

Chunk 4762 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
price filter would be to buy if the MACD line breaks above the signal line and then remains above it for three days.
As with any filtering strategy, this reduces both the probability of false signals as well as the frequency of missed
profit.
Analysts use a variety of approaches to filter out false signals and confirm true ones. As a lagging indicator, the
MACD is often paired with a leading indicator, like the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Historical comparisons to

Chunk 4763 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
similar stocks as well as a careful investigation of past price movements provide added information about how a
stock tends to move.MACD 107
Limitations
The MACD has often been criticized for failing to respond in very low or alternately very high volatility market
conditions.[3] Since the MACD measures the divergence between averages, it can give meaningful feedback only as
trends change. Thus, the MACD is less useful if the market is not trending, that is, if it is trading sideways, or if the

Chunk 4764 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
market is trading erratically, making sudden, dramatic, or countervailing moves.
In a sideways market, the divergence between averages will not have a trend to illuminate. In an erratic market, the
changes will happen too quickly to be picked up by moving averages or will cancel each other out, diminishing the
MACDs usefulness. A partial caveat to this criticism is that whether a market is trending or volatile is always

Chunk 4765 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
relative to a particular timeframe, and the MACD can be adjusted to shorter or longer spans.
Finally, though some analysts trade on technical indicators alone, the abundance of experts recommend a complete
work-up of a company's business sectors, financial strength, past earnings, new products, management, and
institutional buying. For more traditional investors, an indicator like the MACD may be used only to support a

Chunk 4766 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
previously determined stock choice, or to select an ideal entry-point into a fundamentally sound stock.
Oscillator classification
The MACD is an absolute price oscillator (APO), because it deals with the actual prices of moving averages rather
than percentage changes. A percentage price oscillator (PPO), on the other hand, computes the difference between
two moving averages of price divided by the longer moving average value.

Chunk 4767 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
While an APO will show greater levels for higher priced securities and smaller levels for lower priced securities, a
PPO calculates changes relative to price. Subsequently, a PPO is preferred when: comparing oscillator values
between different securities, especially those with substantially different prices; or comparing oscillator values for
the same security at significantly different times, especially a security whose value has changed greatly.

Chunk 4768 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
A third member of the price oscillator family is the detrended price oscillator (DPO), which ignores long term trends
while emphasizing short term patterns.
Signal processing theory
In signal processing terms, the MACD is a filtered measure of velocity. The velocity has been passed through two
first-order linear low pass filters. The "signal line" is that resulting velocity, filtered again. The difference between

Chunk 4769 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
those two, the histogram, is a measure of the acceleration, with all three filters applied. An MACD crossover of the
signal line indicates that the direction of the acceleration is changing. The MACD line crossing zero suggests that the
average velocity is changing direction.
History
The MACD was invented by Gerald Appel in the 1970's. Thomas Aspray added a histogram to the MACD in 1986,
as a means to anticipate MACD crossovers, an indicator of important moves in the underlying security.

Mass index

Chunk 4772 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Mass index
The mass index is an indicator, developed by Donald Dorsey, used in technical analysis to predict trend reversals. It
is based on the notion that there is a tendency for reversal when the price range widens, and therefore compares
previous trading ranges (highs minus lows).
Mass index for a commodity is obtained[1] by calculating its exponential moving average over a 9 day period and the

Chunk 4773 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
exponential moving average of this average (a "double" average), and summing the ratio of these two over a given
amount of days (usually 25).
Generally the EMA and the re-smoothed EMA of EMA are fairly close, making their ratio is roughly 1 and the sum
around 25.
According to Dorsey, a so-called "reversal bulge" is a probable signal of trend reversal (regardless of the trend's
direction).[2] Such a bulge takes place when a 25-day mass index reaches 27.0 and then falls to below 26 (or 26.5). A

Chunk 4774 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
9-day prime moving average is usually used to determine whether the bulge is a buy or sell signal.
This formula uses intraday range values: not the "true range," which adjusts for full and partial gaps. Also, the

Moving average
In statistics, a moving average, also called rolling average, rolling mean or running average, is a type of finite
impulse response filter used to analyze a set of data points by creating a series of averages of different subsets of the
full data set.

Chunk 4776 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
full data set.
Given a series of numbers and a fixed subset size, the moving average can be obtained by first taking the average of
the first subset. The fixed subset size is then shifted forward, creating a new subset of numbers, which is averaged.
This process is repeated over the entire data series. The plot line connecting all the (fixed) averages is the moving
average. Thus, a moving average is not a single number, but it is a set of numbers, each of which is the average of

Chunk 4777 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
the corresponding subset of a larger set of data points. A moving average may also use unequal weights for each data
value in the subset to emphasize particular values in the subset.
A moving average is commonly used with time series data to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight
longer-term trends or cycles. The threshold between short-term and long-term depends on the application, and the

Chunk 4778 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
parameters of the moving average will be set accordingly. For example, it is often used in technical analysis of
financial data, like stock prices, returns or trading volumes. It is also used in economics to examine gross domestic
product, employment or other macroeconomic time series. Mathematically, a moving average is a type of
convolution and so it is also similar to the low-pass filter used in signal processing. When used with non-time series

data, a moving average simply acts as a generic smoothing operation without any specific connection to time,
although typically some kind of ordering is implied.
Simple moving average
A simple moving average (SMA) is the unweighted mean of the previous n data points. For example, a 10-day
simple moving average of closing price is the mean of the previous 10 days' closing prices. If those prices are
then the formula is

Chunk 4780 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
then the formula is
When calculating successive values, a new value comes into the sum and an old value drops out, meaning a full
summation each time is unnecessary,
In technical analysis there are various popular values for n, like 10 days, 40 days, or 200 days. The period selected
depends on the kind of movement one is concentrating on, such as short, intermediate, or long term. In any case
moving average levels are interpreted as support in a rising market, or resistance in a falling market.

Chunk 4781 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
In all cases a moving average lags behind the latest data point, simply from the nature of its smoothing. An SMA can
lag to an undesirable extent, and can be disproportionately influenced by old data points dropping out of the average.
This is addressed by giving extra weight to more recent data points, as in the weighted and exponential moving
averages.
One characteristic of the SMA is that if the data have a periodic fluctuation, then applying an SMA of that period

Chunk 4782 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
will eliminate that variation (the average always containing one complete cycle). But a perfectly regular cycle is
rarely encountered in economics or finance.[1]
For a number of applications it is advantageous to avoid the shifting induced by using only 'past' data. Hence a
central moving average can be computed, using both 'past' and 'future' data. The 'future' data in this case are not

predictions, but merely data obtained after the time at which the average is to be computed.Moving average 110
Cumulative moving average
The cumulative moving average is also frequently called a running average or a long running average although the
term running average is also used as synonym for a moving average. This article uses the term cumulative moving
average or simply cumulative average since this term is more descriptive and unambiguous.

Chunk 4784 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
In some data acquisition systems, the data arrives in an ordered data stream and the statistician would like to get the
average of all of the data up until the current data point. For example, an investor may want the average price of all
of the stock transactions for a particular stock up until the current time. As each new transaction occurs, the average
price at the time of the transaction can be calculated for all of the transactions up to that point using the cumulative

Chunk 4785 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
average. This is the cumulative average, which is typically an unweighted average of the sequence of i values x1, ...,
xi up to the current time:
The brute force method to calculate this would be to store all of the data and calculate the sum and divide by the
number of data points every time a new data point arrived. However, it is possible to simply update cumulative
average as a new value xi+1 becomes available, using the formula:
where CA0 can be taken to be equal to 0.

Chunk 4786 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
where CA0 can be taken to be equal to 0.
Thus the current cumulative average for a new data point is equal to the previous cumulative average plus the
difference between the latest data point and the previous average divided by the number of points received so far.
When all of the data points arrive (i = N), the cumulative average will equal the final average.
The derivation of the cumulative average formula is straightforward. Using
and similarly for i + 1, it is seen that

Chunk 4787 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
and similarly for i + 1, it is seen that
Solving this equation for CAi+1 results in:
Weighted moving average
A weighted average is any average that has multiplying factors to give different weights to different data points.
Mathematically, the moving average is the convolution of the data points with a moving average function; in
technical analysis, a weighted moving average (WMA) has the specific meaning of weights that decrease

Chunk 4788 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
arithmetically. In an n-day WMA the latest day has weight n, the second latest n − 1, etc, down to one.
Moving average 111
WMA weights n = 15
The denominator is a triangle number, and can be easily computed as 
When calculating the WMA across successive values, it can be noted the difference between the numerators of
WMAM+1 and WMAM is npM+1 − pM − ... − pM−n+1. If we denote the sum pM + ... + pM−n+1 by TotalM, then

Chunk 4789 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The graph at the right shows how the weights decrease, from highest weight for the most recent data points, down to
zero. It can be compared to the weights in the exponential moving average which follows.
Exponential moving average
EMA weights N=15
An exponential moving average (EMA), also known as an
exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA),[2] is a type of
infinite impulse response filter that applies weighting factors which
decrease exponentially. The weighting for each older data point

Chunk 4790 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
decreases exponentially, never reaching zero. The graph at right shows
an example of the weight decrease.
The formula for calculating the EMA at time periods t > 2 is
Where:
•The coefficient α represents the degree of weighting decrease, a constant smoothing factor between 0 and 1. A
higher α discounts older observations faster. Alternatively, α may be expressed in terms of N time periods, where

Chunk 4791 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
α = 2/(N+1). For example, N = 19 is equivalent to α = 0.1. The half-life of the weights (the interval over which the
weights decrease by a factor of two) is approximately N/2.8854 (within 1% if N > 5).
•Yt is the observation at a time period t.
•St' is the value of the EMA at any time period t.
S1 is undefined. S2 may be initialized in a number of different ways, most commonly by setting S2 to Y1, though

Chunk 4792 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
other techniques exist, such as setting S2 to an average of the first 4 or 5 observations. The prominence of the S2 
initialization's effect on the resultant moving average depends on α; smaller α values make the choice of S2 relativelyMoving average 112
more important than larger α values, since a higher α discounts older observations faster.
This formulation is according to Hunter (1986)[3] . By repeated application of this formula for different times, we can

Chunk 4793 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
eventually write St as a weighted sum of the data points Yt, as:
for any suitable k = 0, 1, 2, ... The weight of the general data point is .
An alternate approach by Roberts (1959) uses Yt in lieu of Yt−1[4] :
This formula can also be expressed in technical analysis terms as follows, showing how the EMA steps towards the
latest data point, but only by a proportion of the difference (each time):[5]
Expanding out each time results in the following power series, showing how the weighting factor on

Chunk 4794 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
each data point p1, p2, etc, decreases exponentially:
[6]
This is an infinite sum with decreasing terms.
The N periods in an N-day EMA only specify the α factor. N is not a stopping point for the calculation in the way it
is in an SMA or WMA. For sufficiently large N, The first N data points in an EMA represent about 86% of the total
weight in the calculation[7] :

The power formula above gives a starting value for a particular day, after which the successive days formula shown
first can be applied. The question of how far back to go for an initial value depends, in the worst case, on the data. If
there are huge p price values in old data then they'll have an effect on the total even if their weighting is very small.
If one assumes prices don't vary too wildly then just the weighting can be considered. The weight omitted by

terms should be used. Since approaches as N increases[9] , this simplifies to approximately[10]Moving average 113
for this example (99.9% weight).

as:

A further weighting, used by actuaries, is Spencer's 15-Point Moving Average[11] (a central moving average). The
symmetric weight coefficients are -3, -6, -5, 3, 21, 46, 67, 74, 67, 46, 21, 3, -5, -6, -3.
Moving median
From a statistical point of view, the moving average, when used to estimate the underlying trend in a time series, is

Chunk 4800 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
susceptible to rare events such as rapid shocks or other anomalies. A more robust estimate of the trend is the simple
moving median over n time points:
where the median is found by, for example, sorting the values inside the brackets and finding the value in the middle.
Statistically, the moving average is optimal for recovering the underlying trend of the time series when the 
fluctuations about the trend are normally distributed. However, the normal distribution does not place high

Chunk 4801 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
probability on very large deviations from the trend which explains why such deviations will have a 
disproportionately large effect on the trend estimate. It can be shown that if the fluctuations are instead assumed to 
be Laplace distributed, then the moving median is statistically optimal[12] . For a given variance, the Laplace 
distribution places higher probability on rare events than does the normal, which explains why the moving medianMoving average 114

Chunk 4802 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
tolerates shocks better than the moving mean.
When the simple moving median above is central, the smoothing is identical to the median filter which has
applications in, for example, image signal processing.

,Parabolic SAR 115
Parabolic SAR
Parabolic SAR for Ebay during 2002.
In the field of technical analysis,
Parabolic SAR (SAR - stop and
reverse) is a method devised by J.
Welles Wilder, Jr., to find trends in
market prices or securities. It may be
used as a trailing stop loss based on

Chunk 4807 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
used as a trailing stop loss based on
prices tending to stay within a
parabolic curve during a strong trend.
The concept draws on the idea that
time is the enemy (similar to option
theory's concept of time decay), and
unless a security can continue to
generate more profits over time, it
should be liquidated. The indicator
generally works well in trending
markets, but provides "whipsaws" during non-trending, sideways phases; as such, Wilder recommended establishing

Chunk 4808 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
the strength and direction of the trend first through the use of things such as the Average Directional Index, and then
using the Parabolic SAR to trade that trend.
A parabola below the price is generally bullish, while a parabola above is generally bearish.
Construction
The Parabolic SAR is calculated almost independently for each trend in the price. When the price is in an uptrend,
the SAR appears below the price and converges upwards towards it. Similarly, on a downtrend, the SAR appears

Chunk 4809 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
above the price and converges downwards.
At each step within a trend, the SAR is calculated ahead of time. That is, tomorrow's SAR value is built using data
available today. The general formula used for this is:
Where and represent today's and tomorrow's SAR values, respectively.
The extreme point, , is a record kept during each trend that represents the highest value reached by the price

Chunk 4810 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
during the current uptrend — or lowest value during a downtrend. On each period, if a new maximum (or minimum)
is observed, the EP is updated with that value.
The value represents the acceleration factor. Usually, this is set to a value of 0.02 initially. This factor is
increased by 0.02 each time a new EP is recorded. In other words, each time a new EP is observed, it will increase
the acceleration factor. This will then quicken the rate at which the SAR converges towards the price. To keep it

Chunk 4811 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
from getting too large, a maximum value for the acceleration factor is normally set at 0.20, so that it never goes
beyond that. For stocks trading, it is preferable to set the acceleration factor to 0.01, in order to be less sensitive to
local decreases. For commodity or currency trading, it is preferable to use a value of 0.02.
The SAR is iteratively calculated for each new period using this recursive definition. There are, however, two special
cases that will modify the SAR value:

Chunk 4812 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
cases that will modify the SAR value:
•If tomorrow's SAR value lies within (or beyond) today's or yesterday's price range, the SAR must be set to the
closest price bound. For example, if in an uptrend, the new SAR value is calculated and it results to be greater
than today's or yesterday's lowest price, the SAR must be set equal to that lower boundary.Parabolic SAR 116
•If tomorrow's SAR value lies within (or beyond) tomorrow's price range, a new trend direction is then signaled,

Chunk 4813 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
and the SAR must "switch sides."
Upon a trend switch, several things happen. The first SAR value for this new trend is set to the last EP recorded on
the previous trend. The EP is then reset accordingly to this period's maximum. The acceleration factor is reset to its
initial value of 0.02.

Trix (technical analysis)

Chunk 4815 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Trix (technical analysis)
Trix (or TRIX) is a technical analysis oscillator developed in the 1980s by Jack Hutson, editor of Technical
Analysis of Stocks and Commodities magazine. It shows the slope (i.e. derivative) of a triple-smoothed exponential
moving average. The name Trix is from "triple exponential."
Trix is calculated with a given N-day period as follows:
•Smooth prices (often closing prices) using an N-day exponential moving average (EMA).
•Smooth that series using another N-day EMA.

Chunk 4816 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
•Smooth that series using another N-day EMA.
•Smooth a third time, using a further N-day EMA.
•Calculate the percentage difference between today's and yesterday's value in that final smoothed series.
Like any moving average, the triple EMA is just a smoothing of price data and therefore is trend-following. A rising
or falling line is an uptrend or downtrend and Trix shows the slope of that line, so it's positive for a steady uptrend,

Chunk 4817 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
negative for a downtrend, and a crossing through zero is a trend-change, i.e. a peak or trough in the underlying
average.
The triple-smoothed EMA is very different from a plain EMA. In a plain EMA the latest few days dominate and the
EMA follows recent prices quite closely; however, applying it three times results in weightings spread much more
broadly, and the weights for the latest few days are in fact smaller than those of days further past. The following

Chunk 4818 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
graph shows the weightings for an N=10 triple EMA (most recent days at the left):Trix (technical analysis) 117
Triple exponential moving average weightings, N=10 (percentage versus days ago)
Note that the distribution's mode will
lie with pN-2's weight, i.e. in the graph
above p8 carries the highest weighting.
An N of 1 is invalid.
The easiest way to calculate the triple EMA based on successive values is just to apply the EMA three times,

Chunk 4819 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
creating single-, then double-, then triple-smoothed series. The triple EMA can also be expressed directly in terms of
the prices as below, with today's close, yesterday's, etc., and with (as for a
plain EMA):
The coefficients are the triangle numbers, n(n+1)/2. In theory, the sum is infinite, using all past data, but as f is less
than 1 the powers become smaller as the series progresses, and they decrease faster than the coefficients

Vortex Indicator
The Vortex Indicator is a technical indicator invented by Etienne Botes and Douglas Siepman to identify the start
of a new trend or the continuation of an existing trend within financial markets. It was published in the January 2010

Chunk 4821 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
edition of Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities.[1]
Inspiration
The Vortex Indicator was inspired by the work of an Austrian inventor, Viktor Schauberger, who studied the flow of
water in rivers and turbines. Etienne Botes and Douglas Siepman developed the idea that movements and flows
within financial markets are similar to the vortex motions found in water. The Vortex Indicator was also partly

Chunk 4822 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
inspired by J. Welles Wilder's concept of directional movement, which assumes the relationship between price bars
gives clues as to the direction of a market.[2]
Description
A vortex pattern may be observed in any market by connecting the lows of that market’s price bars with the
consecutive bars’ highs, and then price bar highs with consecutive lows. The greater the distance between the low of

Chunk 4823 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
a price bar and the subsequent bar’s high, the greater the upward or positive Vortex movement (VM+). Similarly, the
greater the distance between a price bar’s high and the subsequent bar’s low, the greater the downward or negative
Vortex movement (VM-).
A Vortex Pattern in the Market: By connecting the lows of price bars with the consecutive bars’ highs, and then price bar highs with consecutive
lows, one can observe a vortex pattern in the market.

Chunk 4824 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The Vortex Indicator: The greater the distance between the low of a price bar and the subsequent bar’s high, the stronger the positive Vortex
movement (VM+). Similarly, the greater the distance between a price bar’s high and the subsequent bar’s low, the stronger the negative Vortex
movement (VM-).Vortex Indicator 119
Identifying a trend
On a chart, VI+ and VI- will be seen to intersect each other at a change of trend, and begin to diverge ever wider as

Chunk 4825 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
the strength of a trend increases. When VI+ is larger and above VI-, the market is trending up. Conversely, when VI-
is bigger and above VI+, the market is trending down.
A trader should focus on the key trend change points of the Vortex Indicator (i.e. the crossing points of VI+ and
VI-). When VI+ crosses above VI-, a long (buy) position is indicated. A short or sell position is suggested when VI-
crosses above VI+.

Chunk 4826 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
crosses above VI+.
The published article also suggested further measures to ensure an effective trading strategy, for example, only
entering a trade at the extreme high or low of the price bar that corresponds with a crossing of the Vortex
Indicator.[3]
14-Period Daily Vortex Indicator: When VI+ is greater than VI-, it indicates that the market is trending up. The market is trending down when

Chunk 4827 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
VI- is above VI+. The potential change of trend points are found where VI+ and VI- intersect one another.
Price Chart: As the trend strengthens, notice how the VI+ and VI- lines increasingly diverge. As the trend weakens, you will observe the two lines
converging again.
Calculation
The high, low and close values are required for any chosen stock, future, commodity or currency. These values may
be 15-minute, hourly, daily, etc.
•First, calculate the current True Range:

Chunk 4828 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
•First, calculate the current True Range: 
•Current True Range (TR) = Maximum absolute value of either (Current High-Current Low), (Current
Low-Previous Close), (Current High-Previous Close)
•Next, calculate the current upward (positive) and downward (negative) Vortex movements: 
•Current Vortex Movement Up (VM+) = Absolute value of Current High – Previous Low
•Current Vortex Movement Down (VM-) = Absolute Value of Current Low – Previous HighVortex Indicator 120

Chunk 4829 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
•Decide on a parameter length (21 periods was used for this example). Now, sum the last 21 period’s True
Range, VM+ and VM-:
•Sum of the last 21 periods’ True Range = SUM TR21
•Sum of the last 21 periods’ VM+ = SUM VM21+
•Sum of the last 21 periods’ VM- = SUM VM21-
•Finally, divide SUM VM21+ and SUM VM21- respectively with the SUM TR21 to obtain the Vortex
Indicator:
•SUM VM21+/SUM TR21 = VI21+
•SUM VM21-/SUM TR21 = VI21-

Chunk 4830 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
•SUM VM21-/SUM TR21 = VI21-
If this process is repeated, the resulting VI21+ and VI21- can be drawn graphically to represent the two lines of the
Vortex Indicator.
Practical application
The Vortex Indicator is simple to use as the only required inputs are the high, low and close of a price bar. Traders
may use the Vortex Indicator on its own, in combination with other technical indicators to confirm a change of trend
or as part of a larger trading system.

Chunk 4831 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
or as part of a larger trading system.
In addition, the Vortex Indicator may be used for any:
•market (such as stocks, futures or currencies)
•time frame (for example, 15 minute, hourly or weekly charts)
•parameter (such as 13, 21 or 34 periods)
The inventors of the Vortex Indicator recommend using longer time frames and parameters in order to filter out false
signals. If a trader does opt to use a very short time frame, such as 5 minutes, this should be combined with a long

Chunk 4832 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
parameter of 34 or 55 periods.
Because of its universal applicability, the Vortex Indicator is suitable for both short term traders as well as longer
term fund managers who may wish to identify larger macro trends within a market.
Coding and strategies
The Vortex Indicator is available on most charting software.[4] Some of these companies have suggested additional
trading strategies to use in conjunction with the Vortex Indicator, including the implementation of a trailing stop [5]

and making use of supporting indicators in order to reduce the number of false signals.[6]
Comparative studies
To test the Vortex Indicator against Welles Wilder’s Directional Movement Indicator (DMI), a portfolio of 38 of the
most actively traded, full sized, futures contracts was created. These 38 futures included a number of index and
financial futures, currencies, metals, energy futures and commodities like grains, oils and foods. The test period was

Chunk 4834 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
from 3 January 1978 to 6 November 2009, using a 14 day parameter for both indicators. Over the entire test period,
and also during the last 10 years, the Vortex Indicator showed a better performance than the DMI.[7]
However, using a similar test based on 101 NASDAQ stocks, on a smaller sample (for the period 2 January 1992 to
14 August 2009), the DMI showed a better performance than the Vortex Indicator.[8]Vortex Indicator 121

An alternative version of the indicator was created by Jez Liberty.[9] This version enables the calculation to account
for gap days which sometimes occur in non-continuous markets such as stocks.[10]

Know Sure Thing (KST) Oscillator
Know Sure Thing (KST) Oscillator is a complex, smoothed price velocity indicator developed by Martin J. Pring.[1]

Chunk 4840 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):

Rate of Change (ROC) indicator is the foundation of KST indicator. KST indicator is useful to identify major stock
market cycle junctures because it formula is weighed to have larger influence by the longer and more dominant time
span to better reflecting the primary swings of stock market cycle.[3] . The concept behind the oscillator is that price
trends are determined by the interaction of many different time cycles and that important trend reversals take place

Chunk 4841 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
when a number of price trends are simultaneously changing direction.
Formula
Four different rates of change are calculated, smoothed, multiplied by weights and then summed to form one
indicator.[4]
Where Price refers to current closing price and Price(X1) refers to the closing price X1 bars ago.
Where MOV(ROC1,AVG1) refers to the AVG1 day moving average for ROC1
For Short term trend, Martin J Pring suggest the following parameters:Know Sure Thing (KST) Oscillator 122
X1 = 10
X2 = 15
X3 = 20

The formula is built into, or can be included into various technical analysis softwares like MetaStock[5] or
OmniTrader[6] .
Implications

When KST crosses below its 8 day exponential average, short at the next day opening price.

When KST crosses above its 8 day exponential average, close short position at the next day opening price.[4]
Variations

Chunk 4843 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Variations
It can be calculated on daily[7] or long term[8] basis.
The dominant time frame in the Know Sure Thing (KST)'s construction is a 24-month period, which is half of the
4-year business cycle. This means that the Know Sure Thing (KST) will work best when the security in question is
experiencing a primary up- and downtrend based on the business cycle.[4]
KST Interpretation
KST can be interpreted in the ways mentioned below.[7]

Chunk 4844 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The dominant time frame in the Know Sure Thing (KST)'s construction is a 24-month period, which is half of the

Directional Changes and Moving Average Crossovers
You’ve discovered how changes in direction are the way the KST triggers signals, but also that moving average

Chunk 4845 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
crossovers offer less timely, but more reliable signals. The average to use is a simple 10-day moving average. It is
possible to anticipate a moving average crossover if the KST has already turned and the price violates a trendline.
The KST started to reverse to the downside before the up trendline was violated. Since either a reversal or a trading
range follow a valid trendline violation, it’s evident that upside momentum has temporarily dissipated, causing the

Chunk 4846 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
KST to cross below its moving average.Know Sure Thing (KST) Oscillator 123
Traditionally, the MACD gives buy and sell signals when it crosses above and below its exponential moving
average, known as the “signal line”. This approach isn’t perfect; the ellipses on the chart highlight all the whipsaws.
As said earlier, the KST can also give false or misleading signals, as you can see from the April 2005 buy signal. It

Chunk 4847 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
comes close to a couple of whipsaws, but by and large, it’s more accurate, even though the MACD often turns faster
than the KST.
Overbought/Oversold and Divergences
The concept is that when the indicator crosses above and below the overbought/oversold zones, momentum buy and
sell signals are triggered. Even so, you must wait for some kind of trend reversal signal in the price, such as a price
pattern completion, trendline violation, or similar.

Chunk 4848 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The KST often diverges positively and negatively with the price.
Trendline Violations and Price Pattern Completions
It is possible to construct a trendline on the KST and see when it’s been violated, but not very often. When it does
though, it usually results in a powerful signal.

INDICATORS: Momentum
Momentum (finance)
In finance, momentum is the empirically observed tendency for rising asset prices to rise further. For instance, it
was shown that stocks with strong past performance continue to outperform stocks with poor past performance in the
next period with an average excess return of about 1% per month (Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993, 1999).

Chunk 4853 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The existence of momentum is a market anomaly, which finance theory struggles to explain. The difficulty is that an
increase in asset prices, in and of itself, should not warrant further increase. Such increase, according to the
efficient-market hypothesis, is warranted only by changes in demand and supply or new information (cf.
fundamental analysis). Students of financial economics have largely attributed the appearance of momentum to

Chunk 4854 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
cognitive biases, which belong in the realm of behavioral economics. The explanation is that investors are irrational
(Daniel, Hirschleifer, and Subrahmanyam, 1998 and Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1998), in that they underreact to
new information by failing to incorporate news in their transaction prices. However, much as in the case of price
bubbles, recent research has argued that momentum can be observed even with perfectly rational traders (Crombez,
2001).

Relative Strength Index
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a technical indicator used in the technical analysis of financial markets. It is

Chunk 4857 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
intended to chart the current and historical strength or weakness of a stock or market based on the closing prices of a
recent trading period. The indicator should not be confused with relative strength.
The RSI is classified as a momentum oscillator, measuring the velocity and magnitude of directional price
movements. Momentum is the rate of the rise or fall in price. The RSI computes momentum as the ratio of higher

Chunk 4858 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
closes to lower closes: stocks which have had more or stronger positive changes have a higher RSI than stocks which
have had more or stronger negative changes.
The RSI is most typically used on a 14 day timeframe, measured on a scale from 0 to 100, with high and low levels
marked at 70 and 30, respectively. Shorter or longer timeframes are used for alternately shorter or longer outlooks.
More extreme high and low levels—80 and 20, or 90 and 10—occur less frequently but indicate stronger

Chunk 4859 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
momentum.
The Relative Strength Index was developed by J. Welles Wilder and published in a 1978 book, New Concepts in
Technical Trading Systems, and in Commodities magazine (now Futures magazine) in the June 1978 issue.[1]
Calculation
For each trading period an upward change U or downward change D is calculated. Up periods are characterized by
the close being higher than the previous close:

Chunk 4860 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
the close being higher than the previous close:
Conversely, a down period is characterized by the close being lower than the previous period's (note that D is
nonetheless a positive number),
If the last close is the same as the previous, both U and D are zero. The average U and D are calculated using an
n-period exponential moving average (EMA). The ratio of these averages is the Relative Strength:
If the average of D values is zero, then the RSI value is defined as 100.

Chunk 4861 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The Relative Strength is then converted to a Relative Strength Index between 0 and 100:
The exponential moving averages should be appropriately initialized with a simple averages using the first n values
in the price series.Relative Strength Index 126
Interpretation
Basic configuration
Relative Strength Index 14-period
The RSI is presented on a graph above
or below the price chart. The indicator
has an upper line, typically at 70, a
lower line at 30, and a dashed mid-line

Chunk 4862 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
lower line at 30, and a dashed mid-line
at 50. Wilder recommended a
smoothing period of 14 (see EMA
smoothing, i.e. α = 1/14 or N = 27).
Principles
Wilder posited that when price moves
up very rapidly, at some point it is
considered overbought. Likewise,
when price falls very rapidly, at some
point it is considered oversold. In
either case, Wilder deemed a reaction
or reversal imminent.

Chunk 4863 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
or reversal imminent.
The level of the RSI is a measure of the stock's recent trading strength. The slope of the RSI is directly proportional
to the velocity of a change in the trend. The distance traveled by the RSI is proportional to the magnitude of the
move.
Wilder believed that tops and bottoms are indicated when RSI goes above 70 or drops below 30. Traditionally, RSI
readings greater than the 70 level are considered to be in overbought territory, and RSI readings lower than the 30

Chunk 4864 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
level are considered to be in oversold territory. In between the 30 and 70 level is considered neutral, with the 50 level
a sign of no trend.
Divergence
Wilder further believed that divergence between RSI and price action is a very strong indication that a market
turning point is imminent. Bearish divergence occurs when price makes a new high but the RSI makes a lower high,
thus failing to confirm. Bullish divergence occurs when price makes a new low but RSI makes a higher low.

Chunk 4865 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Overbought and oversold conditions
Wilder thought that "failure swings" above 70 and below 30 on the RSI are strong indications of market reversals.
For example, assume the RSI hits 76, pulls back to 72, then rises to 77. If it falls below 72, Wilder would consider
this a "failure swing" above 70.
Finally, Wilder wrote that chart formations and areas of support and resistance could sometimes be more easily seen

Chunk 4866 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
on the RSI chart as opposed to the price chart. The center line for the relative strength index is 50, which is often
seen as both the support and resistance line for the indicator.
If the relative strength index is below 50, it generally means that the stock's losses are greater than the gains. When
the relative strength index is above 50, it generally means that the gains are greater than the losses.Relative Strength Index 127
Uptrends and downtrends

Chunk 4867 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Uptrends and downtrends
In addition to Wilder's original theories of RSI interpretation, Andrew Cardwell has developed several new
interpretations of RSI to help determine and confirm trend. First, Cardwell noticed that uptrends generally traded
between RSI 40 and 80, while downtrends usually traded between RSI 60 and 20. Cardwell observed when securities
change from uptrend to downtrend and vice versa, the RSI will undergo a "range shift."
Example of RSI Indicator Divergence

Chunk 4868 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Example of RSI Indicator Divergence
Next, Cardwell noted that bearish
divergence: 1) only occurs in uptrends,
and 2) mostly only leads to a brief
correction instead of a reversal in
trend. Therefore bearish divergence is
a sign confirming an uptrend.
Similarly, bullish divergence is a sign
confirming a downtrend.
Reversals
Finally, Cardwell discovered the
existence of positive and negative
reversals in the RSI. Reversals are the
opposite of divergence. For example, a

Chunk 4869 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
opposite of divergence. For example, a
positive reversal occurs when an uptrend price correction results in a higher low compared to the last price
correction, while RSI results in a lower low compared to the prior correction. A negative reversal happens when a
downtrend rally results in a lower high compared to the last downtrend rally, but RSI makes a higher high compared
to the prior rally.

Chunk 4870 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
to the prior rally.
In other words, despite stronger momentum as seen by the higher high or lower low in the RSI, price could not make
a higher high or lower low. This is evidence the main trend is about to resume. Cardwell noted that positive reversals
only happen in uptrends while negative reversals only occur in downtrends, and therefore their existence confirms
the trend.
Cutler's RSI

Chunk 4871 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
the trend.
Cutler's RSI
A variation called Cutler's RSI is based on a simple moving average of U and D,[2] instead of the exponential
average above. Cutler had found that since Wilder used an exponential moving average to calculate RSI, the value of
Wilder's RSI depended upon where in the data file his calculations started. Cutler termed this Data Length
Dependency. Cutler's RSI is not data length dependent, and returns consistent results regardless of the length of, or

Chunk 4872 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
the starting point within a data file.
Cutler's RSI generally comes out slightly different from the normal Wilder RSI, but the two are similar, since SMA
and EMA are also similar.Relative Strength Index 128

Stochastic oscillator
In technical analysis of securities trading, the stochastics oscillator is a momentum indicator that uses support and
resistance levels. Dr. George Lane promoted this indicator in the 1950s. The term stochastic refers to the location of
a current price in relation to its price range over a period of time.[1] This method attempts to predict price turning

Chunk 4874 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
points by comparing the closing price of a security to its price range.
The indicator is defined as follows:
where H and L are respectively the highest and the lowest price over the last periods, and
In working with %D it is important to remember that there is only one valid signal—a divergence between %D
and the security with which you are working.[2]
Definition
Stochastics Fast & Slow
The calculation above finds the range between an
asset’s high and low price during a given period of

Chunk 4875 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
time. The current securities price is then expressed as a
percentage of this range with 0% indicating the bottom
of the range and 100% indicating the upper limits of the
range over the time period covered. The idea behind
this indicator is that prices tend to close near the
extremes of the recent range before turning points. The
Stochastic oscillator is calculated:
Where
is the last closing price
is the lowest
price over the last N periods
is the highest price over the last N periods

Chunk 4876 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):

is a 3-period exponential moving average of %D.
A 3-line Stochastics will give you an anticipatory signal in %K, a signal in the turnaround of %D at or before a
bottom, and a confirmation of the turnaround in %D-Slow.[3] Typical values for N are 5, 9, or 14 periods. Smoothing
the indicator over 3 periods is standard.Stochastic oscillator 129

Chunk 4877 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Dr. George Lane, a financial analyst, is one of the first to publish on the use of stochastic oscillators to forecast
prices. According to Lane, the Stochastics indicator is to be used with cycles, Elliot Wave Theory and Fibonacci
retracement for timing. In low margin, calendar futures spreads, you might use Wilders parabolic as a trailing stop
after a stochastics entry. A centerpiece of his teaching is the divergence and convergence of trendlines drawn on

Chunk 4878 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
stochastics, as diverging/converging to trendlines drawn on price cycles. Stochastics predicts tops and bottoms.
Interpretation
The signal to act is when you have a divergence-convergence, in an extreme area, with a crossover on the right hand
side, of a cycle bottom.[4] As plain crossovers can occur frequently, one typically waits for crossovers occurring
together with an extreme pullback, after a peak or trough in the %D line. If price volatility is high, an exponential

Chunk 4879 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
moving average of the %D indicator may be taken, which tends to smooth out rapid fluctuations in price.
Stochastics attempts to predict turning points by comparing the closing price of a security to its price range. Prices
tend to close near the extremes of the recent range just before turning points. In the case of an uptrend, prices tend to
make higher highs, and the settlement price usually tends to be in the upper end of that time period's trading range.

Chunk 4880 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
When the momentum starts to slow, the settlement prices will start to retreat from the upper boundaries of the range,
causing the stochastic indicator to turn down at or before the final price high.[5]
An alert or set-up is present when the %D line is in an extreme area and diverging from the price action. The actual
signal takes place when the faster % K line crosses the % D line.[6]
Divergence-convergence is an indication that the momentum in the market is waning and a reversal may be in the

Chunk 4881 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
making. The chart below illustrates an example of where a divergence in stochastics relative to price forecasts a
reversal in the price's direction.

This is when prices pop through and keep on going - that is, break out.
Rules to follow:
Increase long position — When price crosses the upper band from below.
Increase short position — When price crosses the lower band from above.

the past N days, and 0 is a close today at the highest high of the past N days.
Buy-/Sell-Signalling

Chunk 4887 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Buy-/Sell-Signalling
Williams used a 10 trading day period and considered values below -80 as oversold and above -20 as overbought.
But they were not to be traded directly, instead his rule to buy an oversold was
•%R reaches -100%.
•Five trading days pass since -100% was last reached
•%R rises above -95% or -85%.
or conversely to sell an overbought condition
•%R reaches 0%.
•Five trading days pass since 0% was last reached
•%R falls below -5% or -15%.

Chunk 4888 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
•%R falls below -5% or -15%.
The timeframe can be changed for either more sensitive or smoother results. The more sensitive you make it, though,
the more false signals you will get.
Notes
Due to the equivalence
the %R indicator is arithmetically exactly equivalent to the %K stochastic oscillator, mirrored at the 0%-line, when
using the same time interval.132

INDICATORS: Volume
Volume (finance)
Volume, or trading volume, is a term in capital markets, referring to the number of shares or contracts traded in a
security or in an entire market during a given period of time.
In the context of stock trading on a stock exchange, the volume is commonly reported as the number of shares that
changed hands during the day. Average volume is reported as the average volume over a longer period of time,

Chunk 4890 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
normally one to three months. When the significant positive or negative news is made public about a company, the
volume of the company's stock will usually deviate from its average volume, meaning that more people are trading
this stock.
Higher volume for a stock is an indicator of higher liquidity. For institutional investors who wish to sell a large
number of shares of a certain stock, lower volume will force them to sell the stock slowly over a longer period of
time.
Legal implications

Chunk 4891 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
time.
Legal implications
The calculation of the volume of a security has some legal implications. For example, in the United States, a person
who sells a certain number of shares of a security in proportion to its weekly volume may be deemed an underwriter
of that security under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933. The calculation of the trading volume is therefore
regulated by the SEC[1] .

Formula
This ranges from -1 when the close is the low of the day, to +1 when it's the high. For instance if the close is 3/4 the
way up the range then CLV is +0.5. The accumulation/distribution index adds up volume multiplied by the CLV
factor, ie.

used, not the actual level of the total.
The name accumulation/distribution comes from the idea that during accumulation buyers are in control and the
price will be bid up through the day, or will make a recovery if sold down, in either case more often finishing near
the day's high than the low. The opposite applies during distribution.
The accumulation/distribution index is similar to on balance volume, but acc/dist is based on the close within the

Chaikin oscillator
A Chaikin oscillator is formed by subtracting a 10-day exponential moving average from a 3-day exponential
moving average of the accumulation/distribution index. Being an indicator of an indicator, it can give various sell or
buy signals, depending on the context and other indicators.

Money Flow Index
Money Flow Index (MFI) is an oscillator calculated over an N-day period, ranging from 0 to 100, showing money
flow on up days as a percentage of the total of up and down days. Money flow in technical analysis is typical price
multiplied by volume, a kind of approximation to the dollar value of a day's trading.

Chunk 4897 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The calculations are as follows. The typical price for each day is the average of high, low and close,
Money flow is the product of typical price and the volume on that day.
Totals of the money flow amounts over the given N days are then formed. Positive money flow is the total for those
days where the typical price is higher than the previous day's typical price, and negative money flow where below. (If
typical price is unchanged then that day is discarded.) A money ratio is then formed

Chunk 4898 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
From which a money flow index ranging from 0 to 100 is formed,
This can be expressed equivalently as follows. This form makes it clearer how the MFI is a percentage,
MFI is used as an oscillator. A value of 80 is generally considered overbought, or a value of 20 oversold.
Divergences between MFI and price action are also considered significant, for instance if price makes a new rally
high but the MFI high is less than its previous high then that may indicate a weak advance, likely to reverse.

Chunk 4899 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
It will be noted the MFI is constructed in a similar fashion to the relative strength index. Both look at up days against
total up plus down days, but the scale, i.e. what is accumulated on those days, is volume (or dollar volume
approximation rather) for the MFI, as opposed to price change amounts for the RSI.
It's important to be clear about what "money flow" means. It refers to dollar volume, i.e. the total value of shares

Chunk 4900 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
traded. Sometimes finance commentators speak of money "flowing into" a stock, but that expression only refers to
the enthusiasm of buyers (obviously there's never any net money in or out, because for every buyer there's a seller of
the same amount).
For the purposes of the MFI, "money flow", i.e. dollar volume, on an up day is taken to represent the enthusiasm of
buyers, and on a down day to represent the enthusiasm of sellers. An excessive proportion in one direction or the

Chunk 4901 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):

On-balance volume
On-balance volume (OBV) is a technical analysis indicator intended to relate price and volume in the stock market.
OBV is based on a cumulative total volume.[1]
The formula
Application

Chunk 4902 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The formula
Application
Total volume for each day is assigned a positive or negative value depending on prices being higher or lower that
day. A higher close results in the volume for that day to get a positive value, while a lower close results in negative
value.[2] So, when prices are going up, OBV should be going up too, and when prices make a new rally high, then
OBV should too. If OBV fails to go past its previous rally high, then this is a negative divergence, suggesting a weak
move.[3]

Chunk 4903 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
move.[3]
The technique, originally called "cumulative volume" by Woods and Vignolia, was later named in 1946, "on-balance
volume" by Joseph Granville who popularized the technique in his 1963 book Granville's New Key to Stock Market
Profits[1] . The index can be applied to stocks individually based upon their daily up or down close, or to the market
as a whole, using breadth of market data, i.e. the advance/decline ratio.[1]

Chunk 4904 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
OBV is generally used to confirm price moves.[4] The idea is that volume is higher on days where the price move is
in the dominant direction, for example in a strong uptrend more volume on up days than down days.[5]

Volume Price Trend
Volume Price Trend (VPT) (sometimes Price Volume Trend) is a technical analysis indicator intended to relate
price and volume in the stock market. VPT is based on a running cumulative volume that adds or subtracts a multiple

Chunk 4907 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
of the percentage change in share price trend and current volume, depending upon their upward or downward
movements.[1]
Formula
The starting point for the VPT total, i.e. the zero point, is arbitrary. Only the shape of the resulting indicator is used,
not the actual level of the total.
VPT is similar to On-balance Volume (OBV),[2] but where OBV takes volume just according to whether the close
was higher or lower, VPT includes how much higher or lower it was.

Chunk 4908 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
VPT is interpreted in similar ways to OBV. Generally, the idea is that volume is higher on days with a price move in
the dominant direction, for example in a strong uptrend more volume on up days than down days. So, when prices
are going up, VPT should be going up too, and when prices make a new rally high, VPT should too. If VPT fails to
go past its previous rally high then this is a negative divergence, suggesting a weak move.

Force Index
The Force Index (FI) is an indicator used in technical analysis to illustrate how strong the actual buying or selling
pressure is. High positive values mean there is a strong rising trend, and low values signify a strong downward trend.

Chunk 4911 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The FI is calculated by multiplying the difference between the last and previous closing prices by the volume of the
commodity, yielding a momentum scaled by the volume. The strength of the force is determined by a larger price
change or by a larger volume.
The FI was created by Alexander Elder.
Negative volume index
Nearly 75 years have passed since Paul L. Dysart, Jr. invented the Negative Volume Index and Positive Volume

Chunk 4912 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Index indicators. The indicators remain useful to identify primary market trends and reversals.
In 1936, Paul L. Dysart, Jr. began accumulating two series of advances and declines distinguished by whether
volume was greater or lesser than the prior day’s volume. He called the cumulative series for the days when volume
had been greater than the prior day’s volume the Positive Volume Index (PVI), and the series for the days when
volume had been lesser the Negative Volume Index (NVI).

Chunk 4913 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
A native of Iowa, Dysart worked in Chicago’s LaSalle Street during the 1920s. After giving up his Chicago Board of
Trade membership, he published an advisory letter geared to short-term trading using advance-decline data. In 1933,
he launched the Trendway weekly stock market letter and published it until 1969 when he died. Dysart also
developed the 25-day Plurality Index, the 25-day total of the absolute difference between the number of advancing

Chunk 4914 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
issues and the number of declining issues, and was a pioneer in using several types of volume of trading studies.
Dysart’s NVI and PVI
The daily volume of the New York Stock Exchange and the NYSE Composite Index’s advances and declines drove
Dysart’s indicators. Dysart believed that “volume is the driving force in the market.” He began studying market
breath numbers in 1931, and was familiar with the work of Col. Leonard P. Ayres and James F. Hughes, who

Chunk 4915 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
pioneered the tabulation of advances and declines to interpret stock market movements.
Dysart calculated NVI as follows: 1) if today’s volume is less than yesterday’s volume, subtract declines from
advances, 2) add the difference to the cumulative NVI beginning at zero, and 3) retain the current NVI reading for
the days when volume is greater than the prior day’s volume. He calculated PVI in the same manner but for the days

Chunk 4916 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
when volume was greater than the prior day’s volume. NVI and PVI can be calculated daily or weekly.
Initially, Dysart believed that PVI would be the more useful series, but in 1967, he wrote that NVI had “proved to be
the most valuable of all the breath indexes.” He relied most on NVI, naming it AMOMET, the acronym of “A
Measure Of Major Economic Trend.”
Dysart’s theory, expressed in his 1967 Barron's article, was that “if volume advances and prices move up or down in

Chunk 4917 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
accordance [with volume], the move is assumed to be a good movement - if it is sustained when the volume
subsides.” In other words, after prices have moved up on positive volume days, "if prices stay up when the volume
subsides for a number of days, we can say that such a move is 'good'." If the market “holds its own on negative
volume days after advancing on positive volume, the market is in a strong position.”

Chunk 4918 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
He called PVI the “majority” curve. Dysart distinguished between the actions of the “majority” and those of the
“minority.” The majority tends to emulate the minority, but its timing is not as sharp as that of the minority. When
the majority showed an appetite for stocks, the PVI was usually “into new high ground” as happened in 1961.Negative volume index 138
It is said that the two indicators assume that "smart" money is traded on quiet days (low volume) and that the crowd

Chunk 4919 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
trades on very active days. Therefore, the negative volume index picks out days when the volume is lower than on
the previous day, and the positive index picks out days with a higher volume.
Dysart’s Interpretation of NVI and PVI
Besides an article he wrote for Barron’s in 1967, not many of Dysart’s writings are available. What can be interpreted
about Dysart’s NVI is that whenever it rises above a prior high, and the DJIA is trending up, a “Bull Market Signal”

Chunk 4920 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
is given. When the NVI falls below a prior low, and the DJIA is trending down, a “Bear Market Signal” is given. The
PVI is interpreted in reverse. However, not all movements above or below a prior NVI or PVI level generate signals,
as Dysart also designated “bullish” and “bearish penetrations.” These penetrations could occur before or after a Bull
or Bear Market Signal, and at times were called “reaffirmations” of a signal. In 1969, he articulated one rule: “signals

Chunk 4921 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
are most authentic when the NVI has moved sideways for a number of months in a relatively narrow range.” Dysart
cautioned that “there is no mathematical system devoid of judgment which will continuously work without error in
the stock market.”
According to Dysart, between 1946 and 1967, the NVI “rendered 17 significant signals,” of which 14 proved to be
right (an average of 4.32% from the final high or low) and 3 wrong (average loss of 6.33%). However, NVI

Chunk 4922 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
“seriously erred” in 1963-1964 and in 1968, which concerned him. In 1969, Dysart reduced the weight he had
previously given to the NVI in his analyses because NVI was no longer a “decisive” indicator of the primary trend,
although it retained an “excellent ability to give us ‘leading’ indications of short-term trend reversals.”
A probable reason for the NVI losing its efficacy during the mid-1960s may have been the steadily higher NYSE

Chunk 4923 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
daily volume due to the dramatic increase in the number of issues traded so that prices rose on declining volume.
Dysart’s NVI topped out in 1955 and trended down until at least 1968, although the DJIA moved higher during that
period. Norman G. Fosback has attributed the “long term increase in the number of issues traded” as a reason for a
downward bias in a cumulative advance-decline line. Fosback was the next influential technician in the story of NVI
and PVI.
Fosback’s Variations

Chunk 4924 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
and PVI.
Fosback’s Variations
Fosback studied NVI and PVI and in 1976 reported his findings in his classic Stock Market Logic. He did not
elucidate on the indicators’ background or mentioned Dysart except for saying that “in the past Negative Volume
Indexes have always [his emphasis] been constructed using advance-decline data….” He posited, “There is no good
reason for this fixation on the A/D Line. In truth, a Negative Volume Index can be calculated with any market index

Chunk 4925 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
- the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, or even ‘unweighted’ market measures…. Somehow this point has
escaped the attention of technicians to date.”
The point had not been lost on Dysart, who wrote in Barron’s, “we prefer to use the issues-traded data [advances and
declines] rather than the price data of any average because it is more all-encompassing, and more truly represents
what’s happening in the entire market.” Dysart was a staunch proponent of using advances and declines.

Chunk 4926 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Fosback made three variations to NVI and PVI:
1. He cumulated the daily percent change in the market index rather than the difference between advances and
declines. On negative volume days, he calculated the price change in the index from the prior day and added it to the
most recent NVI. His calculations are as follows:
If Ct and Cy denote the closing prices of today and yesterday, respectively, the NVI for today is calculated by

Chunk 4927 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
•adding NVIyesterday (Ct - Cy) / Cy to yesterday's NVI if today's volume is lower than yesterday's, adding zero
otherwise,
and the PVI is calculated by:Negative volume index 139
•adding PVIyesterday (Ct - Cy) / Cy to yesterday's PVI if today's volume is higher than yesterday's, adding zero
otherwise.
2. He suggested starting the cumulative count at a base index level such as 100.
3. He derived buy or sell signals by whether the NVI or PVI was above or below its one-year moving average.

Chunk 4928 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Fosback’s versions of NVI and PVI are what are popularly described in books and posted on Internet financial sites.
Often reported are his findings that whenever NVI is above its one-year moving average there is a 96% (PVI - 79%)
probability that a bull market is in progress, and when it is below its one-year moving average, there is a 53% (PVI -
67%) probability that a bear market is in place. These results were derived using a 1941-1975 test period. Modern

Chunk 4929 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
tests might reveal different probabilities.
Today, NVI and PVI are commonly associated with Fosback’s versions, and Dysart, their inventor, is forgotten. It
cannot be said that one version is better than the other. While Fosback provided a more objective interpretation of
these indicators, Dysart’s versions offer value to identify primary trends and short-term trend reversals.
Although some traders use Fosback’s NVI and PVI to analyze individual stocks, the indicators were created to track,

Chunk 4930 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
and have been tested, on major market indexes. NVI was Dysart’s most invaluable breath index, and Fosback found
that his version of “the Negative Volume Index is an excellent indicator of the primary market trend.” Traders can
benefit from both innovations.

Chunk 4934 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
INDICATORS: Volatility
Volatility (finance)
In finance, volatility most frequently refers to the standard deviation of the continuously compounded returns of a
financial instrument within a specific time horizon. It is common for discussions to talk about the volatility of a
security's price, even while it is the returns' volatility that is being measured. It is used to quantify the risk of the

Chunk 4935 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
financial instrument over the specified time period. Volatility is normally expressed in annualized terms, and it may
either be an absolute number ($5) or a fraction of the mean (5%).
Volatility terminology
Volatility as described here refers to the actual current volatility of a financial instrument for a specified period (for
example 30 days or 90 days). It is the volatility of a financial instrument based on historical prices over the specified

period with the last observation the most recent price. This phrase is used particularly when it is wished to
distinguish between the actual current volatility of an instrument and

the last observation on a date in the past
•actual future volatility which refers to the volatility of a financial instrument over a specified period starting at

the current time and ending at a future date (normally the expiry date of an option)

•current implied volatility which refers to the implied volatility observed from current prices of the financial
instrument
•future implied volatility which refers to the implied volatility observed from future prices of the financial
instrument

Chunk 4938 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
instrument
For a financial instrument whose price follows a Gaussian random walk, or Wiener process, the width of the
distribution increases as time increases. This is because there is an increasing probability that the instrument's price
will be farther away from the initial price as time increases. However, rather than increase linearly, the volatility
increases with the square-root of time as time increases, because some fluctuations are expected to cancel each other

Chunk 4939 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
out, so the most likely deviation after twice the time will not be twice the distance from zero.
Since observed price changes do not follow Gaussian distributions, others such as the Lévy distribution are often
used.[1] These can capture attributes such as "fat tails".
Volatility for investors
Investors care about volatility for five reasons. 1) The wider the swings in an investment's price the harder

Chunk 4940 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
emotionally it is to not worry. 2) When certain cash flows from selling a security are needed at a specific future date,
higher volatility means a greater chance of a shortfall. 3) Higher volatility of returns while saving for retirement
results in a wider distribution of possible final portfolio values. 4) Higher volatility of return when retired gives
withdrawals a larger permanent impact on the portfolio's value. 5) Price volatility presents opportunities to buy assets

Chunk 4941 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
cheaply and sell when overpriced. [2]
In today's markets, it is also possible to trade volatility directly, through the use of derivative securities such as
options and variance swaps. See Volatility arbitrage.Volatility (finance) 142
Volatility versus direction
Volatility does not measure the direction of price changes, merely their dispersion. This is because when calculating
standard deviation (or variance), all differences are squared, so that negative and positive differences are combined

Chunk 4942 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
into one quantity. Two instruments with different volatilities may have the same expected return, but the instrument
with higher volatility will have larger swings in values over a given period of time.
For example, a lower volatility stock may have an expected (average) return of 7%, with annual volatility of 5%.
This would indicate returns from approximately -3% to 17% most of the time (19 times out of 20, or 95%). A higher

Chunk 4943 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
volatility stock, with the same expected return of 7% but with annual volatility of 20%, would indicate returns from
approximately -33% to 47% most of the time (19 times out of 20, or 95%). These estimates assume a normal
distribution; in reality stocks are found to be leptokurtotic.
Volatility is a poor measure of risk, as explained by Peter Carr, "it is only a good measure of risk if you feel that
being rich then being poor is the same as being poor then rich".
Volatility over time

Volatility over time
Although the Black Scholes equation assumes predictable constant volatility, none of these are observed in real
markets, and amongst the models are Bruno Dupire's Local Volatility, Poisson Process where volatility jumps to new
levels with a predictable frequency, and the increasingly popular Heston model of Stochastic Volatility.[3]
It's common knowledge that types of assets experience periods of high and low volatility. That is, during some

Chunk 4945 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
periods prices go up and down quickly, while during other times they might not seem to move at all.
Periods when prices fall quickly (a crash) are often followed by prices going down even more, or going up by an
unusual amount. Also, a time when prices rise quickly (a bubble) may often be followed by prices going up even
more, or going down by an unusual amount.
The converse behavior, 'doldrums' can last for a long time as well.

Chunk 4946 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Most typically, extreme movements do not appear 'out of nowhere'; they're presaged by larger movements than
usual. This is termed autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity. Of course, whether such large movements have
the same direction, or the opposite, is more difficult to say. And an increase in volatility does not always presage a
further increase—the volatility may simply go back down again.
Mathematical definition

Chunk 4947 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Mathematical definition
The annualized volatility σ is the standard deviation of the instrument's yearly logarithmic returns.
The generalized volatility σT for time horizon T in years is expressed as:
Therefore, if the daily logarithmic returns of a stock have a standard deviation of σSD and the time period of returns
is P, the annualized volatility is
A common assumption is that P = 1/252 (there are 252 trading days in any given year). Then, if σSD = 0.01 the
annualized volatility is

The formula used above to convert returns or volatility measures from one time period to another assume a particular
underlying model or process. These formulas are accurate extrapolations of a random walk, or Wiener process,
whose steps have finite variance. However, more generally, for natural stochastic processes, the precise relationship

Chunk 4949 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
between volatility measures for different time periods is more complicated. Some use the Lévy stability exponent α
to extrapolate natural processes:
If α = 2 you get the Wiener process scaling relation, but some people believe α < 2 for financial activities such as
stocks, indexes and so on. This was discovered by Benoît Mandelbrot, who looked at cotton prices and found that
they followed a Lévy alpha-stable distribution with α = 1.7. (See New Scientist, 19 April 1997.)

Chunk 4950 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Crude volatility estimation
Using a simplification of the formulas above it is possible to estimate annualized volatility based solely on
approximate observations. Suppose you notice that a market price index, which has a current value near 10,000, has
moved about 100 points a day, on average, for many days. This would constitute a 1% daily movement, up or down.
To annualize this, you can use the "rule of 16", that is, multiply by 16 to get 16% as the annual volatility. The

Chunk 4951 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
rationale for this is that 16 is the square root of 256, which is approximately the number of trading days in a year
(252). This also uses the fact that the standard deviation of the sum of n independent variables (with equal standard
deviations) is √n times the standard deviation of the individual variables.
Of course, the average magnitude of the observations is merely an approximation of the standard deviation of the

Chunk 4952 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
market index. Assuming that the market index daily changes are normally distributed with mean zero and standard
deviation σ, the expected value of the magnitude of the observations is √(2/π)σ = 0.798σ. The net effect is that this
crude approach overestimates the true volatility by about 25%.

Average True Range
Average True Range (ATR) is a technical analysis volatility indicator originally developed by J. Welles Wilder, Jr.
for commodities[1] . The indicator does not provide an indication of price trend, simply the degree of price
volatility.[2] The average true range is an N-day exponential moving average of the true range values. Wilder
recommended a 14-period smoothing. [3]
Calculation

Chunk 4958 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Calculation
The range of a day's trading is simply . The true range extends it to yesterday's closing price if it was
outside of today's range.
The true range is the largest of the:
•Most recent period's high less the most recent period's low
•Absolute value of the most recent period's high less the previous close
•Absolute value of the most recent period's low less the previous close

Chunk 4959 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The idea of ranges is that they show the commitment or enthusiasm of traders. Large or increasing ranges suggest
traders prepared to continue to bid up or sell down a stock through the course of the day. Decreasing range suggests
waning interest.Average True Range 145

Bollinger Bands
S&P 500 with 20 day, two standard deviation Bollinger Bands, %b and BandWidth.
Bollinger Bands is a technical analysis
tool invented by John Bollinger in the
1980s. Having evolved from the
concept of trading bands, Bollinger
Bands can be used to measure the
highness or lowness of the price

Chunk 4962 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
highness or lowness of the price
relative to previous trades.
Bollinger Bands consist of:
•a middle band being an N-period
simple moving average (MA)
•an upper band at K times an
N-period standard deviation above
the middle band (MA + Kσ)
•a lower band at K times an N-period
standard deviation below the middle
band (MA − Kσ)
Typical values for N and K are 20 and
2, respectively. The default choice for the average is a simple moving average, but other types of averages can be

Chunk 4963 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
employed as needed. Exponential moving averages are a common second choice. [1] Usually the same period is used
for both the middle band and the calculation of standard deviation.[2]Bollinger Bands 146
Purpose
The purpose of Bollinger Bands is to provide a relative definition of high and low. By definition, prices are high at
the upper band and low at the lower band. This definition can aid in rigorous pattern recognition and is useful in

Chunk 4964 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
comparing price action to the action of indicators to arrive at systematic trading decisions.[3]
Indicators derived from Bollinger Bands
There are two indicators derived from Bollinger Bands, %b and BandWidth.
%b, pronounced 'percent b', is derived from the formula for Stochastics and tells you where you are in relation to the
bands. %b equals 1 at the upper band and 0 at the lower band. Writing upperBB for the upper Bollinger Band,

Chunk 4965 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
lowerBB for the lower Bollinger Band, and last for the last (price) value:
%b = (last − lowerBB) / (upperBB − lowerBB)
BandWidth tells you how wide the Bollinger Bands are on a normalized basis. Writing the same symbols as before,
and middleBB for the moving average, or middle Bollinger Band:
BandWidth = (upperBB − lowerBB) / middleBB
Using the default parameters of a 20-period look back and plus/minus two standard deviations, BandWidth is equal

Chunk 4966 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
to four times the 20-period coefficient of variation.
Uses for %b include system building and pattern recognition. Uses for BandWidth include identification of
opportunities arising from relative extremes in volatility and trend identification.
In a series of lectures at The World Money Show in Hong Kong, Asian Traders Investment Conference in Singapore,
the Italian Trading Forum in Rimini, Italy, The European Technical Analysis Conference in London, England and

Chunk 4967 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
the Market Technicians Symposium in New York, USA, all in Spring of 2010, John Bollinger introduced three new
indicators based on Bollinger Bands. They are BB Impulse, which measures price change as a function of the bands,
BandWidth Percent, which normalizes the width of the bands over time, and BandWidth Delta, which quantifies the
changing width of the bands.
Interpretation
The use of Bollinger Bands varies widely among traders. Some traders buy when price touches the lower Bollinger

Chunk 4968 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Band and exit when price touches the moving average in the center of the bands. Other traders buy when price
breaks above the upper Bollinger Band or sell when price falls below the lower Bollinger Band.[4] Moreover, the use
of Bollinger Bands is not confined to stock traders; options traders, most notably implied volatility traders, often sell
options when Bollinger Bands are historically far apart or buy options when the Bollinger Bands are historically

Chunk 4969 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
close together, in both instances, expecting volatility to revert back towards the average historical volatility level for
the stock.
When the bands lie close together a period of low volatility in stock price is indicated. When they are far apart a
period of high volatility in price is indicated. When the bands have only a slight slope and lie approximately parallel
for an extended time the price of a stock will be found to oscillate up and down between the bands as though in a
channel.

Chunk 4970 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
channel.
Traders are often inclined to use Bollinger Bands with other indicators to see if there is confirmation. In particular,
the use of an oscillator like Bollinger Bands will often be coupled with a non-oscillator indicator like chart patterns
or a trendline; if these indicators confirm the recommendation of the Bollinger Bands, the trader will have greater
evidence that what the bands forecast is correct.Bollinger Bands 147
Effectiveness

Chunk 4971 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Effectiveness
A recent study concluded that Bollinger Band trading strategies may be effective in the Chinese marketplace, stating:
"Finally, we find significant positive returns on buy trades generated by the contrarian version of the moving average
crossover rule, the channel breakout rule, and the Bollinger Band trading rule, after accounting for transaction costs
of 0.50 percent." Nauzer J. Balsara, Gary Chen and Lin Zheng The Chinese Stock Market: An Examination of the

Chunk 4972 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Random Walk Model and Technical Trading Rules.[5] (By "the contrarian version", they mean buying when the
conventional rule mandates selling, and vice versa.)
A paper by Rostan, Pierre, Théoret, Raymond and El moussadek, Abdeljalil from 2008 at SSRN uses Bollinger
Bands in forecasting the yield curve.[6]
In his 2006 master's thesis, Oliver Douglas Williams at the University of Western Ontario studied Bollinger Bands

Chunk 4973 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
and suggested that fundamental analysis was key to setting Bollinger Band parameters, a process John Bollinger
dubbed rational analysis. Williams concluded: "Alone, Bollinger Bands do not seem to yield the extraordinary
results. Fundamental analysis is required to determine the best moving average window to match the business cycle
of the asset. When combined with other techniques such as fundamental analysis, Bollinger Bands can give

Chunk 4974 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
systematic traders a method of choosing their buy and sell points."[7]
Companies like Forbes suggest that the use of Bollinger Bands is a simple and often an effective strategy but
stop-loss orders should be used to mitigate losses from market pressure.[8]
Statistical properties
Security prices have no known statistical distribution, normal or otherwise; they are known to have fat tails,

Chunk 4975 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
compared to the Normal.[9] The sample size typically used, 20, is too small for conclusions derived from statistical
techniques like the Central Limit Theorem to be reliable. Such techniques usually require the sample to be
independent and identically distributed which is not the case for a time series like security prices.
For these three primary reasons, it is incorrect to assume that the percentage of the data outside the Bollinger Bands

Chunk 4976 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
will always be limited to a certain amount. So, instead of finding about 95% of the data inside the bands, as would be
the expectation with the default parameters if the data were normally distributed, one will typically find less; how
much less is a function of the security's volatility.

Donchian channel
The Donchian channel is an indicator used in market trading developed by Richard Donchian. It is formed by taking

Chunk 4985 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
the highest high of the daily maxima and the lowest low of the daily minima of the last n days, then marking the area
between those values on a chart.
The Donchian channel is a useful indicator for seeing the volatility of a market price. If a price is stable the
Donchian channel will be relatively narrow. If the price fluctuates a lot the Donchian channel will be wider. Its
primary use, however, is for providing signals for long and short positions. If a security trades above its highest n

Chunk 4986 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
day high, then a long is established. If it trades below its lowest n day low, then a short is established.

Standard deviation

Chunk 4987 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Standard deviation
A plot of a normal distribution (or bell curve). Each colored band has a width of one
standard deviation.
Standard deviation is a widely used
measurement of variability or diversity
used in statistics and probability
theory. It shows how much variation or
"dispersion" there is from the
"average" (mean, or expected/budgeted
value). A low standard deviation
indicates that the data points tend to be
very close to the mean, whereas high
standard deviation indicates that the

Chunk 4988 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
standard deviation indicates that the
data are spread out over a large range
of values.
Technically, the standard deviation of
a statistical population, data set, or probability distribution is the square root of its variance. It is algebraically
simpler though practically less robust than the average absolute deviation.[1]Standard deviation 150
Cumulative probability of a normal distribution
with expected value 0 and standard deviation 1
A data set with a mean of 50 (shown in blue) and

Chunk 4989 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
A data set with a mean of 50 (shown in blue) and
a standard deviation (σ) of 20.
Example of two sample populations with the
same mean and different standard deviations. Red
population has mean 100 and SD 10; blue
population has mean 100 and SD 50.
[2] A useful property of standard deviation is that, unlike variance, it is
expressed in the same units as the data. Note, however, that for
measurements with percentage as unit, the standard deviation will have
percentage points as unit.

Chunk 4990 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
percentage points as unit.
In addition to expressing the variability of a population, standard
deviation is commonly used to measure confidence in statistical
conclusions. For example, the margin of error in polling data is
determined by calculating the expected standard deviation in the results
if the same poll were to be conducted multiple times. The reported
margin of error is typically about twice the standard deviation – the

Chunk 4991 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
radius of a 95 percent confidence interval. In science, researchers
commonly report the standard deviation of experimental data, and only
effects that fall far outside the range of standard deviation are
considered statistically significant – normal random error or variation
in the measurements is in this way distinguished from causal variation.
Standard deviation is also important in finance, where the standard
deviation on the rate of return on an investment is a measure of the

Chunk 4992 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
volatility of the investment.
When only a sample of data from a population is available, the
population standard deviation can be estimated by a modified quantity
called the sample standard deviation, explained below.
Basic examples
Consider a population consisting of the following eight values:
These eight data points have the mean (average) of 5:
To calculate the population standard deviation, first compute the difference of each data point from the mean, and

Chunk 4993 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
square the result of each:Standard deviation 151
Next compute the average of these values, and take the square root:
This quantity is the population standard deviation; it is equal to the square root of the variance. The formula is
valid only if the eight values we began with form the complete population. If they instead were a random sample,
drawn from some larger,  “parent” population, then we should have used 7 (n − 1) instead of 8 (n) in the denominator

Chunk 4994 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
of the last formula, and then the quantity thus obtained would have been called the sample standard deviation. See
the section Estimation below for more details.
A slightly more complicated real life example, the average height for adult men in the United States is about 70",
with a standard deviation of around 3". This means that most men (about 68%, assuming a normal distribution) have

Chunk 4995 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
a height within 3" of the mean (67"–73") — one standard deviation — and almost all men (about 95%) have a height
within 6" of the mean (64"–76") — two standard deviations. If the standard deviation were zero, then all men would
be exactly 70" high. If the standard deviation were 20", then men would have much more variable heights, with a
typical range of about 50"–90". Three standard deviations account for 99.7% of the sample population being studied,

Chunk 4996 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
assuming the distribution is normal (bell-shaped).
Definition of population values
Let X be a random variable with mean value μ:
Here the operator E denotes the average or expected value of X. Then the standard deviation of X is the quantity
That is, the standard deviation σ (sigma) is the square root of the average value of (X − μ)2.
The standard deviation of a (univariate) probability distribution is the same as that of a random variable having that

Chunk 4997 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
distribution. Not all random variables have a standard deviation, since these expected values need not exist. For
example, the standard deviation of a random variable that follows a Cauchy distribution is undefined because its
expected value μ is undefined.
Discrete random variable
In the case where X takes random values from a finite data set x1, x2, …, xN, with each value having the same
probability, the standard deviation is
or, using summation notation,

Chunk 4998 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
or, using summation notation,
If, instead of having equal probabilities, the values have different probabilities, let x1 have probability p1, x2 have
probability p2, ..., xN have probability pN. In this case, the standard deviation will beStandard deviation 152
Continuous random variable
The standard deviation of a continuous real-valued random variable X with probability density function p(x) is
where

Chunk 4999 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
where
and where the integrals are definite integrals taken for x ranging over the set of possible values of the random
variable X.
In the case of a parametric family of distributions, the standard deviation can be expressed in terms of the
parameters. For example, in the case of the log-normal distribution with parameters μ and σ2, the standard deviation
is [(exp(σ2) − 1)exp(2μ + σ2)]1/2.
Estimation

Chunk 5000 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
is [(exp(σ2) − 1)exp(2μ + σ2)]1/2.
Estimation
One can find the standard deviation of an entire population in cases (such as standardized testing) where every
member of a population is sampled. In cases where that cannot be done, the standard deviation σ is estimated by
examining a random sample taken from the population. Some estimators are given below:

An estimator for σ sometimes used is the standard deviation of the sample, denoted by sN and defined as follows:
This estimator has a uniformly smaller mean squared error than the sample standard deviation (see below), and is the
maximum-likelihood estimate when the population is normally distributed. But this estimator, when applied to a
small or moderately sized sample, tends to be too low: it is a biased estimator.

Chunk 5002 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The standard deviation of the sample is the same as the population standard deviation of a discrete random variable
that can assume precisely the values from the data set, where the probability for each value is proportional to its
multiplicity in the data set.
With sample standard deviation
The most common estimator for σ used is an adjusted version, the sample standard deviation, denoted by s and
defined as follows:

Chunk 5003 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
defined as follows:
where are the observed values of the sample items and is the mean value of these observations.
This correction (the use of N − 1 instead of N) is known as Bessel's correction. The reason for this correction is that
s2 is an unbiased estimator for the variance σ2 of the underlying population, if that variance exists and the sample
values are drawn independently with replacement. However, s is not an unbiased estimator for the standard deviation

Chunk 5004 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
σ; it tends to underestimate the population standard deviation.Standard deviation 153
The term standard deviation of the sample is used for the uncorrected estimator (using N) while the term sample
standard deviation is used for the corrected estimator (using N − 1). The denominator N − 1 is the number of degrees
of freedom in the vector of residuals, .
Other estimators
Although an unbiased estimator for σ is known when the random variable is normally distributed, the formula is

Chunk 5005 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
complicated and amounts to a minor correction. Moreover, unbiasedness (in this sense of the word) is not always
desirable.
Identities and mathematical properties
The standard deviation is invariant under changes in location, and scales directly with the scale of the random
variable. Thus, for a constant c and random variables X and Y:
The standard deviation of the sum of two random variables can be related to their individual standard deviations and
the covariance between them:

Chunk 5006 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
the covariance between them:
where and stand for variance and covariance, respectively.
The calculation of the sum of squared deviations can be related to moments calculated directly from the data. The
standard deviation of the sample can be computed as:
The sample standard deviation can be computed as:
For a finite population with equal probabilities at all points, we have
Thus, the standard deviation is equal to the square root of (the average of the squares less the square of the average).

Chunk 5007 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
See computational formula for the variance for a proof of this fact, and for an analogous result for the sample
standard deviation.
Interpretation and application
A large standard deviation indicates that the data points are far from the mean and a small standard deviation
indicates that they are clustered closely around the mean.
For example, each of the three populations {0, 0, 14, 14}, {0, 6, 8, 14} and {6, 6, 8, 8} has a mean of 7. Their

Chunk 5008 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
standard deviations are 7, 5, and 1, respectively. The third population has a much smaller standard deviation than the
other two because its values are all close to 7. In a loose sense, the standard deviation tells us how far from the mean
the data points tend to be. It will have the same units as the data points themselves. If, for instance, the data set {0, 6,
8, 14} represents the ages of a population of four siblings in years, the standard deviation is 5 years.

Chunk 5009 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
As another example, the population {1000, 1006, 1008, 1014} may represent the distances traveled by four athletes,
measured in meters. It has a mean of 1007 meters, and a standard deviation of 5 meters.Standard deviation 154
Standard deviation may serve as a measure of uncertainty. In physical science, for example, the reported standard
deviation of a group of repeated measurements should give the precision of those measurements. When deciding

Chunk 5010 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
whether measurements agree with a theoretical prediction, the standard deviation of those measurements is of crucial
importance: if the mean of the measurements is too far away from the prediction (with the distance measured in
standard deviations), then the theory being tested probably needs to be revised. This makes sense since they fall
outside the range of values that could reasonably be expected to occur if the prediction were correct and the standard

Chunk 5011 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
deviation appropriately quantified. See prediction interval.
Application examples
The practical value of understanding the standard deviation of a set of values is in appreciating how much variation
there is from the "average" (mean).
Climate
As a simple example, consider the average daily maximum temperatures for two cities, one inland and one on the
coast. It is helpful to understand that the range of daily maximum temperatures for cities near the coast is smaller

Chunk 5012 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
than for cities inland. Thus, while these two cities may each have the same average maximum temperature, the
standard deviation of the daily maximum temperature for the coastal city will be less than that of the inland city as,
on any particular day, the actual maximum temperature is more likely to be farther from the average maximum
temperature for the inland city than for the coastal one.
Sports

Chunk 5013 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Sports
Another way of seeing it is to consider sports teams. In any set of categories, there will be teams that rate highly at
some things and poorly at others. Chances are, the teams that lead in the standings will not show such disparity but
will perform well in most categories. The lower the standard deviation of their ratings in each category, the more
balanced and consistent they will tend to be. Whereas, teams with a higher standard deviation will be more

Chunk 5014 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
unpredictable. For example, a team that is consistently bad in most categories will have a low standard deviation. A
team that is consistently good in most categories will also have a low standard deviation. However, a team with a
high standard deviation might be the type of team that scores a lot (strong offense) but also concedes a lot (weak
defense), or, vice versa, that might have a poor offense but compensates by being difficult to score on.

Chunk 5015 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Trying to predict which teams, on any given day, will win, may include looking at the standard deviations of the
various team "stats" ratings, in which anomalies can match strengths vs. weaknesses to attempt to understand what
factors may prevail as stronger indicators of eventual scoring outcomes.
In racing, a driver is timed on successive laps. A driver with a low standard deviation of lap times is more consistent

Chunk 5016 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
than a driver with a higher standard deviation. This information can be used to help understand where opportunities
might be found to reduce lap times.
Finance
In finance, standard deviation is a representation of the risk associated with a given security (stocks, bonds, property,
etc.), or the risk of a portfolio of securities (actively managed mutual funds, index mutual funds, or ETFs). Risk is an

Chunk 5017 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
important factor in determining how to efficiently manage a portfolio of investments because it determines the
variation in returns on the asset and/or portfolio and gives investors a mathematical basis for investment decisions
(known as mean-variance optimization). The overall concept of risk is that as it increases, the expected return on the
asset will increase as a result of the risk premium earned – in other words, investors should expect a higher return on

Chunk 5018 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
an investment when said investment carries a higher level of risk, or uncertainty of that return. When evaluating
investments, investors should estimate both the expected return and the uncertainty of future returns. Standard
deviation provides a quantified estimate of the uncertainty of future returns.Standard deviation 155
For example, let's assume an investor had to choose between two stocks. Stock A over the past 20 years had an

Chunk 5019 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
average return of 10 percent, with a standard deviation of 20 percentage points (pp) and Stock B, over the same
period, had average returns of 12 percent but a higher standard deviation of 30 pp. On the basis of risk and return, an
investor may decide that Stock A is the safer choice, because Stock B's additional two percentage points of return is
not worth the additional 10 pp standard deviation (greater risk or uncertainty of the expected return). Stock B is

Chunk 5020 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
likely to fall short of the initial investment (but also to exceed the initial investment) more often than Stock A under
the same circumstances, and is estimated to return only two percent more on average. In this example, Stock A is
expected to earn about 10 percent, plus or minus 20 pp (a range of 30 percent to -10 percent), about two-thirds of the
future year returns. When considering more extreme possible returns or outcomes in future, an investor should

Chunk 5021 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
expect results of as much as 10 percent plus or minus 60 pp, or a range from 70 percent to −50 percent, which
includes outcomes for three standard deviations from the average return (about 99.7 percent of probable returns).
Calculating the average return (or arithmetic mean) of the return of a security over a given period will generate the
expected return of the asset. For each period, subtracting the expected return from the actual return results in the

Chunk 5022 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
difference from the mean. Squaring the difference in each period and taking the average gives the overall variance of
the return of the asset. The larger the variance, the greater risk the security carries. Finding the square root of this
variance will give the standard deviation of the investment tool in question.
Population standard deviation is used to set the width of Bollinger Bands, a widely adopted technical analysis tool.

Chunk 5023 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
For example, the upper Bollinger Band is given as x + nσx. The most commonly used value for n is 2; there is about
a five percent chance of going outside, assuming a normal distribution of returns.
Geometric interpretation
To gain some geometric insights, we will start with a population of three values, x1, x2, x3. This defines a point P =
(x1, x2, x3) in R3. Consider the line L = {(r, r, r) : r ∈ R}. This is the "main diagonal" going through the origin. If our

Chunk 5024 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
three given values were all equal, then the standard deviation would be zero and P would lie on L. So it is not
unreasonable to assume that the standard deviation is related to the distance of P to L. And that is indeed the case. To
move orthogonally from L to the point P, one begins at the point:
whose coordinates are the mean of the values we started out with. A little algebra shows that the distance between P

Chunk 5025 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
and M (which is the same as the orthogonal distance between P and the line L) is equal to the standard deviation of
the vector x1, x2, x3, multiplied by the square root of the number of dimensions of the vector (3 in this case.)
Chebyshev's inequality
An observation is rarely more than a few standard deviations away from the mean. Chebyshev's inequality ensures
that, for all distributions for which the standard deviation is defined, the amount of data within a number of standard

Chunk 5026 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
deviations of the mean is at least as much as given in the following table.Standard deviation 156

Rules for normally distributed data
Dark blue is less than one standard deviation from the mean. For the normal distribution,
this accounts for 68.27 percent of the set; while two standard deviations from the mean
(medium and dark blue) account for 95.45 percent; three standard deviations (light,

Chunk 5027 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
medium, and dark blue) account for 99.73 percent; and four standard deviations account
for 99.994 percent. The two points of the curve that are one standard deviation from the
mean are also the inflection points.
The central limit theorem says that the
distribution of an average of many
independent, identically distributed
random variables tends toward the
famous bell-shaped normal distribution
with a probability density function of:

Chunk 5028 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
with a probability density function of:
where μ is the expected value of the random variable, σ equals its standard deviation divided by n1/2, and n is the
number of random variables. The standard deviation therefore is simply a scaling variable that adjusts how broad the
curve will be, though it also appears in the normalizing constant.
If a data distribution is approximately normal then the proportion of data values within z standard deviations of the
mean is defined by:
Proportion =

are within one standard deviation of the mean (mathematically, μ ± σ, where μ is the arithmetic mean), about 95
percent are within two standard deviations (μ ± 2σ), and about 99.7 percent lie within three standard deviations
(μ ± 3σ). This is known as the 68-95-99.7 rule, or the empirical rule.

Relationship between standard deviation and mean
The mean and the standard deviation of a set of data are usually reported together. In a certain sense, the standard

Chunk 5032 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
deviation is a "natural" measure of statistical dispersion if the center of the data is measured about the mean. This is
because the standard deviation from the mean is smaller than from any other point. The precise statement is the
following: suppose x1, ..., xn are real numbers and define the function:
Using calculus or by completing the square, it is possible to show that σ(r) has a unique minimum at the mean:

Chunk 5033 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Variability can also be measured by the coefficient of variation, which is the ratio of the standard deviation to the
mean. It is a dimensionless number.
Often we want some information about the precision of the mean we obtained. We can obtain this by determining the
standard deviation of the sampled mean. The standard deviation of the mean is related to the standard deviation of
the distribution by:

Chunk 5034 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
the distribution by:
where N is the number of observation in the sample used to estimate the mean. This can easily be proven with:
hence
Standard deviation 158
Resulting in:
Rapid calculation methods
The following two formulas can represent a running (continuous) standard deviation. A set of three power sums s0,
s1, s2 are each computed over a set of N values of x, denoted as x1, ..., xN:
Note that s0 raises x to the zero power, and since x0 is always 1, s0 evaluates to N.

Chunk 5035 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Given the results of these three running summations, the values s0, s1, s2 can be used at any time to compute the
current value of the running standard deviation:
Similarly for sample standard deviation,
In a computer implementation, as the three sj sums become large, we need to consider round-off error, arithmetic
overflow, and arithmetic underflow. The method below calculates the running sums method with reduced rounding
errors:
where A is the mean value.

Weighted calculation
When the values xi are weighted with unequal weights wi, the power sums s0, s1, s2 are each computed as:
And the standard deviation equations remain unchanged. Note that s0 is now the sum of the weights and not the
number of samples N.
The incremental method with reduced rounding errors can also be applied, with some additional complexity.
A running sum of weights must be computed:Standard deviation 159

where n is the total number of elements, and n' is the number of elements with non-zero weights. The above formulas
become equal to the simpler formulas given above if weights are taken as equal to one.
Combining standard deviations
Population-based statistics
The populations of sets, which may overlap, can be calculated simply as follows:

Chunk 5038 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Standard deviations of non-overlapping (X ∩ Y = ∅) sub-populations can be aggregated as follows if the size (actual
or relative to one another) and means of each are known:
For example, suppose it is known that the average American man has a mean height of 70 inches with a standard
deviation of three inches and that the average American woman has a mean height of 65 inches with a standard

Chunk 5039 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
deviation of two inches. Also assume that the number of men, N, is equal to the number of woman. Then the mean
and standard deviation of heights of American adults could be calculated as:

History
The term standard deviation was first used[4] in writing by Karl Pearson[5] in 1894, following his use of it in lectures.
This was as a replacement for earlier alternative names for the same idea: for example, Gauss used mean error.[6]

INDICATORS: Other
Advance decline line
The Advance/Decline line is a stock market technical indicator used by speculators to measure the number of
individual stocks participating in a market rise or fall. As price changes of large stocks can have a disproportionate
effect on capitalization weighted stock market indices such as the S&P 500, the NYSE Composite Index, and the
NASDAQ Composite index, it can be useful to know how broadly this movement extends into the larger universe of

Chunk 5049 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
smaller stocks. Since market indexes represent a group of stocks, they do not present the whole picture of the trading
day and the performance of the market during this day. Though the market indices give an idea about what has
happened during the trading day, advance/decline numbers give an idea about the individual performance of
particular stocks.
The Advance/Decline line is a plot of the cumulative sum of the daily difference between the number of issues

Chunk 5050 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
advancing and the number of issues declining in a particular stock market index. Thus it moves up when the index
contains more advancing than declining issues, and moves down when there are more declining than advancing
issues. The formula for ADL is[1] :
A/D Line = (# of Advancing Stocks - # of Declining Stocks) + Yesterday's A/D Line Value
The Advance/Decline Line (ADL) is the most popular of all internal indicators by far[1] .
Divergence

Chunk 5051 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Divergence
"Divergence" is when the stock market index moves in one direction while the ADL on that index moves in the
opposite direction[2] . If the index moves up while the ADL moves down, the index may be misleading about the true
direction of the overall market, as happened toward the end of the US Dot-com bubble in 1999-2000[3] , when the
indices continued to rally while the ADL diverged downward starting at the beginning of 1999. Such negative

Chunk 5052 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
divergence was also seen toward the end of the roaring twenties bull market, during 1972 at the height of the Nifty
Fifty market[4] , and starting in March 2008 before the late-2008 market collapse[5] .
Advance/Decline Numbers Application
There may be cases in which an index reports a gain at the end of the trading day. This gain may be caused by an
increase in a certain number of stocks. However, a significant lead by declining stocks may be observed relative to
the advancing stocks.[6]

Chunk 5053 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
the advancing stocks.[6]
However, these results should be interpreted as a decline in the market, no matter that the index has experienced an
increase. Therefore, you should base your judgments regarding the performance of the market on the
advance/decline numbers, not on the performance of a particular index no matter how broad it is.
There have been many cases in which a major increase in an index was not accompanied by an increase in the

Chunk 5054 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
advance number. In such a case it is reasonable to conclude that by the end of the trading day the index will decline.
The reverse is also true. For instance, if there is a significant movement in the advance/decline numbers, you can
expect a movement in the different indexes as well.
Additionally, a market that experiences a trend toward either a decline or an advance is highly unlikely to reverse its
movement immediately on the next trading day.Advance decline line 163

Chunk 5055 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Advance/decline numbers can be also used in your daily observations of the trades in order to determine whether a
particular trend is a false or a spot.
Finally, use advance/decline numbers whenever you need to make a judgment on the performance of the market.
These numbers can also give you understanding on the movements of the indexes.

Commodity Channel Index
The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is an oscillator originally introduced by Donald Lambert in an article
published in the October 1980 issue of Commodities magazine (now known as Futures magazine).
Since its introduction, the indicator has grown in popularity and is now a very common tool for traders in identifying
cyclical trends not only in commodities, but also equities and currencies. The CCI can be adjusted to the timeframe

Chunk 5059 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
of the market traded on by changing the averaging period.
Calculation
The CCI is calculated as the difference between the typical price of a commodity and its simple moving average,
divided by the mean absolute deviation of the typical price. The index is usually scaled by an inverse factor of 0.015
to provide more readable numbers:
,
where the pt is the , SMA is the simple moving average, and σ is the mean
absolute deviation.

Chunk 5060 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
absolute deviation.
For scaling purposes, Lambert set the constant at 0.015 to ensure that approximately 70 to 80 percent of CCI values
would fall between -100 and +100. The CCI fluctuates above and below zero. The percentage of CCI values that fall
between +100 and -100 will depend on the number of periods used. A shorter CCI will be more volatile with a
smaller percentage of values between +100 and -100. Conversely, the more periods used to calculate the CCI, theCommodity Channel Index 164

Chunk 5061 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
higher the percentage of values between +100 and -100.
Interpretation
Traders and investors use the
Commodity Channel Index to help
identify price reversals, price extremes
and trend strength. As with most
indicators, the CCI should be used in
conjunction with other aspects of
technical analysis. CCI fits into the
momentum category of oscillators. In
addition to momentum, volume
indicators and the price chart may also
influence a technical assessment. It is
often used for detecting divergences

Chunk 5062 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
often used for detecting divergences
from price trends as an
overbought/oversold indicator, and to
draw patterns on it and trade according to those patterns. In this respect, it is similar to bollinger bands, but is
presented as an indicator rather than as overbought/oversold levels.
The CCI typically oscillates above and below a zero line. Normal oscillations will occur within the range of +100

Chunk 5063 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
and -100. Readings above +100 imply an overbought condition, while readings below -100 imply an oversold
condition. As with other overbought/oversold indicators, this means that there is a large probability that the price will
correct to more representative levels.
The CCI has seen substantial growth in popularity amongst technical investors; today's traders often use the indicator
to determine cyclical trends in not only commodities, but also equities and currencies.[1]

Chunk 5064 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The CCI, when used in conjunction with other oscillators, can be a valuable tool to identify potential peaks and
valleys in the asset's price, and thus provide investors with reasonable evidence to estimate changes in the direction
of price movement of the asset.[1]
Lambert's trading guidelines for the CCI focused on movements above +100 and below -100 to generate buy and sell
signals. Because about 70 to 80 percent of the CCI values are between +100 and -100, a buy or sell signal will be in

Chunk 5065 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
force only 20 to 30 percent of the time. When the CCI moves above +100, a security is considered to be entering into
a strong uptrend and a buy signal is given. The position should be closed when the CCI moves back below +100.
When the CCI moves below -100, the security is considered to be in a strong downtrend and a sell signal is given.
The position should be closed when the CCI moves back above -100.

Chunk 5066 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Since Lambert's original guidelines, traders have also found the CCI valuable for identifying reversals. The CCI is a
versatile indicator capable of producing a wide array of buy and sell signals.
•CCI can be used to identify overbought and oversold levels. A security would be deemed oversold when the CCI
dips below -100 and overbought when it exceeds +100. From oversold levels, a buy signal might be given when

Chunk 5067 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
the CCI moves back above -100. From overbought levels, a sell signal might be given when the CCI moved back
below +100.
•As with most oscillators, divergences can also be applied to increase the robustness of signals. A positive
divergence below -100 would increase the robustness of a signal based on a move back above -100. A negative
divergence above +100 would increase the robustness of a signal based on a move back below +100.

Chunk 5068 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
•Trend line breaks can be used to generate signals. Trend lines can be drawn connecting the peaks and troughs. 
From oversold levels, an advance above -100 and trend line breakout could be considered bullish. FromCommodity Channel Index 165
overbought levels, a decline below +100 and a trend line break could be considered bearish.[2]

Chunk 5070 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):

Coppock curve
The Coppock curve or Coppock indicator is a technical analysis indicator for long-term stock market investors
created by E.S.C. Coppock, first published in Barron's Magazine on October 15, 1962.[1]
The indicator is designed for use on a monthly time scale. It's the sum of a 14-month rate of change and 11-month
rate of change, smoothed by a 10-period weighted moving average.
.

Chunk 5071 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
.
Coppock, the founder of Trendex Research in San Antonio, Texas,[2] was an economist. He had been asked by the
Episcopal Church to identify buying opportunities for long-term investors. He thought market downturns were like
bereavements and required a period of mourning. He asked the church bishops how long that normally took for
people, their answer was 11 to 14 months and so he used those periods in his calculation.[3]

Chunk 5072 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
A buy signal is generated when the indicator is below zero and turns upwards from a trough. No sell signals are
generated (that not being its design). The indicator is trend-following, and based on averages, so by its nature it
doesn't pick a market bottom, but rather shows when a rally has become established.
Coppock designed the indicator (originally called the "Trendex Model"[1] ) for the S&P 500 index, and it's been

Chunk 5073 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
applied to similar stock indexes like the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It's not regarded as well-suited to commodity
markets, since bottoms there are more rounded than the spike lows found in stocks.[4]
Variations
Although designed for monthly use, a daily calculation over the same period can be made, converting the periods to
294 day and 231 day rate of changes, and a 210 day weighted moving average.[5]

Chunk 5074 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
A slightly different version of the indicator is still used by the Investors Chronicle, a British investment magazine.
The main difference is that the Investors Chronicle version does include the sell signals, although it stresses that they
are to be treated with caution. This is because such signals could merely be a dip in a continuing bull market.[6]Coppock curve 166

Keltner channel
Keltner channel example
Keltner channel is a technical analysis indicator showing a central
moving average line plus channel lines at a distance above and below.
The indicator is named after Chester W. Keltner (1909-1998) who
described it in his 1960 book How To Make Money in Commodities.

Chunk 5079 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
But this name was applied only by those who heard about it from him,
Keltner called it the Ten-Day Moving Average Trading Rule and
indeed made no claim to any originality for the idea.
In Keltner's description the centre line is an 10-day simple moving
average of typical price, where typical price each day is the average of
high, low and close,
The lines above and below are drawn a distance from that centre line, a distance which is the simple moving average

Chunk 5080 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
of the past 10 days' trading ranges (ie. range high to low on each day).
The trading strategy is to regard a close above the upper line as a strong bullish signal, or a close below the lower
line as strong bearish sentiment, and buy or sell with the trend accordingly, but perhaps with other indicators to
confirm.
The origin of this idea is uncertain. Keltner was a Chicago grain trader and perhaps it was common knowledge

Chunk 5081 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
among traders of the day. Or in the 1930s as a young man Keltner worked for Ralph Ainsworth (1884-1965)
backtested trading systems submitted when Ainsworth offered a substantial prize for a winning strategy, so it could
have been among those. But ideas of channels with fixed-widths go back to the earliest days of charting, so perhaps
applying some averaging is not an enormous leap in any case.

Chunk 5082 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Later authors, such as Linda Bradford Raschke, have published modifications for the Keltner channel, such as 
different averaging periods; or an exponential moving average; or using a multiple of Wilder's average true range 
(ATR) for the bands. These variations have merit, but are often still just called Keltner channel, creating someKeltner channel 167
confusion as to what exactly one gets from an indicator called that.

McClellan Oscillator
The McClellan Oscillator is a market breadth indicator used by financial analysts of the New York Stock Exchange
to evaluate the rate of money entering or leaving the market and interpretively indicate overbought or oversold
conditions of the market.[1]
History

Chunk 5085 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
conditions of the market.[1]
History
Developed by Sherman and Marian McClellan in 1969, the Oscillator is computed using the exponential moving
average (EMA) of the daily ordinal difference of advancing issues (stocks which gained in value) from declining
issues (stocks which fell in value) over 39 trading day and 19 trading day periods.
How it works
The simplified formula for determining the Oscillator is:

Chunk 5086 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The McClellan Summation Index (MSI) is calculated by adding each day's McClellan Oscillator to the previous
day's Summation Index.
By using the Summation Index of the Mcclellan Oscillator, you can judge the markets overall bullishness or
bearishness.
MSI properties
•above zero it is considered to be bullish (positive growth)
•below zero it is considered to be bearish (negative growth)
The Summation Index is oversold at -1000 to -1250 or overbought at 1000 to 1250. [1]

Chunk 5087 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The number of stocks in a stock market determine the dynamic range of the MSI. For the NZSX (one of the smallest
exchanges in the English speaking world) the MSI would probably range between (-50 ... +50), the 19 and 39
constants (used for the US exchanges) would have to be revised. For the NZSX a MSI moving average mechanism
might be needed to smooth out the perturbations of such a small number of traded stocks.McClellan Oscillator 168

Ulcer Index

Chunk 5089 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
indices/ McSumNYSE. html)
Ulcer Index
The Ulcer Index is a stock market risk measure or technical analysis indicator devised by Peter Martin in 1987,[1]
and published by him and Byron McCann in their 1989 book The Investors Guide to Fidelity Funds. It's designed as
a measure of volatility, but only volatility in the downward direction, i.e. the amount of drawdown or retracement
occurring over a period.

Chunk 5090 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
occurring over a period.
Other volatility measures like standard deviation treat up and down movement equally, but a trader doesn't mind
upward movement, it's the downside that causes stress and stomach ulcers that the index's name suggests. (The name
pre-dates the discovery, described in the ulcer article, that most gastric ulcers are actually caused by a bacterium.)
The term Ulcer Index has also been used (later) by Steve Shellans, editor and publisher of MoniResearch Newsletter

Chunk 5091 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
for a different calculation, also based on the ulcer causing potential of drawdowns.[2] Shellans index is not described
in this article.
Calculation
The index is based on a given past period of N days. Working from oldest to newest a highest price (highest closing
price) seen so-far is maintained, and any close below that is a retracement, expressed as a percentage
For example if the high so far is $5.00 then a price of $4.50 is a retracement of -10%. The first R is always 0, there

Chunk 5092 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
being no drawdown from a single price. The quadratic mean (or root mean square) of these values is taken, similar to
a standard deviation calculation.
The squares mean it doesn't matter if the R values are expressed as positives or negatives, both come out as a
positive Ulcer Index.
The calculation is relatively immune to the sampling rate used. It gives similar results when calculated on weekly

Chunk 5093 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
prices as it does on daily prices. Martin advises against sampling less often than weekly though, since for instance
with quarterly prices a fall and recovery could take place entirely within such a period and thereby not appear in the
index.Ulcer Index 169
Usage
Martin recommends his index as a measure of risk in various contexts where usually the standard deviation (SD) is
used for that purpose. For example the Sharpe ratio, which rates an investment's excess return (return above a safe

Chunk 5094 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
cash rate) against risk, is
The ulcer index can replace the SD to make an Ulcer Performance Index (UPI) or Martin ratio,
In both cases annualized rates of return would be used (net of costs, inclusive of dividend reinvestment, etc.).
The index can also be charted over time and used as a kind of technical analysis indicator, to show stocks going into
ulcer-forming territory (for one's chosen time-frame), or to compare volatility in different stocks.[3] As with the

Chunk 5095 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Sharpe Ratio, a higher value is better than a lower value (investors prefer more return for less risk).

Ultimate Oscillator

Chunk 5097 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
Ultimate Oscillator
The Ultimate Oscillator is a technical analysis oscillator developed by Larry Williams based on a notion of buying
or selling "pressure" represented by where a day's closing price falls within the day's true range.
The calculation starts with "buying pressure", which is the amount by which the close is above the "true low" on a
given day. The true low is the lesser of the given day's trading low and the previous close.

Chunk 5098 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
The true range (the same as used in average true range) is the difference between the "true high" and the true low
above. The true high is the greater of the given day's trading high and the previous close.
The total buying pressure over the past 7 days is expressed as a fraction of the total true range over the same period.
If is today, is yesterday, etc, then
The same is done for the past 14 days and past 28 days and the resulting three ratios combined in proportions 4:2:1,

Chunk 5099 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
and scaled to make a percentage 0 to 100. The idea of the 7, 14 and 28 day periods is to combine short, intermediate
and longer time frames.
Williams had specific criteria for a buy or sell signal. A buy signal occurs when,
•Bullish divergence between price and the oscillator is observed, meaning prices make new lows but the oscillator
doesn't
•During the divergence the oscillator has fallen below 30.

Chunk 5100 (Source: technical-analysis-PDFdrive.txt):
•The oscillator then rises above its high during the divergence, ie. the high in between the two lows. The buy
trigger is the rise through that high.
The position is closed when the oscillator rises above 70 (considered overbought), or a rise above 50 but then a
fallback through 45.
A sell signal is generated conversely on a bearish divergence above level 70, to be subsequently closed out below 30
(as oversold).
